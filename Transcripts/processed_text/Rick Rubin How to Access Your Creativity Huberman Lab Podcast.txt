00:04:08 Maui Nui Venison, Thesis, WHOOP, Momentous

will record conversation, will post clip Huberman Lab Clips
channel. begin, like emphasize podcast separate
teaching research roles Stanford. is, however, part desire effort
bring zero cost consumer information science science-related tools
general public. keeping theme, like thank sponsors today's
podcast. first sponsor Maui Nui, can confidently say nutrient-
dense delicious red meat available. Maui Nui spent nearly decade building
USDA-certified, wild harvesting system help balance invasive deer populations
island Maui. talked podcast, guests podcast,
emphasized critical role getting quality protein, not just muscle repair
protein synthesis also repair tissues, including brain tissue, day-to-
day basis. general rule thumb 1 gram quality protein, per pound
body weight, per day. Maui Nui meats, can accomplish easily,
can without ingesting excess calories, also critical
immediate long-term health. say, Maui Nui meets not
extremely high quality, also delicious. particularly like jerky,
venison jerky. also Maui Nui venison various recipes, including ground

probably heard say before, not fan word nootropics,
nootropics means smart drugs, frankly, brain doesn't work way. brain


neural circuits focus. also neural circuits creativity neural circuits
task switching imagination memory. no thing neural
circuit smart, therefore, word nootropics doesn't really apply
anything specific, neurobiologically speaking. Thesis understands this, therefore,
designed custom nootropics tailored unique needs. using
Thesis year now, nootropic formulas game-changer
me, particular realm cognitive work. go-to formula

00:08:23 Creativity & Ideas, Cloud Analogy

spelled O-U-S, livemomentous.com/huberman. now discussion Rick
Rubin. Great today, Rick. RICK RUBIN: Thank me.
pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: topics science, particular
neuroscience, confess creativity difficult one capture.
can find papers, scientific studies is, convergent thinking versus divergent
thinking, definitions these, take different forms.
strict definition form, seems creativity something either rearranging
existing elements coming new elements. went book,
done twice. read twice, way, feel blessed honored
gotten early copy you, final copy early is. gone
twice, now convinced may not actually internal source creativity
exists right. example give that, me, really serving
anchor, tell wrong here, idea ideas creativity
little bit like cloud. look one moment, might think looks like one
thing, certain shape texture. look moment later,
quite bit different. look hour later, well gone.
reason think serves powerful hook think
creativity think neuroscientists scientists general never actually
captured way even talk creativity stems somebody knew
person but, know, greatly admire. don't many heroes, put Joe
Strummer among short list heroes have. remember interview
fairly disjointed. off different tangents couldn't follow. one
point, just blurted that, idea, write down.
may end throwing away, wait, will gone. remember that,
consequence, whole system use try capture ideas.
thoughts Joe said, cloud idea comes one form one area
book? think thread throughout book different ways.
come you, serve trying to-- don't want say extract--
trying access creativity? RICK RUBIN: think best way think like
dream. like, think dreams, don't necessarily make sense.
wake up, might remember part not whole thing. Then, start
writing down, come back, may not make sense you. There'll


series abstract images, maybe, someday future, able look back
understand mean, maybe not. art making process
works like making things, looking feeling ourselves.
feeling excitement enthusiasm, feeling interest, feeling curiosity--
want know more-- feeling leaning forward. following energy
body, feel something here. something here. want know
more. want know more. want know more. say, not intellectual process.

00:12:26 Language & Creativity; Kids

different thing. hard even talk it, elusive.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Recently, listening podcast friend Lex
Fridman. think episode Balaji Srinivasan, Balaji, investor-
type guy, thinker-type guy-- like eight-hour episode. says something
beginning love thoughts on. said, look, can train rat lever press
every time expect reward every even number press every odd number
press even every fifth number press. human rat can't like prime
number presses. can't actually train that. think reward
systems way follow life, get go sleep,
said fact can't means may not actually touch
best schedules things. Like every time thirsty, take sip. assume
right way it, might not optimal, whatever purpose.
reading book, thinking set things follow, things
pay attention to-- talk this-- things access, none creative process
comes just within us. can, always fed things outside it.
started is, second time read book, think
lens Balaji saying may not even language
thing call accessing creativity. process, language
form words little bit like trying use even numbers try access prime
numbers. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like math becomes
convoluted end conversation like this, confident can get
kernels it. remarkable book do. show
inform process. may not English language
saying, this, this, this, this, something creative


value. capture it? RICK RUBIN: Yes. think language insufficient drill
creativity. closer magic science. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
kids come world, think better access creative
process adults? start impart rule plays books. Like will
get likes? Will people like it? also things available us
not paying attention to, like texture table, discarding things,
systematically. get, quote, unquote, set ways. think kids are, just
definition design, creative adults? RICK RUBIN: Yes. Kids,
open, no baggage. don't belief system. don't know
things supposed work. just see is, pay attention
is, learn much we-- us select endless number data
points available us to, well, species, make sure don't die
procreate feed probably primary functions first.
learn things right wrong, learn things
certain things. inspired someone makes something love,
want way it. things undermine purity
creative process. can tools build skill set able yourself. Like
singer, might imitate singer really like get good
eventually come find voice. doesn't always start
voice. three years old five years old, try singing, not
singing like anyone else. singing voice. make
something, making based not knowing. think advantage, early
career, starting making music without experience, helpful,
didn't know rules breaking. wasn't intentional breaking
rules. just seemed right me,

00:17:36 Feelings & Creative Ideas

didn't realize things people wouldn't do. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: idea no new ideas. disagree, every
while, see hear something least seems different enough. RICK
RUBIN: think combination of-- new combination existing ideas presented
new way. think works. don't know. will say, seem like
things interesting series familiar elements joined together


way creating something never seen before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned close see hints creativity real
value feeling, also believe body great source information.
people will realize brain, course, skull, nervous
system extends everywhere body, whole mind-body thing just falls away.
Philosophers argued forever, silly argument. also true that,
God forbid, amputate limbs, amputated, fundamentally still
me. Right? not true took big enough chunk brain,
still survived. fundamentally different human being. still
name identity social security number, behave differently.
knows, maybe better? signals body know, least assume,
pretty generic. Like can think 50 different ways 100 ways talk
creativity today. define redefine carve serve like
sushi bunch different ways. body sends signals us are--
course understanding of. like, oh, stomach hurts, stomach feels
good, not sensing stomach. oh, feels good. feels warm. feels cold.
Like us aren't trained understanding interpret signals.
almost like vowels, syllables, isn't lot more. Whereas,
talk thoughts experiences, depending hyper verbal
somebody much emphasis put different sounds, near infinite. Not
infinite, near infinite. personally, know end
thread creativity-- maybe listening artist, hearing something.
like antennae start deflect certain way. Right?
feel body recognizable sensation, thought
sensation? RICK RUBIN: feeling body. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
localized? RICK RUBIN: No. feeling of-- say like surge energy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: remember first time experienced that? RICK
RUBIN: Probably hearing Beatles, three four years old. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Three four years old? RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wow. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: something wrong
Beatles never done me? RICK RUBIN: No. Maybe just weren't
exposed right time right way. no right wrong way, everyone--
can love Beatles, can not, right. not-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: glad can still friends. little concerned. little


scared ask question. know taste music little bit obscure
fragmentary, good. always felt like, gosh, must something wrong
me. like songs, don't-- no juice there. RICK RUBIN: think
maybe watch-- eight-part series called Beatles Anthology,
print. can try find somewhere, can watch together,
maybe that'll make case Beatles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Nothing
them, just always bothering story, like Ramones. saw that,
like, wow, like jeans, aviators, everyone change last name
Ramone, lot hated other. much drama there, three
chords just-- me, just like, wow, like kids New York, energy.

00:22:01 Rules, Choice & Art; Personal Taste & Other’s Opinions

think different things different people. Right? RICK RUBIN: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings question something feels
creatively right, sensing it, there, say studio maybe
even listening something somebody sent you, translate that,
given absence language? translate conversation
artist? again, writing comedy science podcasting,
matter. say that, keep going way, might not even
recognize it? guessing lot times, don't. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. Sometimes, don't. depends. the-- try setting
where, talking it, can engage moment. not much
good. say producing new record, played something,
thoughts it. wouldn't helpful tell were.
It'd better us wait till place try things see
goes. first thing wouldn't rely language it.
making suggestion something actionable. try it,
data. either moving good direction, moving away from--
moving towards away it, never know. always experiment.
maybe simple way talk like, gave two dishes food
asked taste tell one like better. Usually, pretty
straightforward, two choices, like better, think
creativity can boiled that. different wonder going


perform certain social media platforms? different it--
tasting two things, one want finish eating? say,
like one better, needs little salt, put little salt it. like, maybe
put much salt, know taste it. like simple. tune
enough really know feel face knowing
people might feel differently, part challenge. like, everyone tells
A, A, A, A, A, A, listen, like B, artist, important
able say, me, B. disconnect, much of, go
school, get us follow rules. art, different, rules
scaffolding chipped away, need be. Sometimes, helpful.
Sometimes, not, sometimes, even impose rules give
something shape. can decide make a-- going make painting,
going use green red colors allowed use.
decide advance, solve problem knowing
green red? can-- otherwise, infinite number choices,
anything can anything. like, sometimes choices not better. limiting
palate something manageable forces solve problems different way. Now,
digital age music-wise, can make anything digitally. no--
time when, didn't guitar studio, couldn't record guitar.
couldn't hire orchestra, couldn't orchestra recording. Now, can
just call things up. infinite choices, infinite choices don't
necessarily lead better compositions better final works. Understanding feel
face voices, without second guessing yourself, probably single
important thing practice artist. skill set develop artist know
feel, feelings. key not know, know
right you. doesn't work way. just know me, reason chose
artist demonstrate see it. undermining taste
commercial idea, defeats whole purpose this. not process
about. process me, showing am. can like
not, either way, still see it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that,
science, trained graduate students, graduate student,
blessed mentors, one real iconoclast. dead now.
Actually, advisors dead-- suicide, cancer, cancer. joke don't want
work you. morbid sense humor, laughing


this, someplace, right now. RICK RUBIN: thought going say ate
poison mushrooms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, last one said me,
common denominator, Andrew. thought, oh goodness, said, kind just
kidding, not really. little bit eerie. case, always said-- name
Ben-- always said, one thing can't teach taste, one predictor
people will never develop ones perfectionists.
filtering their-- perfectionists filter perfection
feedback others. always looking person putting little bit
middle finger feedback. Not much get things wrong,
can badly wrong science. can wrong right reasons, can also
wrong wrong reasons. people just almost compulsion
way believe doing. hearing that,
hearing describing. also think something
human empathic process emotional process, see somebody
something seem really not paying attention anyone else
doing-- guess crazy person street one version it, go
just experience, just crazy. somebody seems enjoying
emotion seems real, think good fraction people
feel gravitational pull, go, yeah, that. best example
remember growing skateboard thing first-- first
start baggy, sagging clothes thing, got teased endlessly one year
school. Then, bunch hip hop came out, guys wearing
sagging jeans shorts. Next year, come back, people
making fun us it, clicked me. like,
people don't actually know like. RICK RUBIN: No.

00:30:20 Changing Perspective & Creativity

ANDREW HUBERMAN: like like certainty people
like. question is, landscape creative stuff, real?
not real? almost like whoever can create convincing story least
captures good number of-- good fraction audiences, not
creative artist needs do. need actually depart that. right?
RICK RUBIN: Well just two different things. Like coming story


purpose pleasing someone else skill set, commercial endeavor
artistic endeavor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like tactical. Yeah. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
thinking, book, describe, again, thinking creative
process cloud, me, again, serves powerful anchor. think
biology, neurobiology, like strategy formation strategy implementation
almost sheer luck, miraculously, turn pages later book,
description animals trying accomplish something-- eat,
mate, find water, accomplish requirements living-- requires narrow visual
focus. something lab obsessed with, obsessed with.
narrow visual focus, know playbook becomes narrow.
rule set narrow. Now, point, order come new creative
idea, means broadening vision essential, way, broadening
thinking. RICK RUBIN: Well, either broadening narrowing,
changing aperture standard. reason present something
new maybe already knew didn't know knew it.
case, looking it. not unlike comedian does. Comedian
makes laugh. Usually, saying, outrageous, know
right. Just no one says way, no one said way before. always
truth makes funny. like that. idea recognizing
something seems really obvious, see it, seems like nobody else sees
it, no one else points out. feel like science like too, much
science, light flashes head, like got it, just seems like, well,
knew forever. No one knew it, know saying? like
obvious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN: obvious. think
another superpower artists accepting don't know anything. think
know things, also limits world. think know like this.
possible, nice little box. reality, say case?
say the-- take believe science now

00:33:55 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

decide throw away start scratch. probably create
whole different one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break


acknowledge sponsor, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens all-in-one vitamin
mineral probiotic drink also contains digestive enzymes adaptogens. started
taking Athletic Greens way back 2012. 10 years now taking Athletic
Greens every single day. delighted sponsoring podcast.
reason started taking Athletic Greens, reason still take Athletic Greens,
covers foundational nutritional needs. whether not eating well
enough not, sure covering needs vitamins, minerals,
probiotics, adaptogens combat stress, digestive enzymes really help
digestion. just feel much better drinking Athletic Greens. like try

00:35:04 Scientific Knowledge; Opinions & Art

claim special offer, month January, 10 free travel packs, plus year
supply vitamin D3 K2. offline conversation one time, asked good friend
mine, guest podcast, Eddie Chang, chair neurosurgery,
place top 1% neuroscientists. pulling speech people
completely paralyzed locked-in syndrome, et cetera. asked him,
percentage contained medical textbooks training-- RICK RUBIN:
Today ANDREW HUBERMAN: Today. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. went medical
school today, learned textbook, percentage
information accurate, percentage not? said, maybe half. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Right, asked, consequence that? said,
incalculable, completely agree. asked second time, still came
answer. good sign. Reliability experiment next
good. Yeah. think idea really know things. science,
observed amazing discoveries chance. observed amazing discoveries
incredible bouts hard work. cases, people spending lot time
lab. Like no one walked lab, saw something one day, Nobel Prize
winning discovery fundamental discovery. hanging lab lot. Just


came something didn't expect. Others drilling
toward answer. RICK RUBIN: cases, breakthroughs
happen-- guessing. don't know this-- considering assume information,
discovery true, based everything came it. everything
came wrong, discoveries probably built a-- know
saying? like context, everything happens takes account
context sitting fits context. Maybe context isn't right. knows?
don't know. saying, close things thinking, think
things, lot assumptions go it. new
discoveries essentially built top beliefs, beliefs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: remember-- course, listened Beastie Boys growing up.
didn't? child 90s, the-- Sabotage outgrowth
skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones like girl movies. worlds,
Beastie Boys skateboarding really closely interwoven while. people
know that. people don't. Spike formed bridge, Spike went off
started making bigger movies people watch. just use
example. heard say guys joking around, like
Beastie Boys, like guys hip hop, kind like hardcore scene,
New York, punk rock scene, joke. lot inside jokes.
working together, thought people might love it, might hate it,
just weren't paying attention all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention all.
Never considered it. no-- point time, making
Licensed Ill, hip hop music tiny underground thing. no one making hip hop
time thought ever mean anything. not realistic thought.
making really crazy friends, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think, nowadays, fact one can create something and, quote, unquote,
release quickly. can put something onto Twitter Instagram now.
10 seconds now, will get immediate feedback, external feedback,
course, can iterate basis feedback. think
problematic larger opportunity creativity? words, go back
20 years even 15 years, opportunity create certainly still there,
really didn't know going land you, quote, unquote, released it.
seems opportunity stay magical rainforest
creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: don't think wrong right. just information


can use not use use useful way. can make something
put out, people not like it. like, oh, still don't get it. going
got go harder. Like got go harder direction not-- know
saying? like not react away information. can helpful. can helpful
when-- different stories happen time.
making something, idea is. people engage
it, different idea is. like different reason
dislike reason different reason like it. can't
control things. part can control relate
thing make. external information undermines clarity
connection probably bad art guess. again, saying
experience. try make things-- ever tried make something like
something felt like missing fan wanted, nobody making it.
make it, wasn't-- always service love thing. want
something like this.

00:41:27 Finishing Projects; Source & Nature

No one else making one. make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
beautiful, word keeps coming mind almost like compulsion.
Like options ways behave function work life.
something compulsion, yanks us away opportunities, just
enough get back it. talked about, talk
book, notion source. me, again, can't help put neuroscientist
lens this. think source not one brain area function within
brain, touch bodily signals. Like feels right, doesn't?
like tasting two foods, love example. playbook far
vast short term adaptive playbook, like going get point
point B. yet, listen album song, assume there,
point, becomes not strategy development creativity strategy
implementation. Like needs songs going come order--
don't know much music. musician friends always laughing. RICK RUBIN:
not much music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, ordering
sequence melodies, et cetera. point one decide, OK, like


now's time get narrow focus effort? Like got it. run
this. component creative process involves packaging
finishing. part less satisfying you, just part larger
arc? RICK RUBIN: part same. nice. good feeling.
usually good feeling something done. one hand, commitment,
time say done, can keep experimenting
changing it. think, well, maybe tomorrow can make better, not finished.
keep thinking long time, can forever never put
anything. getting point ready sign off good feeling,
allows you-- one things talk book is, difficult thing
do, fun play, fun maybe not best yet. use
whatever next project going motivation finish one working
now. Like working this. spending time thing. really good.
believe can better, thing really want make.
keep tinkering one, never get make one. using projects
impetus finish something release world good one.
said description source something within us. don't know say
accurate. definitely us too, not us. think source
organizing principle everything, everything exists. trees grow,
mountains. anything can see outside world,
every discovery every piece art every new design every machine
outgrowths source energy. part antenna connects it,
maybe vehicle source allow things happen world. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: thank that, indeed misspeak. recall
distinctly book, described physical world constrained
laws physics certain things. imagination unconstrained. think
right, said work set somewhere those, neither one
other. ultimately feeds imagination way, indeed,
brain physical entity. nature outside world provides least
appears near infinite not infinite options. love example color
palette. restrict whatever sorts paints medium have,
restricted. nature, infinite number shades tones
combinations. RICK RUBIN: even one, pick rock look color
rock tried find paint match rock, never match.


much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different
scales, spatial scales, time scales too, spatial scales, delight comes
nature pictures-- seemed like '80s, like
see drop oil shot high resolution. beauty drop oil.
see Earth galaxy, beauty too, extremes.
course, daily perception

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go
different room, can't see model, paint model, instead of--
changes relationship. not just painting lines. painting
interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

work. talk writing book structure
unique. never encountered book kind structure before,
facile read ever, yet every single page, underlined, took notes, starred. like,
notice, worn, very, worn already time.
process removing functions day last week
going order get access this-- going think now

comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works
progress spend time listening day looking ideas. stay
far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since

places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going

unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present

process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish
things not happen way did, lot living past.
lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,
remember got staples stapled him. thought pretty intense.

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.

HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,

friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now

acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,

something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk

someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting

part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.
cases, example awareness meditation, mantra
meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince
give us suggestions one two can link listeners. sure
appreciate. RICK RUBIN: also meditation like practices
involve-- something called surgical series Monroe Institute
used surgery. listen recording. allows body
heal much faster remove trauma goes getting cut open--
traumatic. just listening certain things, can really powerful
effect, heal much faster. remember put surgery.
eyes closed. wasn't communicating anyone going
inside. wife me. came in. said, oh, already
gave Rick sedative ready go in. don't think gave anything.
like, look numbers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. Yeah, amazingly
powerful practice like anyone can cultivate. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely,
absolutely. no good bad version. really just-- learn technique
show it, works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, love
willing share process. Listen, just want say thank
number things. want thank music created
create want still ongoing, certainly time today sharing
thought process bit goes incredible creative process. want
thank writing book. don't talk feature many books
podcast. just not something typically do, seen little bit evolution
it. seen now read final form twice, mentioned.
going continue read again. one books
filled gems, like every chapter. take notes this. take notes this.
assembled digestible way allows people extract meaningful
parts every chapter. many way straightforward.
love book. thank certainly didn't write


book. happy did. know already benefited know
many people going benefit. amazing book. couldn't help put
neuroscience lens it. also, halfway through, learned discard pre-
existing lens bit start see things think different perspective.
just want thank incredible portal also
amazing friend. RICK RUBIN: Thank you. love you. happy you.

00:08:23 Creativity & Ideas, Cloud Analogy

spelled O-U-S, livemomentous.com/huberman. now discussion Rick
Rubin. Great today, Rick. RICK RUBIN: Thank me.
pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: topics science, particular
neuroscience, confess creativity difficult one capture.
can find papers, scientific studies is, convergent thinking versus divergent
thinking, definitions these, take different forms.
strict definition form, seems creativity something either rearranging
existing elements coming new elements. went book,
done twice. read twice, way, feel blessed honored
gotten early copy you, final copy early is. gone
twice, now convinced may not actually internal source creativity
exists right. example give that, me, really serving
anchor, tell wrong here, idea ideas creativity
little bit like cloud. look one moment, might think looks like one
thing, certain shape texture. look moment later,
quite bit different. look hour later, well gone.
reason think serves powerful hook think
creativity think neuroscientists scientists general never actually
captured way even talk creativity stems somebody knew
person but, know, greatly admire. don't many heroes, put Joe
Strummer among short list heroes have. remember interview
fairly disjointed. off different tangents couldn't follow. one
point, just blurted that, idea, write down.
may end throwing away, wait, will gone. remember that,
consequence, whole system use try capture ideas.
thoughts Joe said, cloud idea comes one form one area
book? think thread throughout book different ways.
come you, serve trying to-- don't want say extract--
trying access creativity? RICK RUBIN: think best way think like
dream. like, think dreams, don't necessarily make sense.
wake up, might remember part not whole thing. Then, start
writing down, come back, may not make sense you. There'll


series abstract images, maybe, someday future, able look back
understand mean, maybe not. art making process
works like making things, looking feeling ourselves.
feeling excitement enthusiasm, feeling interest, feeling curiosity--
want know more-- feeling leaning forward. following energy
body, feel something here. something here. want know
more. want know more. want know more. say, not intellectual process.

00:12:26 Language & Creativity; Kids

different thing. hard even talk it, elusive.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Recently, listening podcast friend Lex
Fridman. think episode Balaji Srinivasan, Balaji, investor-
type guy, thinker-type guy-- like eight-hour episode. says something
beginning love thoughts on. said, look, can train rat lever press
every time expect reward every even number press every odd number
press even every fifth number press. human rat can't like prime
number presses. can't actually train that. think reward
systems way follow life, get go sleep,
said fact can't means may not actually touch
best schedules things. Like every time thirsty, take sip. assume
right way it, might not optimal, whatever purpose.
reading book, thinking set things follow, things
pay attention to-- talk this-- things access, none creative process
comes just within us. can, always fed things outside it.
started is, second time read book, think
lens Balaji saying may not even language
thing call accessing creativity. process, language
form words little bit like trying use even numbers try access prime
numbers. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like math becomes
convoluted end conversation like this, confident can get
kernels it. remarkable book do. show
inform process. may not English language
saying, this, this, this, this, something creative


value. capture it? RICK RUBIN: Yes. think language insufficient drill
creativity. closer magic science. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
kids come world, think better access creative
process adults? start impart rule plays books. Like will
get likes? Will people like it? also things available us
not paying attention to, like texture table, discarding things,
systematically. get, quote, unquote, set ways. think kids are, just
definition design, creative adults? RICK RUBIN: Yes. Kids,
open, no baggage. don't belief system. don't know
things supposed work. just see is, pay attention
is, learn much we-- us select endless number data
points available us to, well, species, make sure don't die
procreate feed probably primary functions first.
learn things right wrong, learn things
certain things. inspired someone makes something love,
want way it. things undermine purity
creative process. can tools build skill set able yourself. Like
singer, might imitate singer really like get good
eventually come find voice. doesn't always start
voice. three years old five years old, try singing, not
singing like anyone else. singing voice. make
something, making based not knowing. think advantage, early
career, starting making music without experience, helpful,
didn't know rules breaking. wasn't intentional breaking
rules. just seemed right me,

00:17:36 Feelings & Creative Ideas

didn't realize things people wouldn't do. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: idea no new ideas. disagree, every
while, see hear something least seems different enough. RICK
RUBIN: think combination of-- new combination existing ideas presented
new way. think works. don't know. will say, seem like
things interesting series familiar elements joined together


way creating something never seen before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned close see hints creativity real
value feeling, also believe body great source information.
people will realize brain, course, skull, nervous
system extends everywhere body, whole mind-body thing just falls away.
Philosophers argued forever, silly argument. also true that,
God forbid, amputate limbs, amputated, fundamentally still
me. Right? not true took big enough chunk brain,
still survived. fundamentally different human being. still
name identity social security number, behave differently.
knows, maybe better? signals body know, least assume,
pretty generic. Like can think 50 different ways 100 ways talk
creativity today. define redefine carve serve like
sushi bunch different ways. body sends signals us are--
course understanding of. like, oh, stomach hurts, stomach feels
good, not sensing stomach. oh, feels good. feels warm. feels cold.
Like us aren't trained understanding interpret signals.
almost like vowels, syllables, isn't lot more. Whereas,
talk thoughts experiences, depending hyper verbal
somebody much emphasis put different sounds, near infinite. Not
infinite, near infinite. personally, know end
thread creativity-- maybe listening artist, hearing something.
like antennae start deflect certain way. Right?
feel body recognizable sensation, thought
sensation? RICK RUBIN: feeling body. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
localized? RICK RUBIN: No. feeling of-- say like surge energy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: remember first time experienced that? RICK
RUBIN: Probably hearing Beatles, three four years old. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Three four years old? RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wow. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: something wrong
Beatles never done me? RICK RUBIN: No. Maybe just weren't
exposed right time right way. no right wrong way, everyone--
can love Beatles, can not, right. not-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: glad can still friends. little concerned. little


scared ask question. know taste music little bit obscure
fragmentary, good. always felt like, gosh, must something wrong
me. like songs, don't-- no juice there. RICK RUBIN: think
maybe watch-- eight-part series called Beatles Anthology,
print. can try find somewhere, can watch together,
maybe that'll make case Beatles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Nothing
them, just always bothering story, like Ramones. saw that,
like, wow, like jeans, aviators, everyone change last name
Ramone, lot hated other. much drama there, three
chords just-- me, just like, wow, like kids New York, energy.

00:22:01 Rules, Choice & Art; Personal Taste & Other’s Opinions

think different things different people. Right? RICK RUBIN: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings question something feels
creatively right, sensing it, there, say studio maybe
even listening something somebody sent you, translate that,
given absence language? translate conversation
artist? again, writing comedy science podcasting,
matter. say that, keep going way, might not even
recognize it? guessing lot times, don't. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. Sometimes, don't. depends. the-- try setting
where, talking it, can engage moment. not much
good. say producing new record, played something,
thoughts it. wouldn't helpful tell were.
It'd better us wait till place try things see
goes. first thing wouldn't rely language it.
making suggestion something actionable. try it,
data. either moving good direction, moving away from--
moving towards away it, never know. always experiment.
maybe simple way talk like, gave two dishes food
asked taste tell one like better. Usually, pretty
straightforward, two choices, like better, think
creativity can boiled that. different wonder going


perform certain social media platforms? different it--
tasting two things, one want finish eating? say,
like one better, needs little salt, put little salt it. like, maybe
put much salt, know taste it. like simple. tune
enough really know feel face knowing
people might feel differently, part challenge. like, everyone tells
A, A, A, A, A, A, listen, like B, artist, important
able say, me, B. disconnect, much of, go
school, get us follow rules. art, different, rules
scaffolding chipped away, need be. Sometimes, helpful.
Sometimes, not, sometimes, even impose rules give
something shape. can decide make a-- going make painting,
going use green red colors allowed use.
decide advance, solve problem knowing
green red? can-- otherwise, infinite number choices,
anything can anything. like, sometimes choices not better. limiting
palate something manageable forces solve problems different way. Now,
digital age music-wise, can make anything digitally. no--
time when, didn't guitar studio, couldn't record guitar.
couldn't hire orchestra, couldn't orchestra recording. Now, can
just call things up. infinite choices, infinite choices don't
necessarily lead better compositions better final works. Understanding feel
face voices, without second guessing yourself, probably single
important thing practice artist. skill set develop artist know
feel, feelings. key not know, know
right you. doesn't work way. just know me, reason chose
artist demonstrate see it. undermining taste
commercial idea, defeats whole purpose this. not process
about. process me, showing am. can like
not, either way, still see it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that,
science, trained graduate students, graduate student,
blessed mentors, one real iconoclast. dead now.
Actually, advisors dead-- suicide, cancer, cancer. joke don't want
work you. morbid sense humor, laughing


this, someplace, right now. RICK RUBIN: thought going say ate
poison mushrooms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, last one said me,
common denominator, Andrew. thought, oh goodness, said, kind just
kidding, not really. little bit eerie. case, always said-- name
Ben-- always said, one thing can't teach taste, one predictor
people will never develop ones perfectionists.
filtering their-- perfectionists filter perfection
feedback others. always looking person putting little bit
middle finger feedback. Not much get things wrong,
can badly wrong science. can wrong right reasons, can also
wrong wrong reasons. people just almost compulsion
way believe doing. hearing that,
hearing describing. also think something
human empathic process emotional process, see somebody
something seem really not paying attention anyone else
doing-- guess crazy person street one version it, go
just experience, just crazy. somebody seems enjoying
emotion seems real, think good fraction people
feel gravitational pull, go, yeah, that. best example
remember growing skateboard thing first-- first
start baggy, sagging clothes thing, got teased endlessly one year
school. Then, bunch hip hop came out, guys wearing
sagging jeans shorts. Next year, come back, people
making fun us it, clicked me. like,
people don't actually know like. RICK RUBIN: No.

00:30:20 Changing Perspective & Creativity

ANDREW HUBERMAN: like like certainty people
like. question is, landscape creative stuff, real?
not real? almost like whoever can create convincing story least
captures good number of-- good fraction audiences, not
creative artist needs do. need actually depart that. right?
RICK RUBIN: Well just two different things. Like coming story


purpose pleasing someone else skill set, commercial endeavor
artistic endeavor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like tactical. Yeah. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
thinking, book, describe, again, thinking creative
process cloud, me, again, serves powerful anchor. think
biology, neurobiology, like strategy formation strategy implementation
almost sheer luck, miraculously, turn pages later book,
description animals trying accomplish something-- eat,
mate, find water, accomplish requirements living-- requires narrow visual
focus. something lab obsessed with, obsessed with.
narrow visual focus, know playbook becomes narrow.
rule set narrow. Now, point, order come new creative
idea, means broadening vision essential, way, broadening
thinking. RICK RUBIN: Well, either broadening narrowing,
changing aperture standard. reason present something
new maybe already knew didn't know knew it.
case, looking it. not unlike comedian does. Comedian
makes laugh. Usually, saying, outrageous, know
right. Just no one says way, no one said way before. always
truth makes funny. like that. idea recognizing
something seems really obvious, see it, seems like nobody else sees
it, no one else points out. feel like science like too, much
science, light flashes head, like got it, just seems like, well,
knew forever. No one knew it, know saying? like
obvious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN: obvious. think
another superpower artists accepting don't know anything. think
know things, also limits world. think know like this.
possible, nice little box. reality, say case?
say the-- take believe science now

00:33:55 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

decide throw away start scratch. probably create
whole different one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break

supply vitamin D3 K2. offline conversation one time, asked good friend
mine, guest podcast, Eddie Chang, chair neurosurgery,
place top 1% neuroscientists. pulling speech people
completely paralyzed locked-in syndrome, et cetera. asked him,
percentage contained medical textbooks training-- RICK RUBIN:
Today ANDREW HUBERMAN: Today. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. went medical
school today, learned textbook, percentage
information accurate, percentage not? said, maybe half. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Right, asked, consequence that? said,
incalculable, completely agree. asked second time, still came
answer. good sign. Reliability experiment next
good. Yeah. think idea really know things. science,
observed amazing discoveries chance. observed amazing discoveries
incredible bouts hard work. cases, people spending lot time
lab. Like no one walked lab, saw something one day, Nobel Prize
winning discovery fundamental discovery. hanging lab lot. Just


came something didn't expect. Others drilling
toward answer. RICK RUBIN: cases, breakthroughs
happen-- guessing. don't know this-- considering assume information,
discovery true, based everything came it. everything
came wrong, discoveries probably built a-- know
saying? like context, everything happens takes account
context sitting fits context. Maybe context isn't right. knows?
don't know. saying, close things thinking, think
things, lot assumptions go it. new
discoveries essentially built top beliefs, beliefs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: remember-- course, listened Beastie Boys growing up.
didn't? child 90s, the-- Sabotage outgrowth
skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones like girl movies. worlds,
Beastie Boys skateboarding really closely interwoven while. people
know that. people don't. Spike formed bridge, Spike went off
started making bigger movies people watch. just use
example. heard say guys joking around, like
Beastie Boys, like guys hip hop, kind like hardcore scene,
New York, punk rock scene, joke. lot inside jokes.
working together, thought people might love it, might hate it,
just weren't paying attention all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention all.
Never considered it. no-- point time, making
Licensed Ill, hip hop music tiny underground thing. no one making hip hop
time thought ever mean anything. not realistic thought.
making really crazy friends, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think, nowadays, fact one can create something and, quote, unquote,
release quickly. can put something onto Twitter Instagram now.
10 seconds now, will get immediate feedback, external feedback,
course, can iterate basis feedback. think
problematic larger opportunity creativity? words, go back
20 years even 15 years, opportunity create certainly still there,
really didn't know going land you, quote, unquote, released it.
seems opportunity stay magical rainforest
creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: don't think wrong right. just information


can use not use use useful way. can make something
put out, people not like it. like, oh, still don't get it. going
got go harder. Like got go harder direction not-- know
saying? like not react away information. can helpful. can helpful
when-- different stories happen time.
making something, idea is. people engage
it, different idea is. like different reason
dislike reason different reason like it. can't
control things. part can control relate
thing make. external information undermines clarity
connection probably bad art guess. again, saying
experience. try make things-- ever tried make something like
something felt like missing fan wanted, nobody making it.
make it, wasn't-- always service love thing. want
something like this.

00:41:27 Finishing Projects; Source & Nature

No one else making one. make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
beautiful, word keeps coming mind almost like compulsion.
Like options ways behave function work life.
something compulsion, yanks us away opportunities, just
enough get back it. talked about, talk
book, notion source. me, again, can't help put neuroscientist
lens this. think source not one brain area function within
brain, touch bodily signals. Like feels right, doesn't?
like tasting two foods, love example. playbook far
vast short term adaptive playbook, like going get point
point B. yet, listen album song, assume there,
point, becomes not strategy development creativity strategy
implementation. Like needs songs going come order--
don't know much music. musician friends always laughing. RICK RUBIN:
not much music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, ordering
sequence melodies, et cetera. point one decide, OK, like


now's time get narrow focus effort? Like got it. run
this. component creative process involves packaging
finishing. part less satisfying you, just part larger
arc? RICK RUBIN: part same. nice. good feeling.
usually good feeling something done. one hand, commitment,
time say done, can keep experimenting
changing it. think, well, maybe tomorrow can make better, not finished.
keep thinking long time, can forever never put
anything. getting point ready sign off good feeling,
allows you-- one things talk book is, difficult thing
do, fun play, fun maybe not best yet. use
whatever next project going motivation finish one working
now. Like working this. spending time thing. really good.
believe can better, thing really want make.
keep tinkering one, never get make one. using projects
impetus finish something release world good one.
said description source something within us. don't know say
accurate. definitely us too, not us. think source
organizing principle everything, everything exists. trees grow,
mountains. anything can see outside world,
every discovery every piece art every new design every machine
outgrowths source energy. part antenna connects it,
maybe vehicle source allow things happen world. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: thank that, indeed misspeak. recall
distinctly book, described physical world constrained
laws physics certain things. imagination unconstrained. think
right, said work set somewhere those, neither one
other. ultimately feeds imagination way, indeed,
brain physical entity. nature outside world provides least
appears near infinite not infinite options. love example color
palette. restrict whatever sorts paints medium have,
restricted. nature, infinite number shades tones
combinations. RICK RUBIN: even one, pick rock look color
rock tried find paint match rock, never match.


much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different
scales, spatial scales, time scales too, spatial scales, delight comes
nature pictures-- seemed like '80s, like
see drop oil shot high resolution. beauty drop oil.
see Earth galaxy, beauty too, extremes.
course, daily perception

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go
different room, can't see model, paint model, instead of--
changes relationship. not just painting lines. painting
interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

work. talk writing book structure
unique. never encountered book kind structure before,
facile read ever, yet every single page, underlined, took notes, starred. like,
notice, worn, very, worn already time.
process removing functions day last week
going order get access this-- going think now

comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works

far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project

amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook

before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one

passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines

something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.

everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people

red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,

completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science

editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,

sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now

acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,

something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk

OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting

wanting get bad critters body can't handle it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Like get here. RICK RUBIN: trying convince you,
inside, get out. Maybe feeling compelled get
comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Elon getting us Mars might bit of--
maybe just want get Mars. RICK RUBIN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: starting feel like channeling Lex Freedman
moment. No, think considering opposite really key. might sound
mystical people little bit like just playing ideas, exactly
science. Someone walks result says, found this. true.
say, something else? good example might be-- pulling
podcast episodes had. Alia Crum amazing psychologist
works belief effects. knowledge strongly shapes physiological outcome.
amazing graduate thesis said, exercise placebo,
it? Yeah, burn calories things. Turns isn't case.
turns lot effects exercise, positive effects-- lowering blood pressure,
relieving stress, positive placebo nobody thinks like
attached calories burned, et cetera. RICK RUBIN: think big point
belief part huge part conversation everything. believe
power. believe can make something great, chances us making something
great better don't believe can. say, ability harness
belief behalf really healthy thing do. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one thing make clear abilities may come question
time time, absolutely believe elements create
there. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely. elements here. Everything here. get
pick choose. get to-- conveyor belts going little gifts. can-
- first, notice conveyor belt. notice gifts.
starting point. may even feel empowered enough grab one
gifts, open up, see inside. maybe started something
really beautiful wouldn't done. Everything make made
always based something see

02:46:25 Attention, Emotion & Art



hear allows see something didn't see before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going ask whether not, important happy order create,
certainly lot people unhappy still able create.
listen you, seems really ability pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: unhappy happy may not relevant
whether not able stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. say that's--
say able stay present work probably important part it.
feel less issue unless feel gets way feeling
work makes feel. know saying? lot pain
looking piece art, may hard know art makes feel
you're-- big signal body physical pain. sure
people can too, can, even physical pain, can feel it.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, idea transmutation, taking one emotion
contorting co-opting another action adaptive way. idea
distraction problem, really resonates, think. think times great
productivity able undistracted. also see success can
distraction. often discussed context fighting sports,
someone starts making lot money pretty soon focus becomes things
can access success opposed

02:48:07 Mantra Meditation, Awareness Meditation

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either
engaging mantra, version almost creating trance
ourselves, not unlike listening something go sleep distract


conscious mind participating. overriding talking mind just
sound generating, word, phrase, series phrases. Meta meditation
loving kindness meditation phrases, focused
breath. purpose focused breath not hear self-talk
normally have. single pointed focus exercise described.
version awareness meditation, closing eyes.
whatever noticing-- now, eyes open
eyes closed awareness practice. first thing
feel-- feel little ringing ears. might electronic equipment around
us. don't mean hear sound. like vibration. hear cars passing
distance. see else comes out, can feel feeling chest. can feel
part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.
cases, example awareness meditation, mantra
meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince
give us suggestions one two can link listeners. sure
appreciate. RICK RUBIN: also meditation like practices
involve-- something called surgical series Monroe Institute
used surgery. listen recording. allows body
heal much faster remove trauma goes getting cut open--
traumatic. just listening certain things, can really powerful
effect, heal much faster. remember put surgery.
eyes closed. wasn't communicating anyone going
inside. wife me. came in. said, oh, already
gave Rick sedative ready go in. don't think gave anything.
like, look numbers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. Yeah, amazingly
powerful practice like anyone can cultivate. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely,
absolutely. no good bad version. really just-- learn technique
show it, works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, love
willing share process. Listen, just want say thank
number things. want thank music created
create want still ongoing, certainly time today sharing
thought process bit goes incredible creative process. want
thank writing book. don't talk feature many books
podcast. just not something typically do, seen little bit evolution
it. seen now read final form twice, mentioned.
going continue read again. one books
filled gems, like every chapter. take notes this. take notes this.
assembled digestible way allows people extract meaningful
parts every chapter. many way straightforward.
love book. thank certainly didn't write


book. happy did. know already benefited know
many people going benefit. amazing book. couldn't help put
neuroscience lens it. also, halfway through, learned discard pre-
existing lens bit start see things think different perspective.
just want thank incredible portal also
amazing friend. RICK RUBIN: Thank you. love you. happy you.

00:08:23 Creativity & Ideas, Cloud Analogy

spelled O-U-S, livemomentous.com/huberman. now discussion Rick
Rubin. Great today, Rick. RICK RUBIN: Thank me.
pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: topics science, particular
neuroscience, confess creativity difficult one capture.
can find papers, scientific studies is, convergent thinking versus divergent
thinking, definitions these, take different forms.
strict definition form, seems creativity something either rearranging
existing elements coming new elements. went book,
done twice. read twice, way, feel blessed honored
gotten early copy you, final copy early is. gone
twice, now convinced may not actually internal source creativity
exists right. example give that, me, really serving
anchor, tell wrong here, idea ideas creativity
little bit like cloud. look one moment, might think looks like one
thing, certain shape texture. look moment later,
quite bit different. look hour later, well gone.
reason think serves powerful hook think
creativity think neuroscientists scientists general never actually
captured way even talk creativity stems somebody knew
person but, know, greatly admire. don't many heroes, put Joe
Strummer among short list heroes have. remember interview
fairly disjointed. off different tangents couldn't follow. one
point, just blurted that, idea, write down.
may end throwing away, wait, will gone. remember that,
consequence, whole system use try capture ideas.
thoughts Joe said, cloud idea comes one form one area
book? think thread throughout book different ways.
come you, serve trying to-- don't want say extract--
trying access creativity? RICK RUBIN: think best way think like
dream. like, think dreams, don't necessarily make sense.
wake up, might remember part not whole thing. Then, start
writing down, come back, may not make sense you. There'll


series abstract images, maybe, someday future, able look back
understand mean, maybe not. art making process
works like making things, looking feeling ourselves.
feeling excitement enthusiasm, feeling interest, feeling curiosity--
want know more-- feeling leaning forward. following energy
body, feel something here. something here. want know
more. want know more. want know more. say, not intellectual process.

00:12:26 Language & Creativity; Kids

different thing. hard even talk it, elusive.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Recently, listening podcast friend Lex
Fridman. think episode Balaji Srinivasan, Balaji, investor-
type guy, thinker-type guy-- like eight-hour episode. says something
beginning love thoughts on. said, look, can train rat lever press
every time expect reward every even number press every odd number
press even every fifth number press. human rat can't like prime
number presses. can't actually train that. think reward
systems way follow life, get go sleep,
said fact can't means may not actually touch
best schedules things. Like every time thirsty, take sip. assume
right way it, might not optimal, whatever purpose.
reading book, thinking set things follow, things
pay attention to-- talk this-- things access, none creative process
comes just within us. can, always fed things outside it.
started is, second time read book, think
lens Balaji saying may not even language
thing call accessing creativity. process, language
form words little bit like trying use even numbers try access prime
numbers. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like math becomes
convoluted end conversation like this, confident can get
kernels it. remarkable book do. show
inform process. may not English language
saying, this, this, this, this, something creative


value. capture it? RICK RUBIN: Yes. think language insufficient drill
creativity. closer magic science. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
kids come world, think better access creative
process adults? start impart rule plays books. Like will
get likes? Will people like it? also things available us
not paying attention to, like texture table, discarding things,
systematically. get, quote, unquote, set ways. think kids are, just
definition design, creative adults? RICK RUBIN: Yes. Kids,
open, no baggage. don't belief system. don't know
things supposed work. just see is, pay attention
is, learn much we-- us select endless number data
points available us to, well, species, make sure don't die
procreate feed probably primary functions first.
learn things right wrong, learn things
certain things. inspired someone makes something love,
want way it. things undermine purity
creative process. can tools build skill set able yourself. Like
singer, might imitate singer really like get good
eventually come find voice. doesn't always start
voice. three years old five years old, try singing, not
singing like anyone else. singing voice. make
something, making based not knowing. think advantage, early
career, starting making music without experience, helpful,
didn't know rules breaking. wasn't intentional breaking
rules. just seemed right me,

00:17:36 Feelings & Creative Ideas

didn't realize things people wouldn't do. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: idea no new ideas. disagree, every
while, see hear something least seems different enough. RICK
RUBIN: think combination of-- new combination existing ideas presented
new way. think works. don't know. will say, seem like
things interesting series familiar elements joined together


way creating something never seen before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned close see hints creativity real
value feeling, also believe body great source information.
people will realize brain, course, skull, nervous
system extends everywhere body, whole mind-body thing just falls away.
Philosophers argued forever, silly argument. also true that,
God forbid, amputate limbs, amputated, fundamentally still
me. Right? not true took big enough chunk brain,
still survived. fundamentally different human being. still
name identity social security number, behave differently.
knows, maybe better? signals body know, least assume,
pretty generic. Like can think 50 different ways 100 ways talk
creativity today. define redefine carve serve like
sushi bunch different ways. body sends signals us are--
course understanding of. like, oh, stomach hurts, stomach feels
good, not sensing stomach. oh, feels good. feels warm. feels cold.
Like us aren't trained understanding interpret signals.
almost like vowels, syllables, isn't lot more. Whereas,
talk thoughts experiences, depending hyper verbal
somebody much emphasis put different sounds, near infinite. Not
infinite, near infinite. personally, know end
thread creativity-- maybe listening artist, hearing something.
like antennae start deflect certain way. Right?
feel body recognizable sensation, thought
sensation? RICK RUBIN: feeling body. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
localized? RICK RUBIN: No. feeling of-- say like surge energy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: remember first time experienced that? RICK
RUBIN: Probably hearing Beatles, three four years old. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Three four years old? RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wow. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: something wrong
Beatles never done me? RICK RUBIN: No. Maybe just weren't
exposed right time right way. no right wrong way, everyone--
can love Beatles, can not, right. not-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: glad can still friends. little concerned. little


scared ask question. know taste music little bit obscure
fragmentary, good. always felt like, gosh, must something wrong
me. like songs, don't-- no juice there. RICK RUBIN: think
maybe watch-- eight-part series called Beatles Anthology,
print. can try find somewhere, can watch together,
maybe that'll make case Beatles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Nothing
them, just always bothering story, like Ramones. saw that,
like, wow, like jeans, aviators, everyone change last name
Ramone, lot hated other. much drama there, three
chords just-- me, just like, wow, like kids New York, energy.

00:22:01 Rules, Choice & Art; Personal Taste & Other’s Opinions

think different things different people. Right? RICK RUBIN: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings question something feels
creatively right, sensing it, there, say studio maybe
even listening something somebody sent you, translate that,
given absence language? translate conversation
artist? again, writing comedy science podcasting,
matter. say that, keep going way, might not even
recognize it? guessing lot times, don't. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. Sometimes, don't. depends. the-- try setting
where, talking it, can engage moment. not much
good. say producing new record, played something,
thoughts it. wouldn't helpful tell were.
It'd better us wait till place try things see
goes. first thing wouldn't rely language it.
making suggestion something actionable. try it,
data. either moving good direction, moving away from--
moving towards away it, never know. always experiment.
maybe simple way talk like, gave two dishes food
asked taste tell one like better. Usually, pretty
straightforward, two choices, like better, think
creativity can boiled that. different wonder going


perform certain social media platforms? different it--
tasting two things, one want finish eating? say,
like one better, needs little salt, put little salt it. like, maybe
put much salt, know taste it. like simple. tune
enough really know feel face knowing
people might feel differently, part challenge. like, everyone tells
A, A, A, A, A, A, listen, like B, artist, important
able say, me, B. disconnect, much of, go
school, get us follow rules. art, different, rules
scaffolding chipped away, need be. Sometimes, helpful.
Sometimes, not, sometimes, even impose rules give
something shape. can decide make a-- going make painting,
going use green red colors allowed use.
decide advance, solve problem knowing
green red? can-- otherwise, infinite number choices,
anything can anything. like, sometimes choices not better. limiting
palate something manageable forces solve problems different way. Now,
digital age music-wise, can make anything digitally. no--
time when, didn't guitar studio, couldn't record guitar.
couldn't hire orchestra, couldn't orchestra recording. Now, can
just call things up. infinite choices, infinite choices don't
necessarily lead better compositions better final works. Understanding feel
face voices, without second guessing yourself, probably single
important thing practice artist. skill set develop artist know
feel, feelings. key not know, know
right you. doesn't work way. just know me, reason chose
artist demonstrate see it. undermining taste
commercial idea, defeats whole purpose this. not process
about. process me, showing am. can like
not, either way, still see it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that,
science, trained graduate students, graduate student,
blessed mentors, one real iconoclast. dead now.
Actually, advisors dead-- suicide, cancer, cancer. joke don't want
work you. morbid sense humor, laughing


this, someplace, right now. RICK RUBIN: thought going say ate
poison mushrooms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, last one said me,
common denominator, Andrew. thought, oh goodness, said, kind just
kidding, not really. little bit eerie. case, always said-- name
Ben-- always said, one thing can't teach taste, one predictor
people will never develop ones perfectionists.
filtering their-- perfectionists filter perfection
feedback others. always looking person putting little bit
middle finger feedback. Not much get things wrong,
can badly wrong science. can wrong right reasons, can also
wrong wrong reasons. people just almost compulsion
way believe doing. hearing that,
hearing describing. also think something
human empathic process emotional process, see somebody
something seem really not paying attention anyone else
doing-- guess crazy person street one version it, go
just experience, just crazy. somebody seems enjoying
emotion seems real, think good fraction people
feel gravitational pull, go, yeah, that. best example
remember growing skateboard thing first-- first
start baggy, sagging clothes thing, got teased endlessly one year
school. Then, bunch hip hop came out, guys wearing
sagging jeans shorts. Next year, come back, people
making fun us it, clicked me. like,
people don't actually know like. RICK RUBIN: No.

00:30:20 Changing Perspective & Creativity

ANDREW HUBERMAN: like like certainty people
like. question is, landscape creative stuff, real?
not real? almost like whoever can create convincing story least
captures good number of-- good fraction audiences, not
creative artist needs do. need actually depart that. right?
RICK RUBIN: Well just two different things. Like coming story


purpose pleasing someone else skill set, commercial endeavor
artistic endeavor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like tactical. Yeah. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
thinking, book, describe, again, thinking creative
process cloud, me, again, serves powerful anchor. think
biology, neurobiology, like strategy formation strategy implementation
almost sheer luck, miraculously, turn pages later book,
description animals trying accomplish something-- eat,
mate, find water, accomplish requirements living-- requires narrow visual
focus. something lab obsessed with, obsessed with.
narrow visual focus, know playbook becomes narrow.
rule set narrow. Now, point, order come new creative
idea, means broadening vision essential, way, broadening
thinking. RICK RUBIN: Well, either broadening narrowing,
changing aperture standard. reason present something
new maybe already knew didn't know knew it.
case, looking it. not unlike comedian does. Comedian
makes laugh. Usually, saying, outrageous, know
right. Just no one says way, no one said way before. always
truth makes funny. like that. idea recognizing
something seems really obvious, see it, seems like nobody else sees
it, no one else points out. feel like science like too, much
science, light flashes head, like got it, just seems like, well,
knew forever. No one knew it, know saying? like
obvious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN: obvious. think
another superpower artists accepting don't know anything. think
know things, also limits world. think know like this.
possible, nice little box. reality, say case?
say the-- take believe science now

00:33:55 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

decide throw away start scratch. probably create
whole different one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break

mine, guest podcast, Eddie Chang, chair neurosurgery,
place top 1% neuroscientists. pulling speech people
completely paralyzed locked-in syndrome, et cetera. asked him,
percentage contained medical textbooks training-- RICK RUBIN:
Today ANDREW HUBERMAN: Today. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. went medical
school today, learned textbook, percentage
information accurate, percentage not? said, maybe half. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Right, asked, consequence that? said,
incalculable, completely agree. asked second time, still came
answer. good sign. Reliability experiment next
good. Yeah. think idea really know things. science,
observed amazing discoveries chance. observed amazing discoveries
incredible bouts hard work. cases, people spending lot time
lab. Like no one walked lab, saw something one day, Nobel Prize
winning discovery fundamental discovery. hanging lab lot. Just


came something didn't expect. Others drilling
toward answer. RICK RUBIN: cases, breakthroughs
happen-- guessing. don't know this-- considering assume information,
discovery true, based everything came it. everything
came wrong, discoveries probably built a-- know
saying? like context, everything happens takes account
context sitting fits context. Maybe context isn't right. knows?
don't know. saying, close things thinking, think
things, lot assumptions go it. new
discoveries essentially built top beliefs, beliefs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: remember-- course, listened Beastie Boys growing up.
didn't? child 90s, the-- Sabotage outgrowth
skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones like girl movies. worlds,
Beastie Boys skateboarding really closely interwoven while. people
know that. people don't. Spike formed bridge, Spike went off
started making bigger movies people watch. just use
example. heard say guys joking around, like
Beastie Boys, like guys hip hop, kind like hardcore scene,
New York, punk rock scene, joke. lot inside jokes.
working together, thought people might love it, might hate it,
just weren't paying attention all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention all.
Never considered it. no-- point time, making
Licensed Ill, hip hop music tiny underground thing. no one making hip hop
time thought ever mean anything. not realistic thought.
making really crazy friends, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think, nowadays, fact one can create something and, quote, unquote,
release quickly. can put something onto Twitter Instagram now.
10 seconds now, will get immediate feedback, external feedback,
course, can iterate basis feedback. think
problematic larger opportunity creativity? words, go back
20 years even 15 years, opportunity create certainly still there,
really didn't know going land you, quote, unquote, released it.
seems opportunity stay magical rainforest
creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: don't think wrong right. just information


can use not use use useful way. can make something
put out, people not like it. like, oh, still don't get it. going
got go harder. Like got go harder direction not-- know
saying? like not react away information. can helpful. can helpful
when-- different stories happen time.
making something, idea is. people engage
it, different idea is. like different reason
dislike reason different reason like it. can't
control things. part can control relate
thing make. external information undermines clarity
connection probably bad art guess. again, saying
experience. try make things-- ever tried make something like
something felt like missing fan wanted, nobody making it.
make it, wasn't-- always service love thing. want
something like this.

00:41:27 Finishing Projects; Source & Nature

No one else making one. make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
beautiful, word keeps coming mind almost like compulsion.
Like options ways behave function work life.
something compulsion, yanks us away opportunities, just
enough get back it. talked about, talk
book, notion source. me, again, can't help put neuroscientist
lens this. think source not one brain area function within
brain, touch bodily signals. Like feels right, doesn't?
like tasting two foods, love example. playbook far
vast short term adaptive playbook, like going get point
point B. yet, listen album song, assume there,
point, becomes not strategy development creativity strategy
implementation. Like needs songs going come order--
don't know much music. musician friends always laughing. RICK RUBIN:
not much music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, ordering
sequence melodies, et cetera. point one decide, OK, like


now's time get narrow focus effort? Like got it. run
this. component creative process involves packaging
finishing. part less satisfying you, just part larger
arc? RICK RUBIN: part same. nice. good feeling.
usually good feeling something done. one hand, commitment,
time say done, can keep experimenting
changing it. think, well, maybe tomorrow can make better, not finished.
keep thinking long time, can forever never put
anything. getting point ready sign off good feeling,
allows you-- one things talk book is, difficult thing
do, fun play, fun maybe not best yet. use
whatever next project going motivation finish one working
now. Like working this. spending time thing. really good.
believe can better, thing really want make.
keep tinkering one, never get make one. using projects
impetus finish something release world good one.
said description source something within us. don't know say
accurate. definitely us too, not us. think source
organizing principle everything, everything exists. trees grow,
mountains. anything can see outside world,
every discovery every piece art every new design every machine
outgrowths source energy. part antenna connects it,
maybe vehicle source allow things happen world. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: thank that, indeed misspeak. recall
distinctly book, described physical world constrained
laws physics certain things. imagination unconstrained. think
right, said work set somewhere those, neither one
other. ultimately feeds imagination way, indeed,
brain physical entity. nature outside world provides least
appears near infinite not infinite options. love example color
palette. restrict whatever sorts paints medium have,
restricted. nature, infinite number shades tones
combinations. RICK RUBIN: even one, pick rock look color
rock tried find paint match rock, never match.


much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different
scales, spatial scales, time scales too, spatial scales, delight comes
nature pictures-- seemed like '80s, like
see drop oil shot high resolution. beauty drop oil.
see Earth galaxy, beauty too, extremes.
course, daily perception

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go
different room, can't see model, paint model, instead of--
changes relationship. not just painting lines. painting
interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

work. talk writing book structure
unique. never encountered book kind structure before,
facile read ever, yet every single page, underlined, took notes, starred. like,
notice, worn, very, worn already time.
process removing functions day last week
going order get access this-- going think now
receiver inside you. Right? Almost like tuning radio, [IMITATING STATIC]
comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works
progress spend time listening day looking ideas. stay
far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:
think relationship music, relationship love. didn't listen
get angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: listened
loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: felt loved it,

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.

passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat

elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines

something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.

everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,

completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,

sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now

something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.

OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting

Strummer said? actually wrote wall laboratory. No input no


output. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Strummer's law. written
laboratory. people lab like, going here? think one guy
knew was, picture him, picture bull dog, no input
no output. don't think can just stay room four walls, ceiling, nothing
else create. mean, know certain number things here,
think accessing world important. RICK RUBIN: world giving us clues
time. paying attention, another part it. paying attention,
thing looking either whispered screamed outside
world paying attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, forget exact title
chapter, chapter staying open clues lookout
clues. Now, feel tempted look exact title chapter. RICK RUBIN:
probably look clues guess. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look clues sounds
like sounds right. since wrote it, guessing right. RICK RUBIN: Well
something like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think clues
everywhere? RICK RUBIN: Yes, think clues everywhere. pay attention,
hear phrase. It'll trigger thought. see something unexpected. someone
recommends something you, maybe coincidence. three people recommend
thing maybe not, knows? knows? believe universe
side creativity. universe supporting things happen. can
happen happen someone else. paying
attention, maybe it'll happen you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: guest
podcast named Justin Sonnenburg. expert gut microbiome.
applied something that-- without knowing, applied opposite principle, opposite
true principle. talking trillions gut microbiota clearly
amazing things create, neurotransmitters, govern brain, even
decision making, much sugar system driving appetite, et cetera.
said, think cargo, maybe just vehicles charge.
interactions like every time shake hands touch eyes,
exchanging gut microbiota. think intelligence thinking intelligence.
microbiologist. seriousness said, maybe ones
manipulated. house cats. think are, falling love,
kissing, shaking hands, washing hands, sorts things isolate
connect one another. maybe gut microbiota really trying optimize
survival. RICK RUBIN: Laird Hamilton said one point


sauna-- sauna, really hot. feeling
wanting get bad critters body can't handle it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Like get here. RICK RUBIN: trying convince you,
inside, get out. Maybe feeling compelled get
comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Elon getting us Mars might bit of--
maybe just want get Mars. RICK RUBIN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: starting feel like channeling Lex Freedman
moment. No, think considering opposite really key. might sound
mystical people little bit like just playing ideas, exactly
science. Someone walks result says, found this. true.
say, something else? good example might be-- pulling
podcast episodes had. Alia Crum amazing psychologist
works belief effects. knowledge strongly shapes physiological outcome.
amazing graduate thesis said, exercise placebo,
it? Yeah, burn calories things. Turns isn't case.
turns lot effects exercise, positive effects-- lowering blood pressure,
relieving stress, positive placebo nobody thinks like
attached calories burned, et cetera. RICK RUBIN: think big point
belief part huge part conversation everything. believe
power. believe can make something great, chances us making something
great better don't believe can. say, ability harness
belief behalf really healthy thing do. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one thing make clear abilities may come question
time time, absolutely believe elements create
there. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely. elements here. Everything here. get
pick choose. get to-- conveyor belts going little gifts. can-
- first, notice conveyor belt. notice gifts.
starting point. may even feel empowered enough grab one
gifts, open up, see inside. maybe started something
really beautiful wouldn't done. Everything make made
always based something see

02:46:25 Attention, Emotion & Art



hear allows see something didn't see before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going ask whether not, important happy order create,
certainly lot people unhappy still able create.
listen you, seems really ability pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: unhappy happy may not relevant
whether not able stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. say that's--
say able stay present work probably important part it.
feel less issue unless feel gets way feeling
work makes feel. know saying? lot pain
looking piece art, may hard know art makes feel
you're-- big signal body physical pain. sure
people can too, can, even physical pain, can feel it.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, idea transmutation, taking one emotion
contorting co-opting another action adaptive way. idea
distraction problem, really resonates, think. think times great
productivity able undistracted. also see success can
distraction. often discussed context fighting sports,
someone starts making lot money pretty soon focus becomes things
can access success opposed

02:48:07 Mantra Meditation, Awareness Meditation

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either
engaging mantra, version almost creating trance
ourselves, not unlike listening something go sleep distract


conscious mind participating. overriding talking mind just
sound generating, word, phrase, series phrases. Meta meditation
loving kindness meditation phrases, focused
breath. purpose focused breath not hear self-talk
normally have. single pointed focus exercise described.
version awareness meditation, closing eyes.
whatever noticing-- now, eyes open
eyes closed awareness practice. first thing
feel-- feel little ringing ears. might electronic equipment around
us. don't mean hear sound. like vibration. hear cars passing
distance. see else comes out, can feel feeling chest. can feel
part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.
cases, example awareness meditation, mantra
meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince
give us suggestions one two can link listeners. sure
appreciate. RICK RUBIN: also meditation like practices
involve-- something called surgical series Monroe Institute
used surgery. listen recording. allows body
heal much faster remove trauma goes getting cut open--
traumatic. just listening certain things, can really powerful
effect, heal much faster. remember put surgery.
eyes closed. wasn't communicating anyone going
inside. wife me. came in. said, oh, already
gave Rick sedative ready go in. don't think gave anything.
like, look numbers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. Yeah, amazingly
powerful practice like anyone can cultivate. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely,
absolutely. no good bad version. really just-- learn technique
show it, works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, love
willing share process. Listen, just want say thank
number things. want thank music created
create want still ongoing, certainly time today sharing
thought process bit goes incredible creative process. want
thank writing book. don't talk feature many books
podcast. just not something typically do, seen little bit evolution
it. seen now read final form twice, mentioned.
going continue read again. one books
filled gems, like every chapter. take notes this. take notes this.
assembled digestible way allows people extract meaningful
parts every chapter. many way straightforward.
love book. thank certainly didn't write


book. happy did. know already benefited know
many people going benefit. amazing book. couldn't help put
neuroscience lens it. also, halfway through, learned discard pre-
existing lens bit start see things think different perspective.
just want thank incredible portal also
amazing friend. RICK RUBIN: Thank you. love you. happy you.

series abstract images, maybe, someday future, able look back
understand mean, maybe not. art making process
works like making things, looking feeling ourselves.
feeling excitement enthusiasm, feeling interest, feeling curiosity--
want know more-- feeling leaning forward. following energy
body, feel something here. something here. want know
more. want know more. want know more. say, not intellectual process.

00:12:26 Language & Creativity; Kids

different thing. hard even talk it, elusive.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Recently, listening podcast friend Lex
Fridman. think episode Balaji Srinivasan, Balaji, investor-
type guy, thinker-type guy-- like eight-hour episode. says something
beginning love thoughts on. said, look, can train rat lever press
every time expect reward every even number press every odd number
press even every fifth number press. human rat can't like prime
number presses. can't actually train that. think reward
systems way follow life, get go sleep,
said fact can't means may not actually touch
best schedules things. Like every time thirsty, take sip. assume
right way it, might not optimal, whatever purpose.
reading book, thinking set things follow, things
pay attention to-- talk this-- things access, none creative process
comes just within us. can, always fed things outside it.
started is, second time read book, think
lens Balaji saying may not even language
thing call accessing creativity. process, language
form words little bit like trying use even numbers try access prime
numbers. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like math becomes
convoluted end conversation like this, confident can get
kernels it. remarkable book do. show
inform process. may not English language
saying, this, this, this, this, something creative


value. capture it? RICK RUBIN: Yes. think language insufficient drill
creativity. closer magic science. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
kids come world, think better access creative
process adults? start impart rule plays books. Like will
get likes? Will people like it? also things available us
not paying attention to, like texture table, discarding things,
systematically. get, quote, unquote, set ways. think kids are, just
definition design, creative adults? RICK RUBIN: Yes. Kids,
open, no baggage. don't belief system. don't know
things supposed work. just see is, pay attention
is, learn much we-- us select endless number data
points available us to, well, species, make sure don't die
procreate feed probably primary functions first.
learn things right wrong, learn things
certain things. inspired someone makes something love,
want way it. things undermine purity
creative process. can tools build skill set able yourself. Like
singer, might imitate singer really like get good
eventually come find voice. doesn't always start
voice. three years old five years old, try singing, not
singing like anyone else. singing voice. make
something, making based not knowing. think advantage, early
career, starting making music without experience, helpful,
didn't know rules breaking. wasn't intentional breaking
rules. just seemed right me,

00:17:36 Feelings & Creative Ideas

didn't realize things people wouldn't do. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: idea no new ideas. disagree, every
while, see hear something least seems different enough. RICK
RUBIN: think combination of-- new combination existing ideas presented
new way. think works. don't know. will say, seem like
things interesting series familiar elements joined together


way creating something never seen before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned close see hints creativity real
value feeling, also believe body great source information.
people will realize brain, course, skull, nervous
system extends everywhere body, whole mind-body thing just falls away.
Philosophers argued forever, silly argument. also true that,
God forbid, amputate limbs, amputated, fundamentally still
me. Right? not true took big enough chunk brain,
still survived. fundamentally different human being. still
name identity social security number, behave differently.
knows, maybe better? signals body know, least assume,
pretty generic. Like can think 50 different ways 100 ways talk
creativity today. define redefine carve serve like
sushi bunch different ways. body sends signals us are--
course understanding of. like, oh, stomach hurts, stomach feels
good, not sensing stomach. oh, feels good. feels warm. feels cold.
Like us aren't trained understanding interpret signals.
almost like vowels, syllables, isn't lot more. Whereas,
talk thoughts experiences, depending hyper verbal
somebody much emphasis put different sounds, near infinite. Not
infinite, near infinite. personally, know end
thread creativity-- maybe listening artist, hearing something.
like antennae start deflect certain way. Right?
feel body recognizable sensation, thought
sensation? RICK RUBIN: feeling body. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
localized? RICK RUBIN: No. feeling of-- say like surge energy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: remember first time experienced that? RICK
RUBIN: Probably hearing Beatles, three four years old. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Three four years old? RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wow. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: something wrong
Beatles never done me? RICK RUBIN: No. Maybe just weren't
exposed right time right way. no right wrong way, everyone--
can love Beatles, can not, right. not-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: glad can still friends. little concerned. little


scared ask question. know taste music little bit obscure
fragmentary, good. always felt like, gosh, must something wrong
me. like songs, don't-- no juice there. RICK RUBIN: think
maybe watch-- eight-part series called Beatles Anthology,
print. can try find somewhere, can watch together,
maybe that'll make case Beatles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Nothing
them, just always bothering story, like Ramones. saw that,
like, wow, like jeans, aviators, everyone change last name
Ramone, lot hated other. much drama there, three
chords just-- me, just like, wow, like kids New York, energy.

00:22:01 Rules, Choice & Art; Personal Taste & Other’s Opinions

think different things different people. Right? RICK RUBIN: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings question something feels
creatively right, sensing it, there, say studio maybe
even listening something somebody sent you, translate that,
given absence language? translate conversation
artist? again, writing comedy science podcasting,
matter. say that, keep going way, might not even
recognize it? guessing lot times, don't. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. Sometimes, don't. depends. the-- try setting
where, talking it, can engage moment. not much
good. say producing new record, played something,
thoughts it. wouldn't helpful tell were.
It'd better us wait till place try things see
goes. first thing wouldn't rely language it.
making suggestion something actionable. try it,
data. either moving good direction, moving away from--
moving towards away it, never know. always experiment.
maybe simple way talk like, gave two dishes food
asked taste tell one like better. Usually, pretty
straightforward, two choices, like better, think
creativity can boiled that. different wonder going


perform certain social media platforms? different it--
tasting two things, one want finish eating? say,
like one better, needs little salt, put little salt it. like, maybe
put much salt, know taste it. like simple. tune
enough really know feel face knowing
people might feel differently, part challenge. like, everyone tells
A, A, A, A, A, A, listen, like B, artist, important
able say, me, B. disconnect, much of, go
school, get us follow rules. art, different, rules
scaffolding chipped away, need be. Sometimes, helpful.
Sometimes, not, sometimes, even impose rules give
something shape. can decide make a-- going make painting,
going use green red colors allowed use.
decide advance, solve problem knowing
green red? can-- otherwise, infinite number choices,
anything can anything. like, sometimes choices not better. limiting
palate something manageable forces solve problems different way. Now,
digital age music-wise, can make anything digitally. no--
time when, didn't guitar studio, couldn't record guitar.
couldn't hire orchestra, couldn't orchestra recording. Now, can
just call things up. infinite choices, infinite choices don't
necessarily lead better compositions better final works. Understanding feel
face voices, without second guessing yourself, probably single
important thing practice artist. skill set develop artist know
feel, feelings. key not know, know
right you. doesn't work way. just know me, reason chose
artist demonstrate see it. undermining taste
commercial idea, defeats whole purpose this. not process
about. process me, showing am. can like
not, either way, still see it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that,
science, trained graduate students, graduate student,
blessed mentors, one real iconoclast. dead now.
Actually, advisors dead-- suicide, cancer, cancer. joke don't want
work you. morbid sense humor, laughing


this, someplace, right now. RICK RUBIN: thought going say ate
poison mushrooms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, last one said me,
common denominator, Andrew. thought, oh goodness, said, kind just
kidding, not really. little bit eerie. case, always said-- name
Ben-- always said, one thing can't teach taste, one predictor
people will never develop ones perfectionists.
filtering their-- perfectionists filter perfection
feedback others. always looking person putting little bit
middle finger feedback. Not much get things wrong,
can badly wrong science. can wrong right reasons, can also
wrong wrong reasons. people just almost compulsion
way believe doing. hearing that,
hearing describing. also think something
human empathic process emotional process, see somebody
something seem really not paying attention anyone else
doing-- guess crazy person street one version it, go
just experience, just crazy. somebody seems enjoying
emotion seems real, think good fraction people
feel gravitational pull, go, yeah, that. best example
remember growing skateboard thing first-- first
start baggy, sagging clothes thing, got teased endlessly one year
school. Then, bunch hip hop came out, guys wearing
sagging jeans shorts. Next year, come back, people
making fun us it, clicked me. like,
people don't actually know like. RICK RUBIN: No.

00:30:20 Changing Perspective & Creativity

ANDREW HUBERMAN: like like certainty people
like. question is, landscape creative stuff, real?
not real? almost like whoever can create convincing story least
captures good number of-- good fraction audiences, not
creative artist needs do. need actually depart that. right?
RICK RUBIN: Well just two different things. Like coming story


purpose pleasing someone else skill set, commercial endeavor
artistic endeavor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like tactical. Yeah. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
thinking, book, describe, again, thinking creative
process cloud, me, again, serves powerful anchor. think
biology, neurobiology, like strategy formation strategy implementation
almost sheer luck, miraculously, turn pages later book,
description animals trying accomplish something-- eat,
mate, find water, accomplish requirements living-- requires narrow visual
focus. something lab obsessed with, obsessed with.
narrow visual focus, know playbook becomes narrow.
rule set narrow. Now, point, order come new creative
idea, means broadening vision essential, way, broadening
thinking. RICK RUBIN: Well, either broadening narrowing,
changing aperture standard. reason present something
new maybe already knew didn't know knew it.
case, looking it. not unlike comedian does. Comedian
makes laugh. Usually, saying, outrageous, know
right. Just no one says way, no one said way before. always
truth makes funny. like that. idea recognizing
something seems really obvious, see it, seems like nobody else sees
it, no one else points out. feel like science like too, much
science, light flashes head, like got it, just seems like, well,
knew forever. No one knew it, know saying? like
obvious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN: obvious. think
another superpower artists accepting don't know anything. think
know things, also limits world. think know like this.
possible, nice little box. reality, say case?
say the-- take believe science now

00:33:55 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

decide throw away start scratch. probably create
whole different one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break

supply vitamin D3 K2. offline conversation one time, asked good friend
mine, guest podcast, Eddie Chang, chair neurosurgery,
place top 1% neuroscientists. pulling speech people
completely paralyzed locked-in syndrome, et cetera. asked him,
percentage contained medical textbooks training-- RICK RUBIN:
Today ANDREW HUBERMAN: Today. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. went medical
school today, learned textbook, percentage
information accurate, percentage not? said, maybe half. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Right, asked, consequence that? said,
incalculable, completely agree. asked second time, still came
answer. good sign. Reliability experiment next
good. Yeah. think idea really know things. science,
observed amazing discoveries chance. observed amazing discoveries
incredible bouts hard work. cases, people spending lot time
lab. Like no one walked lab, saw something one day, Nobel Prize
winning discovery fundamental discovery. hanging lab lot. Just


came something didn't expect. Others drilling
toward answer. RICK RUBIN: cases, breakthroughs
happen-- guessing. don't know this-- considering assume information,
discovery true, based everything came it. everything
came wrong, discoveries probably built a-- know
saying? like context, everything happens takes account
context sitting fits context. Maybe context isn't right. knows?
don't know. saying, close things thinking, think
things, lot assumptions go it. new
discoveries essentially built top beliefs, beliefs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: remember-- course, listened Beastie Boys growing up.
didn't? child 90s, the-- Sabotage outgrowth
skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones like girl movies. worlds,
Beastie Boys skateboarding really closely interwoven while. people
know that. people don't. Spike formed bridge, Spike went off
started making bigger movies people watch. just use
example. heard say guys joking around, like
Beastie Boys, like guys hip hop, kind like hardcore scene,
New York, punk rock scene, joke. lot inside jokes.
working together, thought people might love it, might hate it,
just weren't paying attention all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention all.
Never considered it. no-- point time, making
Licensed Ill, hip hop music tiny underground thing. no one making hip hop
time thought ever mean anything. not realistic thought.
making really crazy friends, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think, nowadays, fact one can create something and, quote, unquote,
release quickly. can put something onto Twitter Instagram now.
10 seconds now, will get immediate feedback, external feedback,
course, can iterate basis feedback. think
problematic larger opportunity creativity? words, go back
20 years even 15 years, opportunity create certainly still there,
really didn't know going land you, quote, unquote, released it.
seems opportunity stay magical rainforest
creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: don't think wrong right. just information


can use not use use useful way. can make something
put out, people not like it. like, oh, still don't get it. going
got go harder. Like got go harder direction not-- know
saying? like not react away information. can helpful. can helpful
when-- different stories happen time.
making something, idea is. people engage
it, different idea is. like different reason
dislike reason different reason like it. can't
control things. part can control relate
thing make. external information undermines clarity
connection probably bad art guess. again, saying
experience. try make things-- ever tried make something like
something felt like missing fan wanted, nobody making it.
make it, wasn't-- always service love thing. want
something like this.

00:41:27 Finishing Projects; Source & Nature

No one else making one. make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
beautiful, word keeps coming mind almost like compulsion.
Like options ways behave function work life.
something compulsion, yanks us away opportunities, just
enough get back it. talked about, talk
book, notion source. me, again, can't help put neuroscientist
lens this. think source not one brain area function within
brain, touch bodily signals. Like feels right, doesn't?
like tasting two foods, love example. playbook far
vast short term adaptive playbook, like going get point
point B. yet, listen album song, assume there,
point, becomes not strategy development creativity strategy
implementation. Like needs songs going come order--
don't know much music. musician friends always laughing. RICK RUBIN:
not much music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, ordering
sequence melodies, et cetera. point one decide, OK, like


now's time get narrow focus effort? Like got it. run
this. component creative process involves packaging
finishing. part less satisfying you, just part larger
arc? RICK RUBIN: part same. nice. good feeling.
usually good feeling something done. one hand, commitment,
time say done, can keep experimenting
changing it. think, well, maybe tomorrow can make better, not finished.
keep thinking long time, can forever never put
anything. getting point ready sign off good feeling,
allows you-- one things talk book is, difficult thing
do, fun play, fun maybe not best yet. use
whatever next project going motivation finish one working
now. Like working this. spending time thing. really good.
believe can better, thing really want make.
keep tinkering one, never get make one. using projects
impetus finish something release world good one.
said description source something within us. don't know say
accurate. definitely us too, not us. think source
organizing principle everything, everything exists. trees grow,
mountains. anything can see outside world,
every discovery every piece art every new design every machine
outgrowths source energy. part antenna connects it,
maybe vehicle source allow things happen world. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: thank that, indeed misspeak. recall
distinctly book, described physical world constrained
laws physics certain things. imagination unconstrained. think
right, said work set somewhere those, neither one
other. ultimately feeds imagination way, indeed,
brain physical entity. nature outside world provides least
appears near infinite not infinite options. love example color
palette. restrict whatever sorts paints medium have,
restricted. nature, infinite number shades tones
combinations. RICK RUBIN: even one, pick rock look color
rock tried find paint match rock, never match.


much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different
scales, spatial scales, time scales too, spatial scales, delight comes
nature pictures-- seemed like '80s, like
see drop oil shot high resolution. beauty drop oil.
see Earth galaxy, beauty too, extremes.
course, daily perception

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go
different room, can't see model, paint model, instead of--
changes relationship. not just painting lines. painting
interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

work. talk writing book structure
unique. never encountered book kind structure before,
facile read ever, yet every single page, underlined, took notes, starred. like,
notice, worn, very, worn already time.
process removing functions day last week
going order get access this-- going think now
receiver inside you. Right? Almost like tuning radio, [IMITATING STATIC]
comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works
progress spend time listening day looking ideas. stay
far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:
think relationship music, relationship love. didn't listen

loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: felt loved it,

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't

always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.

ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,

not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least

places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.


plays get advice people experience you.
explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not

somehow crack code right us, happy it,
still know, wonder way. Maybe even better way
not considering. Not get comfortable thinking

02:29:42 Public Opinion & Science: Light, Acupuncture & Nutrition

know works just get outcome want. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: raised science principle. literally dictated
principle, almost like rule religion, brain plastic. can change
learn 25. critical periods end it.
rule. Essentially, dictated Nobel Prize, deserved, given
scientific great grandparents. deserve it. told no changing
brain structure function meaningful way age 25 so. turns
completely wrong. Sorry David Torsten, knew wrong. RICK RUBIN:
Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed
competitive nature prizes discoveries time. guy
named Mike Merzenich student, Gregg Recanzone showing adult
plasticity exists now really starting emerge theme, just crazy.
many reasons textbooks said it. told it.
changed behavior. Now know completely false. plasticity

different story. RICK RUBIN: time ever happened?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. field run small cabal people
time. RICK RUBIN: fields run small cabal people
investment things way now charge. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now
division National Institutes Health called complementary alternative
health. amazing. NCCIH run woman published on--
interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe
hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right, exactly. Well, landscape nutrition
sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different
areas. Fashion probably people. just not aware are. Music
theirs. sports theirs. science characters. just pro-
wrestling characters different domains taking
way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never
something done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, yeah, interesting area
definitely making headway inside standard academic science medicine

probably look clues guess. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look clues sounds
like sounds right. since wrote it, guessing right. RICK RUBIN: Well
something like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think clues
everywhere? RICK RUBIN: Yes, think clues everywhere. pay attention,
hear phrase. It'll trigger thought. see something unexpected. someone
recommends something you, maybe coincidence. three people recommend

comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Elon getting us Mars might bit of--
maybe just want get Mars. RICK RUBIN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: starting feel like channeling Lex Freedman

mystical people little bit like just playing ideas, exactly

say, something else? good example might be-- pulling
podcast episodes had. Alia Crum amazing psychologist
works belief effects. knowledge strongly shapes physiological outcome.
amazing graduate thesis said, exercise placebo,
it? Yeah, burn calories things. Turns isn't case.
turns lot effects exercise, positive effects-- lowering blood pressure,
relieving stress, positive placebo nobody thinks like
attached calories burned, et cetera. RICK RUBIN: think big point

great better don't believe can. say, ability harness

02:46:25 Attention, Emotion & Art



hear allows see something didn't see before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going ask whether not, important happy order create,
certainly lot people unhappy still able create.
listen you, seems really ability pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: unhappy happy may not relevant
whether not able stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. say that's--
say able stay present work probably important part it.
feel less issue unless feel gets way feeling
work makes feel. know saying? lot pain
looking piece art, may hard know art makes feel
you're-- big signal body physical pain. sure
people can too, can, even physical pain, can feel it.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, idea transmutation, taking one emotion

02:48:07 Mantra Meditation, Awareness Meditation

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either
engaging mantra, version almost creating trance
ourselves, not unlike listening something go sleep distract


conscious mind participating. overriding talking mind just
sound generating, word, phrase, series phrases. Meta meditation
loving kindness meditation phrases, focused
breath. purpose focused breath not hear self-talk
normally have. single pointed focus exercise described.
version awareness meditation, closing eyes.
whatever noticing-- now, eyes open
eyes closed awareness practice. first thing
feel-- feel little ringing ears. might electronic equipment around
us. don't mean hear sound. like vibration. hear cars passing
distance. see else comes out, can feel feeling chest. can feel
part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.
cases, example awareness meditation, mantra
meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince
give us suggestions one two can link listeners. sure
appreciate. RICK RUBIN: also meditation like practices
involve-- something called surgical series Monroe Institute
used surgery. listen recording. allows body
heal much faster remove trauma goes getting cut open--
traumatic. just listening certain things, can really powerful
effect, heal much faster. remember put surgery.
eyes closed. wasn't communicating anyone going
inside. wife me. came in. said, oh, already
gave Rick sedative ready go in. don't think gave anything.
like, look numbers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. Yeah, amazingly
powerful practice like anyone can cultivate. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely,
absolutely. no good bad version. really just-- learn technique
show it, works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, love
willing share process. Listen, just want say thank
number things. want thank music created
create want still ongoing, certainly time today sharing
thought process bit goes incredible creative process. want
thank writing book. don't talk feature many books
podcast. just not something typically do, seen little bit evolution
it. seen now read final form twice, mentioned.
going continue read again. one books
filled gems, like every chapter. take notes this. take notes this.
assembled digestible way allows people extract meaningful
parts every chapter. many way straightforward.
love book. thank certainly didn't write


book. happy did. know already benefited know
many people going benefit. amazing book. couldn't help put
neuroscience lens it. also, halfway through, learned discard pre-
existing lens bit start see things think different perspective.
just want thank incredible portal also
amazing friend. RICK RUBIN: Thank you. love you. happy you.

value. capture it? RICK RUBIN: Yes. think language insufficient drill
creativity. closer magic science. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
kids come world, think better access creative
process adults? start impart rule plays books. Like will
get likes? Will people like it? also things available us
not paying attention to, like texture table, discarding things,
systematically. get, quote, unquote, set ways. think kids are, just
definition design, creative adults? RICK RUBIN: Yes. Kids,
open, no baggage. don't belief system. don't know
things supposed work. just see is, pay attention
is, learn much we-- us select endless number data
points available us to, well, species, make sure don't die
procreate feed probably primary functions first.
learn things right wrong, learn things
certain things. inspired someone makes something love,
want way it. things undermine purity
creative process. can tools build skill set able yourself. Like
singer, might imitate singer really like get good
eventually come find voice. doesn't always start
voice. three years old five years old, try singing, not
singing like anyone else. singing voice. make
something, making based not knowing. think advantage, early
career, starting making music without experience, helpful,
didn't know rules breaking. wasn't intentional breaking
rules. just seemed right me,

00:17:36 Feelings & Creative Ideas

didn't realize things people wouldn't do. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: idea no new ideas. disagree, every
while, see hear something least seems different enough. RICK
RUBIN: think combination of-- new combination existing ideas presented
new way. think works. don't know. will say, seem like
things interesting series familiar elements joined together


way creating something never seen before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned close see hints creativity real
value feeling, also believe body great source information.
people will realize brain, course, skull, nervous
system extends everywhere body, whole mind-body thing just falls away.
Philosophers argued forever, silly argument. also true that,
God forbid, amputate limbs, amputated, fundamentally still
me. Right? not true took big enough chunk brain,
still survived. fundamentally different human being. still
name identity social security number, behave differently.
knows, maybe better? signals body know, least assume,
pretty generic. Like can think 50 different ways 100 ways talk
creativity today. define redefine carve serve like
sushi bunch different ways. body sends signals us are--
course understanding of. like, oh, stomach hurts, stomach feels
good, not sensing stomach. oh, feels good. feels warm. feels cold.
Like us aren't trained understanding interpret signals.
almost like vowels, syllables, isn't lot more. Whereas,
talk thoughts experiences, depending hyper verbal
somebody much emphasis put different sounds, near infinite. Not
infinite, near infinite. personally, know end
thread creativity-- maybe listening artist, hearing something.
like antennae start deflect certain way. Right?
feel body recognizable sensation, thought
sensation? RICK RUBIN: feeling body. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
localized? RICK RUBIN: No. feeling of-- say like surge energy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: remember first time experienced that? RICK
RUBIN: Probably hearing Beatles, three four years old. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Three four years old? RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wow. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: something wrong
Beatles never done me? RICK RUBIN: No. Maybe just weren't
exposed right time right way. no right wrong way, everyone--
can love Beatles, can not, right. not-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: glad can still friends. little concerned. little


scared ask question. know taste music little bit obscure
fragmentary, good. always felt like, gosh, must something wrong
me. like songs, don't-- no juice there. RICK RUBIN: think
maybe watch-- eight-part series called Beatles Anthology,
print. can try find somewhere, can watch together,
maybe that'll make case Beatles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Nothing
them, just always bothering story, like Ramones. saw that,
like, wow, like jeans, aviators, everyone change last name
Ramone, lot hated other. much drama there, three
chords just-- me, just like, wow, like kids New York, energy.

00:22:01 Rules, Choice & Art; Personal Taste & Other’s Opinions

think different things different people. Right? RICK RUBIN: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings question something feels
creatively right, sensing it, there, say studio maybe
even listening something somebody sent you, translate that,
given absence language? translate conversation
artist? again, writing comedy science podcasting,
matter. say that, keep going way, might not even
recognize it? guessing lot times, don't. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. Sometimes, don't. depends. the-- try setting
where, talking it, can engage moment. not much
good. say producing new record, played something,
thoughts it. wouldn't helpful tell were.
It'd better us wait till place try things see
goes. first thing wouldn't rely language it.
making suggestion something actionable. try it,
data. either moving good direction, moving away from--
moving towards away it, never know. always experiment.
maybe simple way talk like, gave two dishes food
asked taste tell one like better. Usually, pretty
straightforward, two choices, like better, think
creativity can boiled that. different wonder going


perform certain social media platforms? different it--
tasting two things, one want finish eating? say,
like one better, needs little salt, put little salt it. like, maybe
put much salt, know taste it. like simple. tune
enough really know feel face knowing
people might feel differently, part challenge. like, everyone tells
A, A, A, A, A, A, listen, like B, artist, important
able say, me, B. disconnect, much of, go
school, get us follow rules. art, different, rules
scaffolding chipped away, need be. Sometimes, helpful.
Sometimes, not, sometimes, even impose rules give
something shape. can decide make a-- going make painting,
going use green red colors allowed use.
decide advance, solve problem knowing
green red? can-- otherwise, infinite number choices,
anything can anything. like, sometimes choices not better. limiting
palate something manageable forces solve problems different way. Now,
digital age music-wise, can make anything digitally. no--
time when, didn't guitar studio, couldn't record guitar.
couldn't hire orchestra, couldn't orchestra recording. Now, can
just call things up. infinite choices, infinite choices don't
necessarily lead better compositions better final works. Understanding feel
face voices, without second guessing yourself, probably single
important thing practice artist. skill set develop artist know
feel, feelings. key not know, know
right you. doesn't work way. just know me, reason chose
artist demonstrate see it. undermining taste
commercial idea, defeats whole purpose this. not process
about. process me, showing am. can like
not, either way, still see it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that,
science, trained graduate students, graduate student,
blessed mentors, one real iconoclast. dead now.
Actually, advisors dead-- suicide, cancer, cancer. joke don't want
work you. morbid sense humor, laughing


this, someplace, right now. RICK RUBIN: thought going say ate
poison mushrooms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, last one said me,
common denominator, Andrew. thought, oh goodness, said, kind just
kidding, not really. little bit eerie. case, always said-- name
Ben-- always said, one thing can't teach taste, one predictor
people will never develop ones perfectionists.
filtering their-- perfectionists filter perfection
feedback others. always looking person putting little bit
middle finger feedback. Not much get things wrong,
can badly wrong science. can wrong right reasons, can also
wrong wrong reasons. people just almost compulsion
way believe doing. hearing that,
hearing describing. also think something
human empathic process emotional process, see somebody
something seem really not paying attention anyone else
doing-- guess crazy person street one version it, go
just experience, just crazy. somebody seems enjoying
emotion seems real, think good fraction people
feel gravitational pull, go, yeah, that. best example
remember growing skateboard thing first-- first
start baggy, sagging clothes thing, got teased endlessly one year
school. Then, bunch hip hop came out, guys wearing
sagging jeans shorts. Next year, come back, people
making fun us it, clicked me. like,
people don't actually know like. RICK RUBIN: No.

00:30:20 Changing Perspective & Creativity

ANDREW HUBERMAN: like like certainty people
like. question is, landscape creative stuff, real?
not real? almost like whoever can create convincing story least
captures good number of-- good fraction audiences, not
creative artist needs do. need actually depart that. right?
RICK RUBIN: Well just two different things. Like coming story


purpose pleasing someone else skill set, commercial endeavor
artistic endeavor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like tactical. Yeah. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
thinking, book, describe, again, thinking creative
process cloud, me, again, serves powerful anchor. think
biology, neurobiology, like strategy formation strategy implementation
almost sheer luck, miraculously, turn pages later book,
description animals trying accomplish something-- eat,
mate, find water, accomplish requirements living-- requires narrow visual
focus. something lab obsessed with, obsessed with.
narrow visual focus, know playbook becomes narrow.
rule set narrow. Now, point, order come new creative
idea, means broadening vision essential, way, broadening
thinking. RICK RUBIN: Well, either broadening narrowing,
changing aperture standard. reason present something
new maybe already knew didn't know knew it.
case, looking it. not unlike comedian does. Comedian
makes laugh. Usually, saying, outrageous, know
right. Just no one says way, no one said way before. always
truth makes funny. like that. idea recognizing
something seems really obvious, see it, seems like nobody else sees
it, no one else points out. feel like science like too, much
science, light flashes head, like got it, just seems like, well,
knew forever. No one knew it, know saying? like
obvious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN: obvious. think
another superpower artists accepting don't know anything. think
know things, also limits world. think know like this.
possible, nice little box. reality, say case?
say the-- take believe science now

00:33:55 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

decide throw away start scratch. probably create
whole different one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break

mine, guest podcast, Eddie Chang, chair neurosurgery,
place top 1% neuroscientists. pulling speech people
completely paralyzed locked-in syndrome, et cetera. asked him,
percentage contained medical textbooks training-- RICK RUBIN:
Today ANDREW HUBERMAN: Today. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. went medical
school today, learned textbook, percentage
information accurate, percentage not? said, maybe half. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Right, asked, consequence that? said,
incalculable, completely agree. asked second time, still came
answer. good sign. Reliability experiment next
good. Yeah. think idea really know things. science,
observed amazing discoveries chance. observed amazing discoveries
incredible bouts hard work. cases, people spending lot time
lab. Like no one walked lab, saw something one day, Nobel Prize
winning discovery fundamental discovery. hanging lab lot. Just


came something didn't expect. Others drilling
toward answer. RICK RUBIN: cases, breakthroughs
happen-- guessing. don't know this-- considering assume information,
discovery true, based everything came it. everything
came wrong, discoveries probably built a-- know
saying? like context, everything happens takes account
context sitting fits context. Maybe context isn't right. knows?
don't know. saying, close things thinking, think
things, lot assumptions go it. new
discoveries essentially built top beliefs, beliefs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: remember-- course, listened Beastie Boys growing up.
didn't? child 90s, the-- Sabotage outgrowth
skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones like girl movies. worlds,
Beastie Boys skateboarding really closely interwoven while. people
know that. people don't. Spike formed bridge, Spike went off
started making bigger movies people watch. just use
example. heard say guys joking around, like
Beastie Boys, like guys hip hop, kind like hardcore scene,
New York, punk rock scene, joke. lot inside jokes.
working together, thought people might love it, might hate it,
just weren't paying attention all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention all.
Never considered it. no-- point time, making
Licensed Ill, hip hop music tiny underground thing. no one making hip hop
time thought ever mean anything. not realistic thought.
making really crazy friends, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think, nowadays, fact one can create something and, quote, unquote,
release quickly. can put something onto Twitter Instagram now.
10 seconds now, will get immediate feedback, external feedback,
course, can iterate basis feedback. think
problematic larger opportunity creativity? words, go back
20 years even 15 years, opportunity create certainly still there,
really didn't know going land you, quote, unquote, released it.
seems opportunity stay magical rainforest
creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: don't think wrong right. just information


can use not use use useful way. can make something
put out, people not like it. like, oh, still don't get it. going
got go harder. Like got go harder direction not-- know
saying? like not react away information. can helpful. can helpful
when-- different stories happen time.
making something, idea is. people engage
it, different idea is. like different reason
dislike reason different reason like it. can't
control things. part can control relate
thing make. external information undermines clarity
connection probably bad art guess. again, saying
experience. try make things-- ever tried make something like
something felt like missing fan wanted, nobody making it.
make it, wasn't-- always service love thing. want
something like this.

00:41:27 Finishing Projects; Source & Nature

No one else making one. make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
beautiful, word keeps coming mind almost like compulsion.
Like options ways behave function work life.
something compulsion, yanks us away opportunities, just
enough get back it. talked about, talk
book, notion source. me, again, can't help put neuroscientist
lens this. think source not one brain area function within
brain, touch bodily signals. Like feels right, doesn't?
like tasting two foods, love example. playbook far
vast short term adaptive playbook, like going get point
point B. yet, listen album song, assume there,
point, becomes not strategy development creativity strategy
implementation. Like needs songs going come order--
don't know much music. musician friends always laughing. RICK RUBIN:
not much music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, ordering
sequence melodies, et cetera. point one decide, OK, like


now's time get narrow focus effort? Like got it. run
this. component creative process involves packaging
finishing. part less satisfying you, just part larger
arc? RICK RUBIN: part same. nice. good feeling.
usually good feeling something done. one hand, commitment,
time say done, can keep experimenting
changing it. think, well, maybe tomorrow can make better, not finished.
keep thinking long time, can forever never put
anything. getting point ready sign off good feeling,
allows you-- one things talk book is, difficult thing
do, fun play, fun maybe not best yet. use
whatever next project going motivation finish one working
now. Like working this. spending time thing. really good.
believe can better, thing really want make.
keep tinkering one, never get make one. using projects
impetus finish something release world good one.
said description source something within us. don't know say
accurate. definitely us too, not us. think source
organizing principle everything, everything exists. trees grow,
mountains. anything can see outside world,
every discovery every piece art every new design every machine
outgrowths source energy. part antenna connects it,
maybe vehicle source allow things happen world. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: thank that, indeed misspeak. recall
distinctly book, described physical world constrained
laws physics certain things. imagination unconstrained. think
right, said work set somewhere those, neither one
other. ultimately feeds imagination way, indeed,
brain physical entity. nature outside world provides least
appears near infinite not infinite options. love example color
palette. restrict whatever sorts paints medium have,
restricted. nature, infinite number shades tones
combinations. RICK RUBIN: even one, pick rock look color
rock tried find paint match rock, never match.


much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different
scales, spatial scales, time scales too, spatial scales, delight comes
nature pictures-- seemed like '80s, like
see drop oil shot high resolution. beauty drop oil.
see Earth galaxy, beauty too, extremes.
course, daily perception

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go

interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

work. talk writing book structure
unique. never encountered book kind structure before,
facile read ever, yet every single page, underlined, took notes, starred. like,
notice, worn, very, worn already time.
process removing functions day last week
going order get access this-- going think now

comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works

far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.

passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat

elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines

something works, easy fooled believing way

lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals

know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science

editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,

sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come

something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:

OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting

podcast named Justin Sonnenburg. expert gut microbiome.
applied something that-- without knowing, applied opposite principle, opposite
true principle. talking trillions gut microbiota clearly
amazing things create, neurotransmitters, govern brain, even
decision making, much sugar system driving appetite, et cetera.
said, think cargo, maybe just vehicles charge.
interactions like every time shake hands touch eyes,
exchanging gut microbiota. think intelligence thinking intelligence.
microbiologist. seriousness said, maybe ones
manipulated. house cats. think are, falling love,
kissing, shaking hands, washing hands, sorts things isolate
connect one another. maybe gut microbiota really trying optimize
survival. RICK RUBIN: Laird Hamilton said one point


sauna-- sauna, really hot. feeling
wanting get bad critters body can't handle it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Like get here. RICK RUBIN: trying convince you,
inside, get out. Maybe feeling compelled get
comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Elon getting us Mars might bit of--
maybe just want get Mars. RICK RUBIN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: starting feel like channeling Lex Freedman
moment. No, think considering opposite really key. might sound
mystical people little bit like just playing ideas, exactly
science. Someone walks result says, found this. true.
say, something else? good example might be-- pulling
podcast episodes had. Alia Crum amazing psychologist
works belief effects. knowledge strongly shapes physiological outcome.
amazing graduate thesis said, exercise placebo,
it? Yeah, burn calories things. Turns isn't case.
turns lot effects exercise, positive effects-- lowering blood pressure,
relieving stress, positive placebo nobody thinks like
attached calories burned, et cetera. RICK RUBIN: think big point
belief part huge part conversation everything. believe
power. believe can make something great, chances us making something
great better don't believe can. say, ability harness
belief behalf really healthy thing do. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one thing make clear abilities may come question
time time, absolutely believe elements create
there. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely. elements here. Everything here. get
pick choose. get to-- conveyor belts going little gifts. can-
- first, notice conveyor belt. notice gifts.
starting point. may even feel empowered enough grab one
gifts, open up, see inside. maybe started something
really beautiful wouldn't done. Everything make made
always based something see

02:46:25 Attention, Emotion & Art



hear allows see something didn't see before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going ask whether not, important happy order create,
certainly lot people unhappy still able create.
listen you, seems really ability pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: unhappy happy may not relevant
whether not able stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. say that's--
say able stay present work probably important part it.
feel less issue unless feel gets way feeling
work makes feel. know saying? lot pain
looking piece art, may hard know art makes feel
you're-- big signal body physical pain. sure
people can too, can, even physical pain, can feel it.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, idea transmutation, taking one emotion
contorting co-opting another action adaptive way. idea
distraction problem, really resonates, think. think times great
productivity able undistracted. also see success can
distraction. often discussed context fighting sports,
someone starts making lot money pretty soon focus becomes things
can access success opposed

02:48:07 Mantra Meditation, Awareness Meditation

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either
engaging mantra, version almost creating trance
ourselves, not unlike listening something go sleep distract


conscious mind participating. overriding talking mind just
sound generating, word, phrase, series phrases. Meta meditation
loving kindness meditation phrases, focused
breath. purpose focused breath not hear self-talk
normally have. single pointed focus exercise described.
version awareness meditation, closing eyes.
whatever noticing-- now, eyes open
eyes closed awareness practice. first thing
feel-- feel little ringing ears. might electronic equipment around
us. don't mean hear sound. like vibration. hear cars passing
distance. see else comes out, can feel feeling chest. can feel
part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.
cases, example awareness meditation, mantra
meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince
give us suggestions one two can link listeners. sure
appreciate. RICK RUBIN: also meditation like practices
involve-- something called surgical series Monroe Institute
used surgery. listen recording. allows body
heal much faster remove trauma goes getting cut open--
traumatic. just listening certain things, can really powerful
effect, heal much faster. remember put surgery.
eyes closed. wasn't communicating anyone going
inside. wife me. came in. said, oh, already
gave Rick sedative ready go in. don't think gave anything.
like, look numbers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. Yeah, amazingly
powerful practice like anyone can cultivate. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely,
absolutely. no good bad version. really just-- learn technique
show it, works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, love
willing share process. Listen, just want say thank
number things. want thank music created
create want still ongoing, certainly time today sharing
thought process bit goes incredible creative process. want
thank writing book. don't talk feature many books
podcast. just not something typically do, seen little bit evolution
it. seen now read final form twice, mentioned.
going continue read again. one books
filled gems, like every chapter. take notes this. take notes this.
assembled digestible way allows people extract meaningful
parts every chapter. many way straightforward.
love book. thank certainly didn't write


book. happy did. know already benefited know
many people going benefit. amazing book. couldn't help put
neuroscience lens it. also, halfway through, learned discard pre-
existing lens bit start see things think different perspective.
just want thank incredible portal also
amazing friend. RICK RUBIN: Thank you. love you. happy you.

way creating something never seen before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
mentioned close see hints creativity real
value feeling, also believe body great source information.
people will realize brain, course, skull, nervous
system extends everywhere body, whole mind-body thing just falls away.
Philosophers argued forever, silly argument. also true that,
God forbid, amputate limbs, amputated, fundamentally still
me. Right? not true took big enough chunk brain,
still survived. fundamentally different human being. still
name identity social security number, behave differently.
knows, maybe better? signals body know, least assume,
pretty generic. Like can think 50 different ways 100 ways talk
creativity today. define redefine carve serve like
sushi bunch different ways. body sends signals us are--
course understanding of. like, oh, stomach hurts, stomach feels
good, not sensing stomach. oh, feels good. feels warm. feels cold.
Like us aren't trained understanding interpret signals.
almost like vowels, syllables, isn't lot more. Whereas,
talk thoughts experiences, depending hyper verbal
somebody much emphasis put different sounds, near infinite. Not
infinite, near infinite. personally, know end
thread creativity-- maybe listening artist, hearing something.
like antennae start deflect certain way. Right?
feel body recognizable sensation, thought
sensation? RICK RUBIN: feeling body. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
localized? RICK RUBIN: No. feeling of-- say like surge energy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: remember first time experienced that? RICK
RUBIN: Probably hearing Beatles, three four years old. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Three four years old? RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Wow. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: something wrong
Beatles never done me? RICK RUBIN: No. Maybe just weren't
exposed right time right way. no right wrong way, everyone--
can love Beatles, can not, right. not-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: glad can still friends. little concerned. little


scared ask question. know taste music little bit obscure
fragmentary, good. always felt like, gosh, must something wrong
me. like songs, don't-- no juice there. RICK RUBIN: think
maybe watch-- eight-part series called Beatles Anthology,
print. can try find somewhere, can watch together,
maybe that'll make case Beatles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Nothing
them, just always bothering story, like Ramones. saw that,
like, wow, like jeans, aviators, everyone change last name
Ramone, lot hated other. much drama there, three
chords just-- me, just like, wow, like kids New York, energy.

00:22:01 Rules, Choice & Art; Personal Taste & Other’s Opinions

think different things different people. Right? RICK RUBIN: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings question something feels
creatively right, sensing it, there, say studio maybe
even listening something somebody sent you, translate that,
given absence language? translate conversation
artist? again, writing comedy science podcasting,
matter. say that, keep going way, might not even
recognize it? guessing lot times, don't. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. Sometimes, don't. depends. the-- try setting
where, talking it, can engage moment. not much
good. say producing new record, played something,
thoughts it. wouldn't helpful tell were.
It'd better us wait till place try things see
goes. first thing wouldn't rely language it.
making suggestion something actionable. try it,
data. either moving good direction, moving away from--
moving towards away it, never know. always experiment.
maybe simple way talk like, gave two dishes food
asked taste tell one like better. Usually, pretty
straightforward, two choices, like better, think
creativity can boiled that. different wonder going


perform certain social media platforms? different it--
tasting two things, one want finish eating? say,
like one better, needs little salt, put little salt it. like, maybe
put much salt, know taste it. like simple. tune
enough really know feel face knowing
people might feel differently, part challenge. like, everyone tells
A, A, A, A, A, A, listen, like B, artist, important
able say, me, B. disconnect, much of, go
school, get us follow rules. art, different, rules
scaffolding chipped away, need be. Sometimes, helpful.
Sometimes, not, sometimes, even impose rules give
something shape. can decide make a-- going make painting,
going use green red colors allowed use.
decide advance, solve problem knowing
green red? can-- otherwise, infinite number choices,
anything can anything. like, sometimes choices not better. limiting
palate something manageable forces solve problems different way. Now,
digital age music-wise, can make anything digitally. no--
time when, didn't guitar studio, couldn't record guitar.
couldn't hire orchestra, couldn't orchestra recording. Now, can
just call things up. infinite choices, infinite choices don't
necessarily lead better compositions better final works. Understanding feel
face voices, without second guessing yourself, probably single
important thing practice artist. skill set develop artist know
feel, feelings. key not know, know
right you. doesn't work way. just know me, reason chose
artist demonstrate see it. undermining taste
commercial idea, defeats whole purpose this. not process
about. process me, showing am. can like
not, either way, still see it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that,
science, trained graduate students, graduate student,
blessed mentors, one real iconoclast. dead now.
Actually, advisors dead-- suicide, cancer, cancer. joke don't want
work you. morbid sense humor, laughing


this, someplace, right now. RICK RUBIN: thought going say ate
poison mushrooms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, last one said me,
common denominator, Andrew. thought, oh goodness, said, kind just
kidding, not really. little bit eerie. case, always said-- name
Ben-- always said, one thing can't teach taste, one predictor
people will never develop ones perfectionists.
filtering their-- perfectionists filter perfection
feedback others. always looking person putting little bit
middle finger feedback. Not much get things wrong,
can badly wrong science. can wrong right reasons, can also
wrong wrong reasons. people just almost compulsion
way believe doing. hearing that,
hearing describing. also think something
human empathic process emotional process, see somebody
something seem really not paying attention anyone else
doing-- guess crazy person street one version it, go
just experience, just crazy. somebody seems enjoying
emotion seems real, think good fraction people
feel gravitational pull, go, yeah, that. best example
remember growing skateboard thing first-- first
start baggy, sagging clothes thing, got teased endlessly one year
school. Then, bunch hip hop came out, guys wearing
sagging jeans shorts. Next year, come back, people
making fun us it, clicked me. like,
people don't actually know like. RICK RUBIN: No.

00:30:20 Changing Perspective & Creativity

ANDREW HUBERMAN: like like certainty people
like. question is, landscape creative stuff, real?
not real? almost like whoever can create convincing story least
captures good number of-- good fraction audiences, not
creative artist needs do. need actually depart that. right?
RICK RUBIN: Well just two different things. Like coming story


purpose pleasing someone else skill set, commercial endeavor
artistic endeavor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like tactical. Yeah. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
thinking, book, describe, again, thinking creative
process cloud, me, again, serves powerful anchor. think
biology, neurobiology, like strategy formation strategy implementation
almost sheer luck, miraculously, turn pages later book,
description animals trying accomplish something-- eat,
mate, find water, accomplish requirements living-- requires narrow visual
focus. something lab obsessed with, obsessed with.
narrow visual focus, know playbook becomes narrow.
rule set narrow. Now, point, order come new creative
idea, means broadening vision essential, way, broadening
thinking. RICK RUBIN: Well, either broadening narrowing,
changing aperture standard. reason present something
new maybe already knew didn't know knew it.
case, looking it. not unlike comedian does. Comedian
makes laugh. Usually, saying, outrageous, know
right. Just no one says way, no one said way before. always
truth makes funny. like that. idea recognizing
something seems really obvious, see it, seems like nobody else sees
it, no one else points out. feel like science like too, much
science, light flashes head, like got it, just seems like, well,
knew forever. No one knew it, know saying? like
obvious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN: obvious. think
another superpower artists accepting don't know anything. think
know things, also limits world. think know like this.
possible, nice little box. reality, say case?
say the-- take believe science now

00:33:55 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

decide throw away start scratch. probably create
whole different one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break

supply vitamin D3 K2. offline conversation one time, asked good friend
mine, guest podcast, Eddie Chang, chair neurosurgery,
place top 1% neuroscientists. pulling speech people
completely paralyzed locked-in syndrome, et cetera. asked him,
percentage contained medical textbooks training-- RICK RUBIN:
Today ANDREW HUBERMAN: Today. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. went medical
school today, learned textbook, percentage
information accurate, percentage not? said, maybe half. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Right, asked, consequence that? said,
incalculable, completely agree. asked second time, still came
answer. good sign. Reliability experiment next
good. Yeah. think idea really know things. science,
observed amazing discoveries chance. observed amazing discoveries
incredible bouts hard work. cases, people spending lot time
lab. Like no one walked lab, saw something one day, Nobel Prize
winning discovery fundamental discovery. hanging lab lot. Just


came something didn't expect. Others drilling
toward answer. RICK RUBIN: cases, breakthroughs
happen-- guessing. don't know this-- considering assume information,
discovery true, based everything came it. everything
came wrong, discoveries probably built a-- know
saying? like context, everything happens takes account
context sitting fits context. Maybe context isn't right. knows?
don't know. saying, close things thinking, think
things, lot assumptions go it. new
discoveries essentially built top beliefs, beliefs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: remember-- course, listened Beastie Boys growing up.
didn't? child 90s, the-- Sabotage outgrowth
skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones like girl movies. worlds,
Beastie Boys skateboarding really closely interwoven while. people
know that. people don't. Spike formed bridge, Spike went off
started making bigger movies people watch. just use
example. heard say guys joking around, like
Beastie Boys, like guys hip hop, kind like hardcore scene,
New York, punk rock scene, joke. lot inside jokes.
working together, thought people might love it, might hate it,
just weren't paying attention all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention all.
Never considered it. no-- point time, making
Licensed Ill, hip hop music tiny underground thing. no one making hip hop
time thought ever mean anything. not realistic thought.
making really crazy friends, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think, nowadays, fact one can create something and, quote, unquote,
release quickly. can put something onto Twitter Instagram now.
10 seconds now, will get immediate feedback, external feedback,
course, can iterate basis feedback. think
problematic larger opportunity creativity? words, go back
20 years even 15 years, opportunity create certainly still there,
really didn't know going land you, quote, unquote, released it.
seems opportunity stay magical rainforest
creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: don't think wrong right. just information


can use not use use useful way. can make something
put out, people not like it. like, oh, still don't get it. going
got go harder. Like got go harder direction not-- know
saying? like not react away information. can helpful. can helpful
when-- different stories happen time.
making something, idea is. people engage
it, different idea is. like different reason
dislike reason different reason like it. can't
control things. part can control relate
thing make. external information undermines clarity
connection probably bad art guess. again, saying
experience. try make things-- ever tried make something like
something felt like missing fan wanted, nobody making it.
make it, wasn't-- always service love thing. want
something like this.

00:41:27 Finishing Projects; Source & Nature

No one else making one. make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
beautiful, word keeps coming mind almost like compulsion.
Like options ways behave function work life.
something compulsion, yanks us away opportunities, just
enough get back it. talked about, talk
book, notion source. me, again, can't help put neuroscientist
lens this. think source not one brain area function within
brain, touch bodily signals. Like feels right, doesn't?
like tasting two foods, love example. playbook far
vast short term adaptive playbook, like going get point
point B. yet, listen album song, assume there,
point, becomes not strategy development creativity strategy
implementation. Like needs songs going come order--
don't know much music. musician friends always laughing. RICK RUBIN:
not much music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, ordering
sequence melodies, et cetera. point one decide, OK, like


now's time get narrow focus effort? Like got it. run
this. component creative process involves packaging
finishing. part less satisfying you, just part larger
arc? RICK RUBIN: part same. nice. good feeling.
usually good feeling something done. one hand, commitment,
time say done, can keep experimenting
changing it. think, well, maybe tomorrow can make better, not finished.
keep thinking long time, can forever never put
anything. getting point ready sign off good feeling,
allows you-- one things talk book is, difficult thing
do, fun play, fun maybe not best yet. use
whatever next project going motivation finish one working
now. Like working this. spending time thing. really good.
believe can better, thing really want make.
keep tinkering one, never get make one. using projects
impetus finish something release world good one.
said description source something within us. don't know say
accurate. definitely us too, not us. think source
organizing principle everything, everything exists. trees grow,
mountains. anything can see outside world,
every discovery every piece art every new design every machine
outgrowths source energy. part antenna connects it,
maybe vehicle source allow things happen world. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: thank that, indeed misspeak. recall
distinctly book, described physical world constrained
laws physics certain things. imagination unconstrained. think
right, said work set somewhere those, neither one
other. ultimately feeds imagination way, indeed,
brain physical entity. nature outside world provides least
appears near infinite not infinite options. love example color
palette. restrict whatever sorts paints medium have,
restricted. nature, infinite number shades tones
combinations. RICK RUBIN: even one, pick rock look color
rock tried find paint match rock, never match.


much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different
scales, spatial scales, time scales too, spatial scales, delight comes
nature pictures-- seemed like '80s, like
see drop oil shot high resolution. beauty drop oil.
see Earth galaxy, beauty too, extremes.
course, daily perception

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go
different room, can't see model, paint model, instead of--
changes relationship. not just painting lines. painting
interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

work. talk writing book structure
unique. never encountered book kind structure before,
facile read ever, yet every single page, underlined, took notes, starred. like,
notice, worn, very, worn already time.
process removing functions day last week
going order get access this-- going think now
receiver inside you. Right? Almost like tuning radio, [IMITATING STATIC]
comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works
progress spend time listening day looking ideas. stay
far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.

remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place

watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.

explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not

Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed

different story. RICK RUBIN: time ever happened?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. field run small cabal people

investment things way now charge. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now
division National Institutes Health called complementary alternative
health. amazing. NCCIH run woman published on--
interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe
hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right, exactly. Well, landscape nutrition
sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different
areas. Fashion probably people. just not aware are. Music
theirs. sports theirs. science characters. just pro-
wrestling characters different domains taking
way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never
something done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, yeah, interesting area

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either
engaging mantra, version almost creating trance

conscious mind participating. overriding talking mind just
sound generating, word, phrase, series phrases. Meta meditation
loving kindness meditation phrases, focused
breath. purpose focused breath not hear self-talk
normally have. single pointed focus exercise described.
version awareness meditation, closing eyes.
whatever noticing-- now, eyes open
eyes closed awareness practice. first thing
feel-- feel little ringing ears. might electronic equipment around
us. don't mean hear sound. like vibration. hear cars passing
distance. see else comes out, can feel feeling chest. can feel
part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.
cases, example awareness meditation, mantra
meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince
give us suggestions one two can link listeners. sure
appreciate. RICK RUBIN: also meditation like practices
involve-- something called surgical series Monroe Institute
used surgery. listen recording. allows body
heal much faster remove trauma goes getting cut open--
traumatic. just listening certain things, can really powerful
effect, heal much faster. remember put surgery.
eyes closed. wasn't communicating anyone going
inside. wife me. came in. said, oh, already
gave Rick sedative ready go in. don't think gave anything.
like, look numbers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. Yeah, amazingly
powerful practice like anyone can cultivate. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely,
absolutely. no good bad version. really just-- learn technique
show it, works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, love
willing share process. Listen, just want say thank
number things. want thank music created
create want still ongoing, certainly time today sharing
thought process bit goes incredible creative process. want
thank writing book. don't talk feature many books
podcast. just not something typically do, seen little bit evolution
it. seen now read final form twice, mentioned.
going continue read again. one books
filled gems, like every chapter. take notes this. take notes this.
assembled digestible way allows people extract meaningful
parts every chapter. many way straightforward.
love book. thank certainly didn't write


book. happy did. know already benefited know
many people going benefit. amazing book. couldn't help put

scared ask question. know taste music little bit obscure
fragmentary, good. always felt like, gosh, must something wrong
me. like songs, don't-- no juice there. RICK RUBIN: think
maybe watch-- eight-part series called Beatles Anthology,
print. can try find somewhere, can watch together,
maybe that'll make case Beatles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Nothing
them, just always bothering story, like Ramones. saw that,
like, wow, like jeans, aviators, everyone change last name
Ramone, lot hated other. much drama there, three
chords just-- me, just like, wow, like kids New York, energy.

00:22:01 Rules, Choice & Art; Personal Taste & Other’s Opinions

think different things different people. Right? RICK RUBIN: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings question something feels
creatively right, sensing it, there, say studio maybe
even listening something somebody sent you, translate that,
given absence language? translate conversation
artist? again, writing comedy science podcasting,
matter. say that, keep going way, might not even
recognize it? guessing lot times, don't. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. Sometimes, don't. depends. the-- try setting
where, talking it, can engage moment. not much
good. say producing new record, played something,
thoughts it. wouldn't helpful tell were.
It'd better us wait till place try things see
goes. first thing wouldn't rely language it.
making suggestion something actionable. try it,
data. either moving good direction, moving away from--
moving towards away it, never know. always experiment.
maybe simple way talk like, gave two dishes food
asked taste tell one like better. Usually, pretty
straightforward, two choices, like better, think
creativity can boiled that. different wonder going


perform certain social media platforms? different it--
tasting two things, one want finish eating? say,
like one better, needs little salt, put little salt it. like, maybe
put much salt, know taste it. like simple. tune
enough really know feel face knowing
people might feel differently, part challenge. like, everyone tells
A, A, A, A, A, A, listen, like B, artist, important
able say, me, B. disconnect, much of, go
school, get us follow rules. art, different, rules
scaffolding chipped away, need be. Sometimes, helpful.
Sometimes, not, sometimes, even impose rules give
something shape. can decide make a-- going make painting,
going use green red colors allowed use.
decide advance, solve problem knowing
green red? can-- otherwise, infinite number choices,
anything can anything. like, sometimes choices not better. limiting
palate something manageable forces solve problems different way. Now,
digital age music-wise, can make anything digitally. no--
time when, didn't guitar studio, couldn't record guitar.
couldn't hire orchestra, couldn't orchestra recording. Now, can
just call things up. infinite choices, infinite choices don't
necessarily lead better compositions better final works. Understanding feel
face voices, without second guessing yourself, probably single
important thing practice artist. skill set develop artist know
feel, feelings. key not know, know
right you. doesn't work way. just know me, reason chose
artist demonstrate see it. undermining taste
commercial idea, defeats whole purpose this. not process
about. process me, showing am. can like
not, either way, still see it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that,
science, trained graduate students, graduate student,
blessed mentors, one real iconoclast. dead now.
Actually, advisors dead-- suicide, cancer, cancer. joke don't want
work you. morbid sense humor, laughing


this, someplace, right now. RICK RUBIN: thought going say ate
poison mushrooms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, last one said me,
common denominator, Andrew. thought, oh goodness, said, kind just
kidding, not really. little bit eerie. case, always said-- name
Ben-- always said, one thing can't teach taste, one predictor
people will never develop ones perfectionists.
filtering their-- perfectionists filter perfection
feedback others. always looking person putting little bit
middle finger feedback. Not much get things wrong,
can badly wrong science. can wrong right reasons, can also
wrong wrong reasons. people just almost compulsion
way believe doing. hearing that,
hearing describing. also think something
human empathic process emotional process, see somebody
something seem really not paying attention anyone else
doing-- guess crazy person street one version it, go
just experience, just crazy. somebody seems enjoying
emotion seems real, think good fraction people
feel gravitational pull, go, yeah, that. best example
remember growing skateboard thing first-- first
start baggy, sagging clothes thing, got teased endlessly one year
school. Then, bunch hip hop came out, guys wearing
sagging jeans shorts. Next year, come back, people
making fun us it, clicked me. like,
people don't actually know like. RICK RUBIN: No.

00:30:20 Changing Perspective & Creativity

ANDREW HUBERMAN: like like certainty people
like. question is, landscape creative stuff, real?
not real? almost like whoever can create convincing story least
captures good number of-- good fraction audiences, not
creative artist needs do. need actually depart that. right?
RICK RUBIN: Well just two different things. Like coming story


purpose pleasing someone else skill set, commercial endeavor
artistic endeavor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like tactical. Yeah. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
thinking, book, describe, again, thinking creative
process cloud, me, again, serves powerful anchor. think
biology, neurobiology, like strategy formation strategy implementation
almost sheer luck, miraculously, turn pages later book,
description animals trying accomplish something-- eat,
mate, find water, accomplish requirements living-- requires narrow visual
focus. something lab obsessed with, obsessed with.
narrow visual focus, know playbook becomes narrow.
rule set narrow. Now, point, order come new creative
idea, means broadening vision essential, way, broadening
thinking. RICK RUBIN: Well, either broadening narrowing,
changing aperture standard. reason present something
new maybe already knew didn't know knew it.
case, looking it. not unlike comedian does. Comedian
makes laugh. Usually, saying, outrageous, know
right. Just no one says way, no one said way before. always
truth makes funny. like that. idea recognizing
something seems really obvious, see it, seems like nobody else sees
it, no one else points out. feel like science like too, much
science, light flashes head, like got it, just seems like, well,
knew forever. No one knew it, know saying? like
obvious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN: obvious. think
another superpower artists accepting don't know anything. think
know things, also limits world. think know like this.
possible, nice little box. reality, say case?
say the-- take believe science now

00:33:55 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

decide throw away start scratch. probably create
whole different one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break

claim special offer, month January, 10 free travel packs, plus year
supply vitamin D3 K2. offline conversation one time, asked good friend
mine, guest podcast, Eddie Chang, chair neurosurgery,
place top 1% neuroscientists. pulling speech people
completely paralyzed locked-in syndrome, et cetera. asked him,
percentage contained medical textbooks training-- RICK RUBIN:
Today ANDREW HUBERMAN: Today. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. went medical
school today, learned textbook, percentage
information accurate, percentage not? said, maybe half. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Right, asked, consequence that? said,
incalculable, completely agree. asked second time, still came
answer. good sign. Reliability experiment next
good. Yeah. think idea really know things. science,
observed amazing discoveries chance. observed amazing discoveries
incredible bouts hard work. cases, people spending lot time
lab. Like no one walked lab, saw something one day, Nobel Prize
winning discovery fundamental discovery. hanging lab lot. Just


came something didn't expect. Others drilling
toward answer. RICK RUBIN: cases, breakthroughs
happen-- guessing. don't know this-- considering assume information,
discovery true, based everything came it. everything
came wrong, discoveries probably built a-- know
saying? like context, everything happens takes account
context sitting fits context. Maybe context isn't right. knows?
don't know. saying, close things thinking, think
things, lot assumptions go it. new
discoveries essentially built top beliefs, beliefs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: remember-- course, listened Beastie Boys growing up.
didn't? child 90s, the-- Sabotage outgrowth
skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones like girl movies. worlds,
Beastie Boys skateboarding really closely interwoven while. people
know that. people don't. Spike formed bridge, Spike went off
started making bigger movies people watch. just use
example. heard say guys joking around, like
Beastie Boys, like guys hip hop, kind like hardcore scene,
New York, punk rock scene, joke. lot inside jokes.
working together, thought people might love it, might hate it,
just weren't paying attention all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention all.
Never considered it. no-- point time, making
Licensed Ill, hip hop music tiny underground thing. no one making hip hop
time thought ever mean anything. not realistic thought.
making really crazy friends, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think, nowadays, fact one can create something and, quote, unquote,
release quickly. can put something onto Twitter Instagram now.
10 seconds now, will get immediate feedback, external feedback,
course, can iterate basis feedback. think
problematic larger opportunity creativity? words, go back
20 years even 15 years, opportunity create certainly still there,
really didn't know going land you, quote, unquote, released it.
seems opportunity stay magical rainforest
creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: don't think wrong right. just information


can use not use use useful way. can make something
put out, people not like it. like, oh, still don't get it. going
got go harder. Like got go harder direction not-- know
saying? like not react away information. can helpful. can helpful
when-- different stories happen time.
making something, idea is. people engage
it, different idea is. like different reason
dislike reason different reason like it. can't
control things. part can control relate
thing make. external information undermines clarity
connection probably bad art guess. again, saying
experience. try make things-- ever tried make something like
something felt like missing fan wanted, nobody making it.
make it, wasn't-- always service love thing. want
something like this.

00:41:27 Finishing Projects; Source & Nature

No one else making one. make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
beautiful, word keeps coming mind almost like compulsion.
Like options ways behave function work life.
something compulsion, yanks us away opportunities, just
enough get back it. talked about, talk
book, notion source. me, again, can't help put neuroscientist
lens this. think source not one brain area function within
brain, touch bodily signals. Like feels right, doesn't?
like tasting two foods, love example. playbook far
vast short term adaptive playbook, like going get point
point B. yet, listen album song, assume there,
point, becomes not strategy development creativity strategy
implementation. Like needs songs going come order--
don't know much music. musician friends always laughing. RICK RUBIN:
not much music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, ordering
sequence melodies, et cetera. point one decide, OK, like


now's time get narrow focus effort? Like got it. run
this. component creative process involves packaging
finishing. part less satisfying you, just part larger
arc? RICK RUBIN: part same. nice. good feeling.
usually good feeling something done. one hand, commitment,
time say done, can keep experimenting
changing it. think, well, maybe tomorrow can make better, not finished.
keep thinking long time, can forever never put
anything. getting point ready sign off good feeling,
allows you-- one things talk book is, difficult thing
do, fun play, fun maybe not best yet. use
whatever next project going motivation finish one working
now. Like working this. spending time thing. really good.
believe can better, thing really want make.
keep tinkering one, never get make one. using projects
impetus finish something release world good one.
said description source something within us. don't know say
accurate. definitely us too, not us. think source
organizing principle everything, everything exists. trees grow,
mountains. anything can see outside world,
every discovery every piece art every new design every machine
outgrowths source energy. part antenna connects it,
maybe vehicle source allow things happen world. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: thank that, indeed misspeak. recall
distinctly book, described physical world constrained
laws physics certain things. imagination unconstrained. think
right, said work set somewhere those, neither one
other. ultimately feeds imagination way, indeed,
brain physical entity. nature outside world provides least
appears near infinite not infinite options. love example color
palette. restrict whatever sorts paints medium have,
restricted. nature, infinite number shades tones
combinations. RICK RUBIN: even one, pick rock look color
rock tried find paint match rock, never match.


much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different
scales, spatial scales, time scales too, spatial scales, delight comes
nature pictures-- seemed like '80s, like
see drop oil shot high resolution. beauty drop oil.
see Earth galaxy, beauty too, extremes.
course, daily perception

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go
different room, can't see model, paint model, instead of--
changes relationship. not just painting lines. painting
interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:
think relationship music, relationship love. didn't listen

loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: felt loved it,

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects

find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture

RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,

yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.

acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science

OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either

probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right

perform certain social media platforms? different it--
tasting two things, one want finish eating? say,
like one better, needs little salt, put little salt it. like, maybe
put much salt, know taste it. like simple. tune
enough really know feel face knowing
people might feel differently, part challenge. like, everyone tells
A, A, A, A, A, A, listen, like B, artist, important
able say, me, B. disconnect, much of, go
school, get us follow rules. art, different, rules
scaffolding chipped away, need be. Sometimes, helpful.
Sometimes, not, sometimes, even impose rules give
something shape. can decide make a-- going make painting,
going use green red colors allowed use.
decide advance, solve problem knowing
green red? can-- otherwise, infinite number choices,
anything can anything. like, sometimes choices not better. limiting
palate something manageable forces solve problems different way. Now,
digital age music-wise, can make anything digitally. no--
time when, didn't guitar studio, couldn't record guitar.
couldn't hire orchestra, couldn't orchestra recording. Now, can
just call things up. infinite choices, infinite choices don't
necessarily lead better compositions better final works. Understanding feel
face voices, without second guessing yourself, probably single
important thing practice artist. skill set develop artist know
feel, feelings. key not know, know
right you. doesn't work way. just know me, reason chose
artist demonstrate see it. undermining taste
commercial idea, defeats whole purpose this. not process
about. process me, showing am. can like
not, either way, still see it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love that,
science, trained graduate students, graduate student,
blessed mentors, one real iconoclast. dead now.
Actually, advisors dead-- suicide, cancer, cancer. joke don't want
work you. morbid sense humor, laughing


this, someplace, right now. RICK RUBIN: thought going say ate
poison mushrooms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, last one said me,
common denominator, Andrew. thought, oh goodness, said, kind just
kidding, not really. little bit eerie. case, always said-- name
Ben-- always said, one thing can't teach taste, one predictor
people will never develop ones perfectionists.
filtering their-- perfectionists filter perfection
feedback others. always looking person putting little bit
middle finger feedback. Not much get things wrong,
can badly wrong science. can wrong right reasons, can also
wrong wrong reasons. people just almost compulsion
way believe doing. hearing that,
hearing describing. also think something
human empathic process emotional process, see somebody
something seem really not paying attention anyone else
doing-- guess crazy person street one version it, go
just experience, just crazy. somebody seems enjoying
emotion seems real, think good fraction people
feel gravitational pull, go, yeah, that. best example
remember growing skateboard thing first-- first
start baggy, sagging clothes thing, got teased endlessly one year
school. Then, bunch hip hop came out, guys wearing
sagging jeans shorts. Next year, come back, people
making fun us it, clicked me. like,
people don't actually know like. RICK RUBIN: No.

00:30:20 Changing Perspective & Creativity

ANDREW HUBERMAN: like like certainty people
like. question is, landscape creative stuff, real?
not real? almost like whoever can create convincing story least
captures good number of-- good fraction audiences, not
creative artist needs do. need actually depart that. right?
RICK RUBIN: Well just two different things. Like coming story


purpose pleasing someone else skill set, commercial endeavor
artistic endeavor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like tactical. Yeah. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
thinking, book, describe, again, thinking creative
process cloud, me, again, serves powerful anchor. think
biology, neurobiology, like strategy formation strategy implementation
almost sheer luck, miraculously, turn pages later book,
description animals trying accomplish something-- eat,
mate, find water, accomplish requirements living-- requires narrow visual
focus. something lab obsessed with, obsessed with.
narrow visual focus, know playbook becomes narrow.
rule set narrow. Now, point, order come new creative
idea, means broadening vision essential, way, broadening
thinking. RICK RUBIN: Well, either broadening narrowing,
changing aperture standard. reason present something
new maybe already knew didn't know knew it.
case, looking it. not unlike comedian does. Comedian
makes laugh. Usually, saying, outrageous, know
right. Just no one says way, no one said way before. always
truth makes funny. like that. idea recognizing
something seems really obvious, see it, seems like nobody else sees
it, no one else points out. feel like science like too, much
science, light flashes head, like got it, just seems like, well,
knew forever. No one knew it, know saying? like
obvious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN: obvious. think
another superpower artists accepting don't know anything. think
know things, also limits world. think know like this.
possible, nice little box. reality, say case?
say the-- take believe science now

00:33:55 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

decide throw away start scratch. probably create
whole different one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like take brief break


acknowledge sponsor, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens all-in-one vitamin
mineral probiotic drink also contains digestive enzymes adaptogens. started
taking Athletic Greens way back 2012. 10 years now taking Athletic
Greens every single day. delighted sponsoring podcast.
reason started taking Athletic Greens, reason still take Athletic Greens,
covers foundational nutritional needs. whether not eating well
enough not, sure covering needs vitamins, minerals,
probiotics, adaptogens combat stress, digestive enzymes really help
digestion. just feel much better drinking Athletic Greens. like try

00:35:04 Scientific Knowledge; Opinions & Art

claim special offer, month January, 10 free travel packs, plus year
supply vitamin D3 K2. offline conversation one time, asked good friend
mine, guest podcast, Eddie Chang, chair neurosurgery,
place top 1% neuroscientists. pulling speech people
completely paralyzed locked-in syndrome, et cetera. asked him,
percentage contained medical textbooks training-- RICK RUBIN:
Today ANDREW HUBERMAN: Today. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. went medical
school today, learned textbook, percentage
information accurate, percentage not? said, maybe half. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Right, asked, consequence that? said,
incalculable, completely agree. asked second time, still came
answer. good sign. Reliability experiment next
good. Yeah. think idea really know things. science,
observed amazing discoveries chance. observed amazing discoveries
incredible bouts hard work. cases, people spending lot time
lab. Like no one walked lab, saw something one day, Nobel Prize
winning discovery fundamental discovery. hanging lab lot. Just


came something didn't expect. Others drilling
toward answer. RICK RUBIN: cases, breakthroughs
happen-- guessing. don't know this-- considering assume information,
discovery true, based everything came it. everything
came wrong, discoveries probably built a-- know
saying? like context, everything happens takes account
context sitting fits context. Maybe context isn't right. knows?
don't know. saying, close things thinking, think
things, lot assumptions go it. new
discoveries essentially built top beliefs, beliefs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: remember-- course, listened Beastie Boys growing up.
didn't? child 90s, the-- Sabotage outgrowth
skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones like girl movies. worlds,
Beastie Boys skateboarding really closely interwoven while. people
know that. people don't. Spike formed bridge, Spike went off
started making bigger movies people watch. just use
example. heard say guys joking around, like
Beastie Boys, like guys hip hop, kind like hardcore scene,
New York, punk rock scene, joke. lot inside jokes.
working together, thought people might love it, might hate it,
just weren't paying attention all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention all.
Never considered it. no-- point time, making
Licensed Ill, hip hop music tiny underground thing. no one making hip hop
time thought ever mean anything. not realistic thought.
making really crazy friends, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think, nowadays, fact one can create something and, quote, unquote,
release quickly. can put something onto Twitter Instagram now.
10 seconds now, will get immediate feedback, external feedback,
course, can iterate basis feedback. think
problematic larger opportunity creativity? words, go back
20 years even 15 years, opportunity create certainly still there,
really didn't know going land you, quote, unquote, released it.
seems opportunity stay magical rainforest
creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: don't think wrong right. just information


can use not use use useful way. can make something
put out, people not like it. like, oh, still don't get it. going
got go harder. Like got go harder direction not-- know
saying? like not react away information. can helpful. can helpful
when-- different stories happen time.
making something, idea is. people engage
it, different idea is. like different reason
dislike reason different reason like it. can't
control things. part can control relate
thing make. external information undermines clarity
connection probably bad art guess. again, saying
experience. try make things-- ever tried make something like
something felt like missing fan wanted, nobody making it.
make it, wasn't-- always service love thing. want
something like this.

00:41:27 Finishing Projects; Source & Nature

No one else making one. make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
beautiful, word keeps coming mind almost like compulsion.
Like options ways behave function work life.
something compulsion, yanks us away opportunities, just
enough get back it. talked about, talk
book, notion source. me, again, can't help put neuroscientist
lens this. think source not one brain area function within
brain, touch bodily signals. Like feels right, doesn't?
like tasting two foods, love example. playbook far
vast short term adaptive playbook, like going get point
point B. yet, listen album song, assume there,
point, becomes not strategy development creativity strategy
implementation. Like needs songs going come order--
don't know much music. musician friends always laughing. RICK RUBIN:
not much music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, ordering
sequence melodies, et cetera. point one decide, OK, like


now's time get narrow focus effort? Like got it. run
this. component creative process involves packaging
finishing. part less satisfying you, just part larger
arc? RICK RUBIN: part same. nice. good feeling.
usually good feeling something done. one hand, commitment,
time say done, can keep experimenting
changing it. think, well, maybe tomorrow can make better, not finished.
keep thinking long time, can forever never put
anything. getting point ready sign off good feeling,
allows you-- one things talk book is, difficult thing
do, fun play, fun maybe not best yet. use
whatever next project going motivation finish one working
now. Like working this. spending time thing. really good.
believe can better, thing really want make.
keep tinkering one, never get make one. using projects
impetus finish something release world good one.
said description source something within us. don't know say
accurate. definitely us too, not us. think source
organizing principle everything, everything exists. trees grow,
mountains. anything can see outside world,
every discovery every piece art every new design every machine
outgrowths source energy. part antenna connects it,
maybe vehicle source allow things happen world. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: thank that, indeed misspeak. recall
distinctly book, described physical world constrained
laws physics certain things. imagination unconstrained. think
right, said work set somewhere those, neither one
other. ultimately feeds imagination way, indeed,
brain physical entity. nature outside world provides least
appears near infinite not infinite options. love example color
palette. restrict whatever sorts paints medium have,
restricted. nature, infinite number shades tones
combinations. RICK RUBIN: even one, pick rock look color
rock tried find paint match rock, never match.


much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different
scales, spatial scales, time scales too, spatial scales, delight comes
nature pictures-- seemed like '80s, like
see drop oil shot high resolution. beauty drop oil.
see Earth galaxy, beauty too, extremes.
course, daily perception

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go
different room, can't see model, paint model, instead of--
changes relationship. not just painting lines. painting
interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

01:03:03 InsideTracker

here. therapy, lying couches. RICK RUBIN: Whatever is.
Whatever is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. probably won't psychedelics,

would, know interested process. spare daily
routine question. cliche. lovers sunlight, horizons,
not trivial source, amazing gift energy. Right? aren't words
really. Aside daily routines, comes somebody going
project project, know going work somebody,


work. talk writing book structure
unique. never encountered book kind structure before,
facile read ever, yet every single page, underlined, took notes, starred. like,
notice, worn, very, worn already time.
process removing functions day last week
going order get access this-- going think now
receiver inside you. Right? Almost like tuning radio, [IMITATING STATIC]
comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works
progress spend time listening day looking ideas. stay
far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:
think relationship music, relationship love. didn't listen
get angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: listened
loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: felt loved it,

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches

saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects
nature like clouds ocean, predictability them. know
find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish
things not happen way did, lot living past.
lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,
remember got staples stapled him. thought pretty intense.
went saw-- guess called Mexican wrestling. don't know call
anymore, guys dip hands-- RICK RUBIN: Lucha libre. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, dip hands glass. Sacramento.
saw it. honestly didn't stomach it. really didn't. couldn't believe legal.
might not legal. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thought-

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,

sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying

lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come

acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,

something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe

sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different

someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never

listen you, seems really ability pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: unhappy happy may not relevant
whether not able stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. say that's--
say able stay present work probably important part it.
feel less issue unless feel gets way feeling
work makes feel. know saying? lot pain
looking piece art, may hard know art makes feel
you're-- big signal body physical pain. sure
people can too, can, even physical pain, can feel it.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, idea transmutation, taking one emotion

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either
engaging mantra, version almost creating trance

conscious mind participating. overriding talking mind just
sound generating, word, phrase, series phrases. Meta meditation
loving kindness meditation phrases, focused

normally have. single pointed focus exercise described.
version awareness meditation, closing eyes.
whatever noticing-- now, eyes open
eyes closed awareness practice. first thing
feel-- feel little ringing ears. might electronic equipment around

distance. see else comes out, can feel feeling chest. can feel
part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.

meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince
give us suggestions one two can link listeners. sure
appreciate. RICK RUBIN: also meditation like practices
involve-- something called surgical series Monroe Institute

like, look numbers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. Yeah, amazingly
powerful practice like anyone can cultivate. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely,
absolutely. no good bad version. really just-- learn technique
show it, works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, love
willing share process. Listen, just want say thank
number things. want thank music created
create want still ongoing, certainly time today sharing
thought process bit goes incredible creative process. want
thank writing book. don't talk feature many books

it. seen now read final form twice, mentioned.
going continue read again. one books
filled gems, like every chapter. take notes this. take notes this.
assembled digestible way allows people extract meaningful
parts every chapter. many way straightforward.
love book. thank certainly didn't write


book. happy did. know already benefited know
many people going benefit. amazing book. couldn't help put

this, someplace, right now. RICK RUBIN: thought going say ate
poison mushrooms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, last one said me,
common denominator, Andrew. thought, oh goodness, said, kind just
kidding, not really. little bit eerie. case, always said-- name
Ben-- always said, one thing can't teach taste, one predictor
people will never develop ones perfectionists.
filtering their-- perfectionists filter perfection
feedback others. always looking person putting little bit
middle finger feedback. Not much get things wrong,
can badly wrong science. can wrong right reasons, can also
wrong wrong reasons. people just almost compulsion
way believe doing. hearing that,
hearing describing. also think something
human empathic process emotional process, see somebody
something seem really not paying attention anyone else
doing-- guess crazy person street one version it, go
just experience, just crazy. somebody seems enjoying
emotion seems real, think good fraction people
feel gravitational pull, go, yeah, that. best example
remember growing skateboard thing first-- first
start baggy, sagging clothes thing, got teased endlessly one year
school. Then, bunch hip hop came out, guys wearing
sagging jeans shorts. Next year, come back, people
making fun us it, clicked me. like,
people don't actually know like. RICK RUBIN: No.

00:30:20 Changing Perspective & Creativity

ANDREW HUBERMAN: like like certainty people
like. question is, landscape creative stuff, real?
not real? almost like whoever can create convincing story least
captures good number of-- good fraction audiences, not
creative artist needs do. need actually depart that. right?
RICK RUBIN: Well just two different things. Like coming story


purpose pleasing someone else skill set, commercial endeavor
artistic endeavor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: like tactical. Yeah. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
thinking, book, describe, again, thinking creative
process cloud, me, again, serves powerful anchor. think
biology, neurobiology, like strategy formation strategy implementation
almost sheer luck, miraculously, turn pages later book,
description animals trying accomplish something-- eat,
mate, find water, accomplish requirements living-- requires narrow visual
focus. something lab obsessed with, obsessed with.
narrow visual focus, know playbook becomes narrow.
rule set narrow. Now, point, order come new creative
idea, means broadening vision essential, way, broadening
thinking. RICK RUBIN: Well, either broadening narrowing,
changing aperture standard. reason present something
new maybe already knew didn't know knew it.
case, looking it. not unlike comedian does. Comedian
makes laugh. Usually, saying, outrageous, know
right. Just no one says way, no one said way before. always
truth makes funny. like that. idea recognizing
something seems really obvious, see it, seems like nobody else sees
it, no one else points out. feel like science like too, much
science, light flashes head, like got it, just seems like, well,
knew forever. No one knew it, know saying? like
obvious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN: obvious. think
another superpower artists accepting don't know anything. think
know things, also limits world. think know like this.
possible, nice little box. reality, say case?
say the-- take believe science now

incalculable, completely agree. asked second time, still came
answer. good sign. Reliability experiment next
good. Yeah. think idea really know things. science,
observed amazing discoveries chance. observed amazing discoveries
incredible bouts hard work. cases, people spending lot time
lab. Like no one walked lab, saw something one day, Nobel Prize
winning discovery fundamental discovery. hanging lab lot. Just


came something didn't expect. Others drilling
toward answer. RICK RUBIN: cases, breakthroughs
happen-- guessing. don't know this-- considering assume information,
discovery true, based everything came it. everything
came wrong, discoveries probably built a-- know
saying? like context, everything happens takes account
context sitting fits context. Maybe context isn't right. knows?
don't know. saying, close things thinking, think
things, lot assumptions go it. new
discoveries essentially built top beliefs, beliefs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: remember-- course, listened Beastie Boys growing up.
didn't? child 90s, the-- Sabotage outgrowth
skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones like girl movies. worlds,
Beastie Boys skateboarding really closely interwoven while. people
know that. people don't. Spike formed bridge, Spike went off
started making bigger movies people watch. just use
example. heard say guys joking around, like
Beastie Boys, like guys hip hop, kind like hardcore scene,
New York, punk rock scene, joke. lot inside jokes.
working together, thought people might love it, might hate it,
just weren't paying attention all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention all.
Never considered it. no-- point time, making
Licensed Ill, hip hop music tiny underground thing. no one making hip hop
time thought ever mean anything. not realistic thought.
making really crazy friends, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think, nowadays, fact one can create something and, quote, unquote,
release quickly. can put something onto Twitter Instagram now.
10 seconds now, will get immediate feedback, external feedback,
course, can iterate basis feedback. think
problematic larger opportunity creativity? words, go back
20 years even 15 years, opportunity create certainly still there,
really didn't know going land you, quote, unquote, released it.
seems opportunity stay magical rainforest
creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: don't think wrong right. just information


can use not use use useful way. can make something
put out, people not like it. like, oh, still don't get it. going
got go harder. Like got go harder direction not-- know
saying? like not react away information. can helpful. can helpful
when-- different stories happen time.
making something, idea is. people engage
it, different idea is. like different reason
dislike reason different reason like it. can't
control things. part can control relate
thing make. external information undermines clarity
connection probably bad art guess. again, saying
experience. try make things-- ever tried make something like
something felt like missing fan wanted, nobody making it.
make it, wasn't-- always service love thing. want
something like this.

00:41:27 Finishing Projects; Source & Nature

No one else making one. make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
beautiful, word keeps coming mind almost like compulsion.
Like options ways behave function work life.
something compulsion, yanks us away opportunities, just
enough get back it. talked about, talk
book, notion source. me, again, can't help put neuroscientist
lens this. think source not one brain area function within
brain, touch bodily signals. Like feels right, doesn't?
like tasting two foods, love example. playbook far
vast short term adaptive playbook, like going get point
point B. yet, listen album song, assume there,
point, becomes not strategy development creativity strategy
implementation. Like needs songs going come order--
don't know much music. musician friends always laughing. RICK RUBIN:
not much music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, ordering
sequence melodies, et cetera. point one decide, OK, like


now's time get narrow focus effort? Like got it. run
this. component creative process involves packaging
finishing. part less satisfying you, just part larger
arc? RICK RUBIN: part same. nice. good feeling.
usually good feeling something done. one hand, commitment,
time say done, can keep experimenting
changing it. think, well, maybe tomorrow can make better, not finished.
keep thinking long time, can forever never put
anything. getting point ready sign off good feeling,
allows you-- one things talk book is, difficult thing
do, fun play, fun maybe not best yet. use
whatever next project going motivation finish one working
now. Like working this. spending time thing. really good.
believe can better, thing really want make.
keep tinkering one, never get make one. using projects
impetus finish something release world good one.
said description source something within us. don't know say
accurate. definitely us too, not us. think source
organizing principle everything, everything exists. trees grow,
mountains. anything can see outside world,
every discovery every piece art every new design every machine
outgrowths source energy. part antenna connects it,
maybe vehicle source allow things happen world. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: thank that, indeed misspeak. recall
distinctly book, described physical world constrained
laws physics certain things. imagination unconstrained. think
right, said work set somewhere those, neither one
other. ultimately feeds imagination way, indeed,
brain physical entity. nature outside world provides least
appears near infinite not infinite options. love example color
palette. restrict whatever sorts paints medium have,
restricted. nature, infinite number shades tones
combinations. RICK RUBIN: even one, pick rock look color
rock tried find paint match rock, never match.


much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different
scales, spatial scales, time scales too, spatial scales, delight comes
nature pictures-- seemed like '80s, like
see drop oil shot high resolution. beauty drop oil.
see Earth galaxy, beauty too, extremes.
course, daily perception

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go
different room, can't see model, paint model, instead of--
changes relationship. not just painting lines. painting
interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

work. talk writing book structure
unique. never encountered book kind structure before,
facile read ever, yet every single page, underlined, took notes, starred. like,
notice, worn, very, worn already time.
process removing functions day last week
going order get access this-- going think now
receiver inside you. Right? Almost like tuning radio, [IMITATING STATIC]
comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works
progress spend time listening day looking ideas. stay
far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:
think relationship music, relationship love. didn't listen
get angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: listened
loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: felt loved it,

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value

not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little

got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go

think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick

No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture

lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,
remember got staples stapled him. thought pretty intense.
went saw-- guess called Mexican wrestling. don't know call

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one

Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed

different story. RICK RUBIN: time ever happened?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. field run small cabal people

investment things way now charge. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now

interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,

something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk

way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting

ANDREW HUBERMAN: unhappy happy may not relevant
whether not able stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. say that's--
say able stay present work probably important part it.
feel less issue unless feel gets way feeling
work makes feel. know saying? lot pain
looking piece art, may hard know art makes feel
you're-- big signal body physical pain. sure
people can too, can, even physical pain, can feel it.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, idea transmutation, taking one emotion

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either
engaging mantra, version almost creating trance
ourselves, not unlike listening something go sleep distract


conscious mind participating. overriding talking mind just
sound generating, word, phrase, series phrases. Meta meditation
loving kindness meditation phrases, focused
breath. purpose focused breath not hear self-talk
normally have. single pointed focus exercise described.
version awareness meditation, closing eyes.
whatever noticing-- now, eyes open
eyes closed awareness practice. first thing
feel-- feel little ringing ears. might electronic equipment around
us. don't mean hear sound. like vibration. hear cars passing
distance. see else comes out, can feel feeling chest. can feel
part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.
cases, example awareness meditation, mantra
meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince
give us suggestions one two can link listeners. sure
appreciate. RICK RUBIN: also meditation like practices
involve-- something called surgical series Monroe Institute
used surgery. listen recording. allows body
heal much faster remove trauma goes getting cut open--
traumatic. just listening certain things, can really powerful
effect, heal much faster. remember put surgery.

gave Rick sedative ready go in. don't think gave anything.
like, look numbers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. Yeah, amazingly
powerful practice like anyone can cultivate. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely,
absolutely. no good bad version. really just-- learn technique
show it, works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, love
willing share process. Listen, just want say thank
number things. want thank music created
create want still ongoing, certainly time today sharing
thought process bit goes incredible creative process. want
thank writing book. don't talk feature many books

school today, learned textbook, percentage
information accurate, percentage not? said, maybe half. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Right, asked, consequence that? said,
incalculable, completely agree. asked second time, still came
answer. good sign. Reliability experiment next
good. Yeah. think idea really know things. science,
observed amazing discoveries chance. observed amazing discoveries
incredible bouts hard work. cases, people spending lot time
lab. Like no one walked lab, saw something one day, Nobel Prize
winning discovery fundamental discovery. hanging lab lot. Just


came something didn't expect. Others drilling
toward answer. RICK RUBIN: cases, breakthroughs
happen-- guessing. don't know this-- considering assume information,
discovery true, based everything came it. everything
came wrong, discoveries probably built a-- know
saying? like context, everything happens takes account
context sitting fits context. Maybe context isn't right. knows?
don't know. saying, close things thinking, think
things, lot assumptions go it. new
discoveries essentially built top beliefs, beliefs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: remember-- course, listened Beastie Boys growing up.
didn't? child 90s, the-- Sabotage outgrowth
skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones like girl movies. worlds,
Beastie Boys skateboarding really closely interwoven while. people
know that. people don't. Spike formed bridge, Spike went off
started making bigger movies people watch. just use
example. heard say guys joking around, like
Beastie Boys, like guys hip hop, kind like hardcore scene,
New York, punk rock scene, joke. lot inside jokes.
working together, thought people might love it, might hate it,
just weren't paying attention all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention all.
Never considered it. no-- point time, making
Licensed Ill, hip hop music tiny underground thing. no one making hip hop
time thought ever mean anything. not realistic thought.
making really crazy friends, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think, nowadays, fact one can create something and, quote, unquote,
release quickly. can put something onto Twitter Instagram now.
10 seconds now, will get immediate feedback, external feedback,
course, can iterate basis feedback. think
problematic larger opportunity creativity? words, go back
20 years even 15 years, opportunity create certainly still there,
really didn't know going land you, quote, unquote, released it.
seems opportunity stay magical rainforest
creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: don't think wrong right. just information


can use not use use useful way. can make something
put out, people not like it. like, oh, still don't get it. going
got go harder. Like got go harder direction not-- know
saying? like not react away information. can helpful. can helpful
when-- different stories happen time.
making something, idea is. people engage
it, different idea is. like different reason
dislike reason different reason like it. can't
control things. part can control relate
thing make. external information undermines clarity
connection probably bad art guess. again, saying
experience. try make things-- ever tried make something like
something felt like missing fan wanted, nobody making it.
make it, wasn't-- always service love thing. want
something like this.

00:41:27 Finishing Projects; Source & Nature

No one else making one. make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
beautiful, word keeps coming mind almost like compulsion.
Like options ways behave function work life.
something compulsion, yanks us away opportunities, just
enough get back it. talked about, talk
book, notion source. me, again, can't help put neuroscientist
lens this. think source not one brain area function within
brain, touch bodily signals. Like feels right, doesn't?
like tasting two foods, love example. playbook far
vast short term adaptive playbook, like going get point
point B. yet, listen album song, assume there,
point, becomes not strategy development creativity strategy
implementation. Like needs songs going come order--
don't know much music. musician friends always laughing. RICK RUBIN:
not much music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, ordering
sequence melodies, et cetera. point one decide, OK, like


now's time get narrow focus effort? Like got it. run
this. component creative process involves packaging
finishing. part less satisfying you, just part larger
arc? RICK RUBIN: part same. nice. good feeling.
usually good feeling something done. one hand, commitment,
time say done, can keep experimenting
changing it. think, well, maybe tomorrow can make better, not finished.
keep thinking long time, can forever never put
anything. getting point ready sign off good feeling,
allows you-- one things talk book is, difficult thing
do, fun play, fun maybe not best yet. use
whatever next project going motivation finish one working
now. Like working this. spending time thing. really good.
believe can better, thing really want make.
keep tinkering one, never get make one. using projects
impetus finish something release world good one.
said description source something within us. don't know say
accurate. definitely us too, not us. think source
organizing principle everything, everything exists. trees grow,
mountains. anything can see outside world,
every discovery every piece art every new design every machine
outgrowths source energy. part antenna connects it,
maybe vehicle source allow things happen world. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: thank that, indeed misspeak. recall
distinctly book, described physical world constrained
laws physics certain things. imagination unconstrained. think
right, said work set somewhere those, neither one
other. ultimately feeds imagination way, indeed,
brain physical entity. nature outside world provides least
appears near infinite not infinite options. love example color
palette. restrict whatever sorts paints medium have,
restricted. nature, infinite number shades tones
combinations. RICK RUBIN: even one, pick rock look color
rock tried find paint match rock, never match.


much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different
scales, spatial scales, time scales too, spatial scales, delight comes
nature pictures-- seemed like '80s, like
see drop oil shot high resolution. beauty drop oil.
see Earth galaxy, beauty too, extremes.
course, daily perception

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go
different room, can't see model, paint model, instead of--
changes relationship. not just painting lines. painting
interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

work. talk writing book structure
unique. never encountered book kind structure before,
facile read ever, yet every single page, underlined, took notes, starred. like,
notice, worn, very, worn already time.
process removing functions day last week
going order get access this-- going think now
receiver inside you. Right? Almost like tuning radio, [IMITATING STATIC]
comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works
progress spend time listening day looking ideas. stay
far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:
think relationship music, relationship love. didn't listen

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion

relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.


plays get advice people experience you.
explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not

02:29:42 Public Opinion & Science: Light, Acupuncture & Nutrition

HUBERMAN: raised science principle. literally dictated

scientific great grandparents. deserve it. told no changing

Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed
competitive nature prizes discoveries time. guy
named Mike Merzenich student, Gregg Recanzone showing adult

many reasons textbooks said it. told it.

different story. RICK RUBIN: time ever happened?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. field run small cabal people

investment things way now charge. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now
division National Institutes Health called complementary alternative
health. amazing. NCCIH run woman published on--
interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe
hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right, exactly. Well, landscape nutrition
sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different
areas. Fashion probably people. just not aware are. Music
theirs. sports theirs. science characters. just pro-
wrestling characters different domains taking
way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never
something done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, yeah, interesting area
definitely making headway inside standard academic science medicine

going ask whether not, important happy order create,
certainly lot people unhappy still able create.
listen you, seems really ability pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: unhappy happy may not relevant
whether not able stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. say that's--
say able stay present work probably important part it.
feel less issue unless feel gets way feeling
work makes feel. know saying? lot pain
looking piece art, may hard know art makes feel
you're-- big signal body physical pain. sure
people can too, can, even physical pain, can feel it.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, idea transmutation, taking one emotion

02:48:07 Mantra Meditation, Awareness Meditation

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either
engaging mantra, version almost creating trance
ourselves, not unlike listening something go sleep distract


conscious mind participating. overriding talking mind just
sound generating, word, phrase, series phrases. Meta meditation
loving kindness meditation phrases, focused
breath. purpose focused breath not hear self-talk
normally have. single pointed focus exercise described.
version awareness meditation, closing eyes.
whatever noticing-- now, eyes open
eyes closed awareness practice. first thing
feel-- feel little ringing ears. might electronic equipment around
us. don't mean hear sound. like vibration. hear cars passing
distance. see else comes out, can feel feeling chest. can feel
part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.
cases, example awareness meditation, mantra
meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince
give us suggestions one two can link listeners. sure
appreciate. RICK RUBIN: also meditation like practices
involve-- something called surgical series Monroe Institute

claim special offer, month January, 10 free travel packs, plus year
supply vitamin D3 K2. offline conversation one time, asked good friend
mine, guest podcast, Eddie Chang, chair neurosurgery,
place top 1% neuroscientists. pulling speech people
completely paralyzed locked-in syndrome, et cetera. asked him,
percentage contained medical textbooks training-- RICK RUBIN:
Today ANDREW HUBERMAN: Today. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. went medical
school today, learned textbook, percentage
information accurate, percentage not? said, maybe half. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Right, asked, consequence that? said,
incalculable, completely agree. asked second time, still came
answer. good sign. Reliability experiment next
good. Yeah. think idea really know things. science,
observed amazing discoveries chance. observed amazing discoveries
incredible bouts hard work. cases, people spending lot time
lab. Like no one walked lab, saw something one day, Nobel Prize
winning discovery fundamental discovery. hanging lab lot. Just


came something didn't expect. Others drilling
toward answer. RICK RUBIN: cases, breakthroughs
happen-- guessing. don't know this-- considering assume information,
discovery true, based everything came it. everything
came wrong, discoveries probably built a-- know
saying? like context, everything happens takes account
context sitting fits context. Maybe context isn't right. knows?
don't know. saying, close things thinking, think
things, lot assumptions go it. new
discoveries essentially built top beliefs, beliefs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: remember-- course, listened Beastie Boys growing up.
didn't? child 90s, the-- Sabotage outgrowth
skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones like girl movies. worlds,
Beastie Boys skateboarding really closely interwoven while. people
know that. people don't. Spike formed bridge, Spike went off
started making bigger movies people watch. just use
example. heard say guys joking around, like
Beastie Boys, like guys hip hop, kind like hardcore scene,
New York, punk rock scene, joke. lot inside jokes.
working together, thought people might love it, might hate it,
just weren't paying attention all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention all.
Never considered it. no-- point time, making
Licensed Ill, hip hop music tiny underground thing. no one making hip hop
time thought ever mean anything. not realistic thought.
making really crazy friends, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think, nowadays, fact one can create something and, quote, unquote,
release quickly. can put something onto Twitter Instagram now.
10 seconds now, will get immediate feedback, external feedback,
course, can iterate basis feedback. think
problematic larger opportunity creativity? words, go back
20 years even 15 years, opportunity create certainly still there,
really didn't know going land you, quote, unquote, released it.
seems opportunity stay magical rainforest
creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: don't think wrong right. just information


can use not use use useful way. can make something
put out, people not like it. like, oh, still don't get it. going
got go harder. Like got go harder direction not-- know
saying? like not react away information. can helpful. can helpful
when-- different stories happen time.
making something, idea is. people engage
it, different idea is. like different reason
dislike reason different reason like it. can't
control things. part can control relate
thing make. external information undermines clarity
connection probably bad art guess. again, saying
experience. try make things-- ever tried make something like
something felt like missing fan wanted, nobody making it.
make it, wasn't-- always service love thing. want
something like this.

00:41:27 Finishing Projects; Source & Nature

No one else making one. make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
beautiful, word keeps coming mind almost like compulsion.
Like options ways behave function work life.
something compulsion, yanks us away opportunities, just
enough get back it. talked about, talk
book, notion source. me, again, can't help put neuroscientist
lens this. think source not one brain area function within
brain, touch bodily signals. Like feels right, doesn't?
like tasting two foods, love example. playbook far
vast short term adaptive playbook, like going get point
point B. yet, listen album song, assume there,
point, becomes not strategy development creativity strategy
implementation. Like needs songs going come order--
don't know much music. musician friends always laughing. RICK RUBIN:
not much music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, ordering
sequence melodies, et cetera. point one decide, OK, like


now's time get narrow focus effort? Like got it. run
this. component creative process involves packaging
finishing. part less satisfying you, just part larger
arc? RICK RUBIN: part same. nice. good feeling.
usually good feeling something done. one hand, commitment,
time say done, can keep experimenting
changing it. think, well, maybe tomorrow can make better, not finished.
keep thinking long time, can forever never put
anything. getting point ready sign off good feeling,
allows you-- one things talk book is, difficult thing
do, fun play, fun maybe not best yet. use
whatever next project going motivation finish one working
now. Like working this. spending time thing. really good.
believe can better, thing really want make.
keep tinkering one, never get make one. using projects
impetus finish something release world good one.
said description source something within us. don't know say
accurate. definitely us too, not us. think source
organizing principle everything, everything exists. trees grow,
mountains. anything can see outside world,
every discovery every piece art every new design every machine
outgrowths source energy. part antenna connects it,
maybe vehicle source allow things happen world. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: thank that, indeed misspeak. recall
distinctly book, described physical world constrained
laws physics certain things. imagination unconstrained. think
right, said work set somewhere those, neither one
other. ultimately feeds imagination way, indeed,
brain physical entity. nature outside world provides least
appears near infinite not infinite options. love example color
palette. restrict whatever sorts paints medium have,
restricted. nature, infinite number shades tones
combinations. RICK RUBIN: even one, pick rock look color
rock tried find paint match rock, never match.


much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different
scales, spatial scales, time scales too, spatial scales, delight comes
nature pictures-- seemed like '80s, like
see drop oil shot high resolution. beauty drop oil.
see Earth galaxy, beauty too, extremes.
course, daily perception

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go
different room, can't see model, paint model, instead of--
changes relationship. not just painting lines. painting
interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works

far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook

before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects
nature like clouds ocean, predictability them. know
find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish
things not happen way did, lot living past.
lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,
remember got staples stapled him. thought pretty intense.
went saw-- guess called Mexican wrestling. don't know call
anymore, guys dip hands-- RICK RUBIN: Lucha libre. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, dip hands glass. Sacramento.
saw it. honestly didn't stomach it. really didn't. couldn't believe legal.
might not legal. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thought-

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going

sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying

lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter

acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,

something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe
hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right, exactly. Well, landscape nutrition
sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different

way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either
engaging mantra, version almost creating trance

conscious mind participating. overriding talking mind just
sound generating, word, phrase, series phrases. Meta meditation
loving kindness meditation phrases, focused
breath. purpose focused breath not hear self-talk

version awareness meditation, closing eyes.
whatever noticing-- now, eyes open
eyes closed awareness practice. first thing
feel-- feel little ringing ears. might electronic equipment around

distance. see else comes out, can feel feeling chest. can feel
part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.
cases, example awareness meditation, mantra
meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince
give us suggestions one two can link listeners. sure
appreciate. RICK RUBIN: also meditation like practices
involve-- something called surgical series Monroe Institute

absolutely. no good bad version. really just-- learn technique
show it, works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, love
willing share process. Listen, just want say thank

love book. thank certainly didn't write

came something didn't expect. Others drilling
toward answer. RICK RUBIN: cases, breakthroughs
happen-- guessing. don't know this-- considering assume information,
discovery true, based everything came it. everything
came wrong, discoveries probably built a-- know
saying? like context, everything happens takes account
context sitting fits context. Maybe context isn't right. knows?
don't know. saying, close things thinking, think
things, lot assumptions go it. new
discoveries essentially built top beliefs, beliefs. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: remember-- course, listened Beastie Boys growing up.
didn't? child 90s, the-- Sabotage outgrowth
skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones like girl movies. worlds,
Beastie Boys skateboarding really closely interwoven while. people
know that. people don't. Spike formed bridge, Spike went off
started making bigger movies people watch. just use
example. heard say guys joking around, like
Beastie Boys, like guys hip hop, kind like hardcore scene,
New York, punk rock scene, joke. lot inside jokes.
working together, thought people might love it, might hate it,
just weren't paying attention all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention all.
Never considered it. no-- point time, making
Licensed Ill, hip hop music tiny underground thing. no one making hip hop
time thought ever mean anything. not realistic thought.
making really crazy friends, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think, nowadays, fact one can create something and, quote, unquote,
release quickly. can put something onto Twitter Instagram now.
10 seconds now, will get immediate feedback, external feedback,
course, can iterate basis feedback. think
problematic larger opportunity creativity? words, go back
20 years even 15 years, opportunity create certainly still there,
really didn't know going land you, quote, unquote, released it.
seems opportunity stay magical rainforest
creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: don't think wrong right. just information


can use not use use useful way. can make something
put out, people not like it. like, oh, still don't get it. going
got go harder. Like got go harder direction not-- know
saying? like not react away information. can helpful. can helpful
when-- different stories happen time.
making something, idea is. people engage
it, different idea is. like different reason
dislike reason different reason like it. can't
control things. part can control relate
thing make. external information undermines clarity
connection probably bad art guess. again, saying
experience. try make things-- ever tried make something like
something felt like missing fan wanted, nobody making it.
make it, wasn't-- always service love thing. want
something like this.

00:41:27 Finishing Projects; Source & Nature

No one else making one. make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
beautiful, word keeps coming mind almost like compulsion.
Like options ways behave function work life.
something compulsion, yanks us away opportunities, just
enough get back it. talked about, talk
book, notion source. me, again, can't help put neuroscientist
lens this. think source not one brain area function within
brain, touch bodily signals. Like feels right, doesn't?
like tasting two foods, love example. playbook far
vast short term adaptive playbook, like going get point
point B. yet, listen album song, assume there,
point, becomes not strategy development creativity strategy
implementation. Like needs songs going come order--
don't know much music. musician friends always laughing. RICK RUBIN:
not much music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, ordering
sequence melodies, et cetera. point one decide, OK, like


now's time get narrow focus effort? Like got it. run
this. component creative process involves packaging
finishing. part less satisfying you, just part larger
arc? RICK RUBIN: part same. nice. good feeling.
usually good feeling something done. one hand, commitment,
time say done, can keep experimenting
changing it. think, well, maybe tomorrow can make better, not finished.
keep thinking long time, can forever never put
anything. getting point ready sign off good feeling,
allows you-- one things talk book is, difficult thing
do, fun play, fun maybe not best yet. use
whatever next project going motivation finish one working
now. Like working this. spending time thing. really good.
believe can better, thing really want make.
keep tinkering one, never get make one. using projects
impetus finish something release world good one.
said description source something within us. don't know say
accurate. definitely us too, not us. think source
organizing principle everything, everything exists. trees grow,
mountains. anything can see outside world,
every discovery every piece art every new design every machine
outgrowths source energy. part antenna connects it,
maybe vehicle source allow things happen world. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: thank that, indeed misspeak. recall
distinctly book, described physical world constrained
laws physics certain things. imagination unconstrained. think
right, said work set somewhere those, neither one
other. ultimately feeds imagination way, indeed,
brain physical entity. nature outside world provides least
appears near infinite not infinite options. love example color
palette. restrict whatever sorts paints medium have,
restricted. nature, infinite number shades tones
combinations. RICK RUBIN: even one, pick rock look color
rock tried find paint match rock, never match.


much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different
scales, spatial scales, time scales too, spatial scales, delight comes
nature pictures-- seemed like '80s, like
see drop oil shot high resolution. beauty drop oil.
see Earth galaxy, beauty too, extremes.
course, daily perception

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go
different room, can't see model, paint model, instead of--
changes relationship. not just painting lines. painting
interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

work. talk writing book structure
unique. never encountered book kind structure before,
facile read ever, yet every single page, underlined, took notes, starred. like,
notice, worn, very, worn already time.
process removing functions day last week
going order get access this-- going think now
receiver inside you. Right? Almost like tuning radio, [IMITATING STATIC]
comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works
progress spend time listening day looking ideas. stay
far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:
think relationship music, relationship love. didn't listen
get angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: listened
loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: felt loved it,

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since

got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go

think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal

basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything

RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.


plays get advice people experience you.
explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not
based life experience. based life experience.
stories telling based experiences had,
different data points yours. maybe giving good advice, maybe
giving good advice not giving good advice you.
easy try something result, positive result thinking, everybody can
this. way vegan long time, 22 years. started eating--
started eating animal protein eventually changed diet times
point lost lot weight. way worked me. Right
happened, something told everyone else did,
lost weight, whatever reason, didn't. idea know right
someone else-- think, hard enough even figure right ourselves.
somehow crack code right us, happy it,
still know, wonder way. Maybe even better way
not considering. Not get comfortable thinking

02:29:42 Public Opinion & Science: Light, Acupuncture & Nutrition

know works just get outcome want. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: raised science principle. literally dictated
principle, almost like rule religion, brain plastic. can change
learn 25. critical periods end it.
rule. Essentially, dictated Nobel Prize, deserved, given
scientific great grandparents. deserve it. told no changing
brain structure function meaningful way age 25 so. turns
completely wrong. Sorry David Torsten, knew wrong. RICK RUBIN:
Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed
competitive nature prizes discoveries time. guy
named Mike Merzenich student, Gregg Recanzone showing adult
plasticity exists now really starting emerge theme, just crazy.
many reasons textbooks said it. told it.
changed behavior. Now know completely false. plasticity
throughout lifespan. limits there, just far away


different story. RICK RUBIN: time ever happened?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. field run small cabal people
time. RICK RUBIN: fields run small cabal people
investment things way now charge. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now

acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,

way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never
something done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, yeah, interesting area
definitely making headway inside standard academic science medicine
now. RICK RUBIN: interested non-pharmacological approaches things,
whatever are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, big believer also

clues. Now, feel tempted look exact title chapter. RICK RUBIN:
probably look clues guess. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look clues sounds
like sounds right. since wrote it, guessing right. RICK RUBIN: Well
something like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think clues

sauna-- sauna, really hot. feeling
wanting get bad critters body can't handle it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Like get here. RICK RUBIN: trying convince you,
inside, get out. Maybe feeling compelled get
comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Elon getting us Mars might bit of--
maybe just want get Mars. RICK RUBIN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: starting feel like channeling Lex Freedman
moment. No, think considering opposite really key. might sound
mystical people little bit like just playing ideas, exactly

say, something else? good example might be-- pulling
podcast episodes had. Alia Crum amazing psychologist
works belief effects. knowledge strongly shapes physiological outcome.
amazing graduate thesis said, exercise placebo,
it? Yeah, burn calories things. Turns isn't case.
turns lot effects exercise, positive effects-- lowering blood pressure,
relieving stress, positive placebo nobody thinks like
attached calories burned, et cetera. RICK RUBIN: think big point

power. believe can make something great, chances us making something
great better don't believe can. say, ability harness

hear allows see something didn't see before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going ask whether not, important happy order create,
certainly lot people unhappy still able create.
listen you, seems really ability pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: unhappy happy may not relevant
whether not able stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. say that's--
say able stay present work probably important part it.
feel less issue unless feel gets way feeling
work makes feel. know saying? lot pain
looking piece art, may hard know art makes feel
you're-- big signal body physical pain. sure
people can too, can, even physical pain, can feel it.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, idea transmutation, taking one emotion
contorting co-opting another action adaptive way. idea
distraction problem, really resonates, think. think times great

02:48:07 Mantra Meditation, Awareness Meditation

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either
engaging mantra, version almost creating trance
ourselves, not unlike listening something go sleep distract


conscious mind participating. overriding talking mind just
sound generating, word, phrase, series phrases. Meta meditation
loving kindness meditation phrases, focused
breath. purpose focused breath not hear self-talk
normally have. single pointed focus exercise described.
version awareness meditation, closing eyes.
whatever noticing-- now, eyes open
eyes closed awareness practice. first thing
feel-- feel little ringing ears. might electronic equipment around
us. don't mean hear sound. like vibration. hear cars passing
distance. see else comes out, can feel feeling chest. can feel
part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.
cases, example awareness meditation, mantra
meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince
give us suggestions one two can link listeners. sure
appreciate. RICK RUBIN: also meditation like practices
involve-- something called surgical series Monroe Institute
used surgery. listen recording. allows body
heal much faster remove trauma goes getting cut open--
traumatic. just listening certain things, can really powerful
effect, heal much faster. remember put surgery.
eyes closed. wasn't communicating anyone going
inside. wife me. came in. said, oh, already
gave Rick sedative ready go in. don't think gave anything.
like, look numbers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. Yeah, amazingly
powerful practice like anyone can cultivate. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely,
absolutely. no good bad version. really just-- learn technique
show it, works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, love
willing share process. Listen, just want say thank
number things. want thank music created
create want still ongoing, certainly time today sharing
thought process bit goes incredible creative process. want
thank writing book. don't talk feature many books
podcast. just not something typically do, seen little bit evolution
it. seen now read final form twice, mentioned.
going continue read again. one books
filled gems, like every chapter. take notes this. take notes this.
assembled digestible way allows people extract meaningful
parts every chapter. many way straightforward.
love book. thank certainly didn't write


book. happy did. know already benefited know
many people going benefit. amazing book. couldn't help put
neuroscience lens it. also, halfway through, learned discard pre-
existing lens bit start see things think different perspective.
just want thank incredible portal also
amazing friend. RICK RUBIN: Thank you. love you. happy you.

can use not use use useful way. can make something
put out, people not like it. like, oh, still don't get it. going
got go harder. Like got go harder direction not-- know
saying? like not react away information. can helpful. can helpful
when-- different stories happen time.
making something, idea is. people engage
it, different idea is. like different reason
dislike reason different reason like it. can't
control things. part can control relate
thing make. external information undermines clarity
connection probably bad art guess. again, saying
experience. try make things-- ever tried make something like
something felt like missing fan wanted, nobody making it.
make it, wasn't-- always service love thing. want
something like this.

00:41:27 Finishing Projects; Source & Nature

No one else making one. make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
beautiful, word keeps coming mind almost like compulsion.
Like options ways behave function work life.
something compulsion, yanks us away opportunities, just
enough get back it. talked about, talk
book, notion source. me, again, can't help put neuroscientist
lens this. think source not one brain area function within
brain, touch bodily signals. Like feels right, doesn't?
like tasting two foods, love example. playbook far
vast short term adaptive playbook, like going get point
point B. yet, listen album song, assume there,
point, becomes not strategy development creativity strategy
implementation. Like needs songs going come order--
don't know much music. musician friends always laughing. RICK RUBIN:
not much music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, ordering
sequence melodies, et cetera. point one decide, OK, like


now's time get narrow focus effort? Like got it. run
this. component creative process involves packaging
finishing. part less satisfying you, just part larger
arc? RICK RUBIN: part same. nice. good feeling.
usually good feeling something done. one hand, commitment,
time say done, can keep experimenting
changing it. think, well, maybe tomorrow can make better, not finished.
keep thinking long time, can forever never put
anything. getting point ready sign off good feeling,
allows you-- one things talk book is, difficult thing
do, fun play, fun maybe not best yet. use
whatever next project going motivation finish one working
now. Like working this. spending time thing. really good.
believe can better, thing really want make.
keep tinkering one, never get make one. using projects
impetus finish something release world good one.
said description source something within us. don't know say
accurate. definitely us too, not us. think source
organizing principle everything, everything exists. trees grow,
mountains. anything can see outside world,
every discovery every piece art every new design every machine
outgrowths source energy. part antenna connects it,
maybe vehicle source allow things happen world. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: thank that, indeed misspeak. recall
distinctly book, described physical world constrained
laws physics certain things. imagination unconstrained. think
right, said work set somewhere those, neither one
other. ultimately feeds imagination way, indeed,
brain physical entity. nature outside world provides least
appears near infinite not infinite options. love example color
palette. restrict whatever sorts paints medium have,
restricted. nature, infinite number shades tones
combinations. RICK RUBIN: even one, pick rock look color
rock tried find paint match rock, never match.


much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different
scales, spatial scales, time scales too, spatial scales, delight comes
nature pictures-- seemed like '80s, like
see drop oil shot high resolution. beauty drop oil.
see Earth galaxy, beauty too, extremes.
course, daily perception

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go
different room, can't see model, paint model, instead of--
changes relationship. not just painting lines. painting
interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,

whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,

amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,

now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done

place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:
think relationship music, relationship love. didn't listen
get angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: listened
loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: felt loved it,

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects
nature like clouds ocean, predictability them. know
find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish
things not happen way did, lot living past.
lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,
remember got staples stapled him. thought pretty intense.
went saw-- guess called Mexican wrestling. don't know call
anymore, guys dip hands-- RICK RUBIN: Lucha libre. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, dip hands glass. Sacramento.
saw it. honestly didn't stomach it. really didn't. couldn't believe legal.

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,

yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.

completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.

OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting

RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either

meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right

whatever next project going motivation finish one working
now. Like working this. spending time thing. really good.
believe can better, thing really want make.
keep tinkering one, never get make one. using projects
impetus finish something release world good one.
said description source something within us. don't know say
accurate. definitely us too, not us. think source
organizing principle everything, everything exists. trees grow,
mountains. anything can see outside world,
every discovery every piece art every new design every machine
outgrowths source energy. part antenna connects it,
maybe vehicle source allow things happen world. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: thank that, indeed misspeak. recall
distinctly book, described physical world constrained
laws physics certain things. imagination unconstrained. think
right, said work set somewhere those, neither one
other. ultimately feeds imagination way, indeed,
brain physical entity. nature outside world provides least
appears near infinite not infinite options. love example color
palette. restrict whatever sorts paints medium have,
restricted. nature, infinite number shades tones
combinations. RICK RUBIN: even one, pick rock look color
rock tried find paint match rock, never match.


much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go
different room, can't see model, paint model, instead of--
changes relationship. not just painting lines. painting
interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

not trivial source, amazing gift energy. Right? aren't words
really. Aside daily routines, comes somebody going

work. talk writing book structure
unique. never encountered book kind structure before,
facile read ever, yet every single page, underlined, took notes, starred. like,
notice, worn, very, worn already time.
process removing functions day last week
going order get access this-- going think now
receiver inside you. Right? Almost like tuning radio, [IMITATING STATIC]
comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works
progress spend time listening day looking ideas. stay
far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:
think relationship music, relationship love. didn't listen
get angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: listened
loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: felt loved it,

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since

think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people

basic one. miss New York came in? somebody

RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.


plays get advice people experience you.
explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not
based life experience. based life experience.
stories telling based experiences had,
different data points yours. maybe giving good advice, maybe
giving good advice not giving good advice you.
easy try something result, positive result thinking, everybody can
this. way vegan long time, 22 years. started eating--
started eating animal protein eventually changed diet times
point lost lot weight. way worked me. Right
happened, something told everyone else did,
lost weight, whatever reason, didn't. idea know right
someone else-- think, hard enough even figure right ourselves.
somehow crack code right us, happy it,
still know, wonder way. Maybe even better way
not considering. Not get comfortable thinking

02:29:42 Public Opinion & Science: Light, Acupuncture & Nutrition

know works just get outcome want. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: raised science principle. literally dictated
principle, almost like rule religion, brain plastic. can change
learn 25. critical periods end it.
rule. Essentially, dictated Nobel Prize, deserved, given
scientific great grandparents. deserve it. told no changing
brain structure function meaningful way age 25 so. turns
completely wrong. Sorry David Torsten, knew wrong. RICK RUBIN:
Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed
competitive nature prizes discoveries time. guy
named Mike Merzenich student, Gregg Recanzone showing adult
plasticity exists now really starting emerge theme, just crazy.
many reasons textbooks said it. told it.
changed behavior. Now know completely false. plasticity
throughout lifespan. limits there, just far away


different story. RICK RUBIN: time ever happened?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. field run small cabal people
time. RICK RUBIN: fields run small cabal people
investment things way now charge. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture

OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting

probably look clues guess. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look clues sounds
like sounds right. since wrote it, guessing right. RICK RUBIN: Well
something like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think clues

maybe just want get Mars. RICK RUBIN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: starting feel like channeling Lex Freedman
moment. No, think considering opposite really key. might sound
mystical people little bit like just playing ideas, exactly

say, something else? good example might be-- pulling
podcast episodes had. Alia Crum amazing psychologist
works belief effects. knowledge strongly shapes physiological outcome.
amazing graduate thesis said, exercise placebo,
it? Yeah, burn calories things. Turns isn't case.
turns lot effects exercise, positive effects-- lowering blood pressure,
relieving stress, positive placebo nobody thinks like
attached calories burned, et cetera. RICK RUBIN: think big point

great better don't believe can. say, ability harness

hear allows see something didn't see before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going ask whether not, important happy order create,
certainly lot people unhappy still able create.
listen you, seems really ability pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: unhappy happy may not relevant
whether not able stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. say that's--
say able stay present work probably important part it.
feel less issue unless feel gets way feeling
work makes feel. know saying? lot pain
looking piece art, may hard know art makes feel
you're-- big signal body physical pain. sure
people can too, can, even physical pain, can feel it.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, idea transmutation, taking one emotion
contorting co-opting another action adaptive way. idea
distraction problem, really resonates, think. think times great

02:48:07 Mantra Meditation, Awareness Meditation

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either
engaging mantra, version almost creating trance
ourselves, not unlike listening something go sleep distract


conscious mind participating. overriding talking mind just
sound generating, word, phrase, series phrases. Meta meditation
loving kindness meditation phrases, focused
breath. purpose focused breath not hear self-talk
normally have. single pointed focus exercise described.
version awareness meditation, closing eyes.
whatever noticing-- now, eyes open
eyes closed awareness practice. first thing
feel-- feel little ringing ears. might electronic equipment around
us. don't mean hear sound. like vibration. hear cars passing
distance. see else comes out, can feel feeling chest. can feel
part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.
cases, example awareness meditation, mantra
meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince
give us suggestions one two can link listeners. sure

much. many variations nature within single color rock us get
close. much information. scratch surface. scratching
surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love able peer different
scales, spatial scales, time scales too, spatial scales, delight comes
nature pictures-- seemed like '80s, like
see drop oil shot high resolution. beauty drop oil.
see Earth galaxy, beauty too, extremes.
course, daily perception

00:47:40 Perception Filters, Contrast & Novelty

mostly filter kinds interactions, walls, sometimes outdoors.
brilliant neuroscientist, not surprisingly, Nobel. name
Richard Axel. Columbia University. outrageous personality. Chews
Nicorette nonstop. guys get along great, not Nicorette,
perspective things abstract guy solved-- won
Nobel solving great problem within smell, perception odors tastes.
says everything brain abstraction. Like take
photograph face show you, say, yeah, me. say
moment, call abstract artist. just play game,
never accused artist. three dots squiggly line, say
you. say, well, doesn't look like me, say,
abstraction you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, brain
essentially that, something that. no actual
photograph brain. just bunch neurons playing call
ensemble, like different keys piano. go, Rick, recognize you, Rick Rubin.
everything abstraction, start tinkering parts--
essence science, remove add manipulate. best
example can come Rothko. come example
started off vision science maybe will make sense
everyone, except folks who've blind since birth, can swap something
here. show Rothko, don't tell Rothko, may may
not actually think impressive. depends taste art. Rothko
did, amazing, even don't like Rothkos-- happened to--


removed white high contrast-y stuff. alter color
space, colors look different. people saw dress years
ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough
appropriate wall, saw certain way tapped something fundamental.
think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing
perspective really thrilling. imagine, probably relates
Rothko idea, see something particular angle
magical experience. walk three feet side see different way,
just evaporates. works-- triggers thing us look
just right way. experiment just heard about, heard
day, sounds fascinating, painting teacher recommended. instead
painting-- model room painting model, model
next room. go next room without equipment. don't
equipment, can study model long want. go
different room, can't see model, paint model, instead of--
changes relationship. not just painting lines. painting
interesting enough saw-- data points stuck mind?


string together, get? I-- form get
close whatever experience person was, closest getting
experience person painting might not look like photograph. might
look different really see see. think
Picasso paintings inspired African art, eyes different
levels, may give us information photograph give us. thinking
describing sensation something takes breath
away, see dramatic sunset. Anyone know,
really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,
whale, everybody's really interested whale. know
saying? feelings wonder, get experience them, depending
are. dragonfly bird flies space, things happen.
happen, like confronted mystery world, change
perspective. Normally, don't think whales backyard birds house,
flying freely, happen. things happen, like break us
trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.
way, see whale, delightful, think revealing us extent
whales are-- ocean vast. whole universe there,
blind time. think misperception-- misconception, excuse
me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works

far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:
think relationship music, relationship love. didn't listen
get angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: listened
loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: felt loved it,

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.

need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects
nature like clouds ocean, predictability them. know
find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish
things not happen way did, lot living past.
lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,
remember got staples stapled him. thought pretty intense.
went saw-- guess called Mexican wrestling. don't know call
anymore, guys dip hands-- RICK RUBIN: Lucha libre. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, dip hands glass. Sacramento.
saw it. honestly didn't stomach it. really didn't. couldn't believe legal.
might not legal. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thought-

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else

phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one

won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give

know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood

sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given

elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines

something works, easy fooled believing way

Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed

HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now
division National Institutes Health called complementary alternative
health. amazing. NCCIH run woman published on--
interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe
hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right, exactly. Well, landscape nutrition
sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different
areas. Fashion probably people. just not aware are. Music
theirs. sports theirs. science characters. just pro-

way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never
something done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, yeah, interesting area
definitely making headway inside standard academic science medicine
now. RICK RUBIN: interested non-pharmacological approaches things,

going ask whether not, important happy order create,
certainly lot people unhappy still able create.
listen you, seems really ability pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: unhappy happy may not relevant
whether not able stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. say that's--
say able stay present work probably important part it.
feel less issue unless feel gets way feeling
work makes feel. know saying? lot pain
looking piece art, may hard know art makes feel
you're-- big signal body physical pain. sure
people can too, can, even physical pain, can feel it.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, idea transmutation, taking one emotion

02:48:07 Mantra Meditation, Awareness Meditation

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either
engaging mantra, version almost creating trance
ourselves, not unlike listening something go sleep distract


conscious mind participating. overriding talking mind just
sound generating, word, phrase, series phrases. Meta meditation
loving kindness meditation phrases, focused
breath. purpose focused breath not hear self-talk
normally have. single pointed focus exercise described.
version awareness meditation, closing eyes.
whatever noticing-- now, eyes open
eyes closed awareness practice. first thing
feel-- feel little ringing ears. might electronic equipment around
us. don't mean hear sound. like vibration. hear cars passing
distance. see else comes out, can feel feeling chest. can feel
part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.
cases, example awareness meditation, mantra
meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince
give us suggestions one two can link listeners. sure
appreciate. RICK RUBIN: also meditation like practices
involve-- something called surgical series Monroe Institute
used surgery. listen recording. allows body
heal much faster remove trauma goes getting cut open--
traumatic. just listening certain things, can really powerful
effect, heal much faster. remember put surgery.

gave Rick sedative ready go in. don't think gave anything.
like, look numbers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: love it. Yeah, amazingly
powerful practice like anyone can cultivate. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely,
absolutely. no good bad version. really just-- learn technique
show it, works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, love
willing share process. Listen, just want say thank
number things. want thank music created
create want still ongoing, certainly time today sharing
thought process bit goes incredible creative process. want
thank writing book. don't talk feature many books

going continue read again. one books
filled gems, like every chapter. take notes this. take notes this.
assembled digestible way allows people extract meaningful
parts every chapter. many way straightforward.
love book. thank certainly didn't write


book. happy did. know already benefited know
many people going benefit. amazing book. couldn't help put

ago, orange, gold whatever? little bit phenomenon.
doubt-- fact, willing bet left arm Rothko knew nothing
neuroscience color perception. somehow got place where, no
canvas showing no high contrast paintings large enough

think art science really converge, that, every while,
see something feels amazing enough people-- not just like baggy
pants phenomenon, not just people think cool. something
there, defies language. imagine years life
music creative endeavors, every while, ever
encountered something something fundamental keeps showing different
form? something like almost like rule principle, ever come
about? science, think like reveals something
limitation abstract world. hope made clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly
thought. talked earlier drop oil, photograph drop oil
photograph-- use, side, like Hubble telescope images
vast things high definition. see every day impressive
things, numb them, see time.
look drops oil every day microscope, month now, not find
wonder image. sometimes, novelty not seeing

Rothko idea, see something particular angle

really dramatic sunset, whale, anyone's beach,

trance things happen. like, oh, yeah, birds like
everywhere. just not paying attention. guy coming tap
shoulder. like remember me? am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say
whale example describing revealing us how-- delightful
way-- deficient perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: little bit like Rothko revealing how-- never thought
way moment-- revealing us color normally looks actually, first
all, not way looks. colors think one way, color--
gets biology color vision-- contrast. something next
dictates looks like, origin dress meme whatever call
it. still can't figure exactly meme is. Someone will eventually tell me.

me, delighted see whale. might just delighted
getting hit contrast little recognize time,
way, reminds little bit comedy. watching comedy
lately, sometimes, shock. Sometimes, absolute truth revealed,
times, noticed-- saw Rogen comedy Vulcan


Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

work. talk writing book structure
unique. never encountered book kind structure before,
facile read ever, yet every single page, underlined, took notes, starred. like,
notice, worn, very, worn already time.
process removing functions day last week
going order get access this-- going think now
receiver inside you. Right? Almost like tuning radio, [IMITATING STATIC]
comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works
progress spend time listening day looking ideas. stay
far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.

remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place

watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.

explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not

HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now
division National Institutes Health called complementary alternative
health. amazing. NCCIH run woman published on--
interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe
hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right, exactly. Well, landscape nutrition
sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different
areas. Fashion probably people. just not aware are. Music
theirs. sports theirs. science characters. just pro-
wrestling characters different domains taking
way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never
something done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, yeah, interesting area

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK

think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,

working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project

amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging

now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:
think relationship music, relationship love. didn't listen
get angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: listened
loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: felt loved it,

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little

got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go

think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present

No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song

RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,
remember got staples stapled him. thought pretty intense.

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.


plays get advice people experience you.
explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not
based life experience. based life experience.
stories telling based experiences had,
different data points yours. maybe giving good advice, maybe
giving good advice not giving good advice you.
easy try something result, positive result thinking, everybody can
this. way vegan long time, 22 years. started eating--
started eating animal protein eventually changed diet times
point lost lot weight. way worked me. Right
happened, something told everyone else did,
lost weight, whatever reason, didn't. idea know right
someone else-- think, hard enough even figure right ourselves.
somehow crack code right us, happy it,
still know, wonder way. Maybe even better way
not considering. Not get comfortable thinking

02:29:42 Public Opinion & Science: Light, Acupuncture & Nutrition

know works just get outcome want. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: raised science principle. literally dictated
principle, almost like rule religion, brain plastic. can change
learn 25. critical periods end it.
rule. Essentially, dictated Nobel Prize, deserved, given
scientific great grandparents. deserve it. told no changing
brain structure function meaningful way age 25 so. turns
completely wrong. Sorry David Torsten, knew wrong. RICK RUBIN:
Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed
competitive nature prizes discoveries time. guy
named Mike Merzenich student, Gregg Recanzone showing adult
plasticity exists now really starting emerge theme, just crazy.

yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals

know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter

way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never

Club, Austin, every while. small club,
leading story routine bit, think. Right? bit, everyone knew
going. knew, finally told us, exactly
thought going, hilarious. RICK RUBIN: felt good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: felt amazing, thought moment, like, wait
second, pull off? masterful, normally, thing like
create one story. like scripting out, almost like courtroom lawyer.
kind pull curtain, something different. look
science, neuroscience, brain imaging laughter humor, looked
into, honest, no disrespect people field, pretty lame. lame,
always jarring nature surprise. led us something
that, oh, no, actually going there. Oh, wait, really going there,
anticipation beautiful delivery end. convinced that, based
talking here, something see something,
think that, delight feel experiences
now become, subconscious way, like ha. almost like laughing
perceptual deficit have. almost like laughing little actually know,
said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. that. also
sense community think going go particular way, goes
way. like reinforcement you. like, yeah, saying it, way,
saying together. listening, saying it, together,

00:58:42 Music & Identity, Evolving Tastes

good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think
second. trying think certain music still can evoke powerful
emotions me. seem something special music listen
teenagers. 14 25, seems get routed
nervous system way. Maybe phase life really one
identity crisis. don't find many 40-year-olds, some, wondering like
are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, almost every
young teenager pre-teen like I? defining personality.
always likened that. leaving critical period biology stuff,
think music hear time? much emotionally


tuned? not shut sensors quite much? songs
artists don't matter, individual me. people, will
Beatles something. Now, just really wish Beatles too.
think important? see really terrific. also see
sets one just use nerdy language call like semi-deprived filter.
looking way Stiff Little Fingers track made feel
first time listened it, 15, feeling worthwhile. looking
that, missing stuff. missing Beatles. missing Fleetwood Mac,
never either. like, missing stuff people love
respect really love. never worried it, infinite treasure
trove things love. sometimes wonder whether not life
experience diminished, not allowing range. you've, obviously, worked
huge number different genres music. Punk one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil
Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? sense, list
off, just think much high school, maybe nowadays less so, even
college adult, societally, asked constrain one
groups. didn't know OK love Bob Dylan love punk rock much do,
heard Tim Armstrong said loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: like-- recently, told loves Grateful Dead,
like, whoa. remember pick. RICK RUBIN: Ramones
Clash love Beatles, can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. got work
do. RICK RUBIN: together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN:
feeling part is, reason gets age, time defining
are, music part definition see ourselves. Like
music hear might music radio parents'
music older brother sister's music. 14 15,
start choosing listening to, like, now finally mine. parents
might not like it, older brothers sisters may may not like it, one
mine. always impression us ours. thought
continues last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wipe slate clean then?
instance, going go work somebody new-- again,
people hearing this, hope transplanting whatever
do. realm science podcasting communication, not music,
contour way. Hopefully, podcast will look nothing like


five years. hope, will still core features beauty utility
biology coming through, hope doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK
RUBIN: think it'll evolve evolve. just, truer interests you,
not interested biology way five years, hope not
same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: psychoanalysis real time

going order get access this-- going think now
receiver inside you. Right? Almost like tuning radio, [IMITATING STATIC]
comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works
progress spend time listening day looking ideas. stay
far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:
think relationship music, relationship love. didn't listen
get angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: listened
loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: felt loved it,

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,

brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives

shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something

happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first

HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:

certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman

going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,

knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief

Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,

ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going

general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't

like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light

ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value

kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects
nature like clouds ocean, predictability them. know
find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish
things not happen way did, lot living past.
lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,
remember got staples stapled him. thought pretty intense.
went saw-- guess called Mexican wrestling. don't know call
anymore, guys dip hands-- RICK RUBIN: Lucha libre. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, dip hands glass. Sacramento.
saw it. honestly didn't stomach it. really didn't. couldn't believe legal.
might not legal. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thought-

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,

completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches

saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends

doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match

entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite

making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke

realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person

them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects

find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish

lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,

watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood

sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given

lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,

friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW

OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting

RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either

meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right

unique. never encountered book kind structure before,
facile read ever, yet every single page, underlined, took notes, starred. like,
notice, worn, very, worn already time.
process removing functions day last week
going order get access this-- going think now

comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works
progress spend time listening day looking ideas. stay
far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects
nature like clouds ocean, predictability them. know
find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.

lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals

acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science

OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting

ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation

work. talk writing book structure
unique. never encountered book kind structure before,
facile read ever, yet every single page, underlined, took notes, starred. like,
notice, worn, very, worn already time.
process removing functions day last week
going order get access this-- going think now
receiver inside you. Right? Almost like tuning radio, [IMITATING STATIC]
comes in. Like beginning like Strummer Clash thing. Right? love
radio. Joe loved radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] comes clear,
is. clear static? operational steps
think might generalizable, regardless somebody Africa listening
this. RICK RUBIN: say, engage particular project, whatever is,
dedicate period time, whatever is. Whether 20 minutes
whether five hours, whatever is, total focus, no outside distraction
whatsoever. leave process, best not think it,
away it. don't bring materials me. don't leave studio works
progress spend time listening day looking ideas. stay
far away it, not directly engaging it, possible. best
situations, something else totally engage between. instead
working project five hours, leaving nothing, hoping
engage Project B B, C, D going back project
again, might next day, say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: relates
amazing chapter series writings book, not going describe,
want people find themselves, disengaging, disengaging
process. One question read chapter, saying
now, even though disengaged, believe subconscious
working through? RICK RUBIN: believe so. believe so, think general,
stew problem not way solve problem. think hold problems
lightly-- say problem, starting project, usually
feeling of-- question mark, beginning every project. always anxious
start new project, no idea going happen. never
know. never-- may have, cases, potential backup plan, nothing works,
really try not even that. prefer not that. prefer go maybe calm
enough able show up, there'll idea of, nothing works,


maybe try something like this. anxiety.
wouldn't actual practical use. always sense anxiety,
know, whatever's going happen completely control. Something either
interesting not will appear, going follow wherever goes.
something appears us follow, lot anxiety, even though never
not come. come every time, something it-- also feel
like might expectation going make happen, know
not happening. not works. show ready happen open
whatever find first thread. find thread,
like, OK, a-- thread may lead us anything. lead us
million different directions. something glimmer, not
looking blank page. looking at, OK, beginnings of, say,
map. map don't know takes us, just beginning.
just like, here. map, says here, even can't see
directions, knowing feels OK. get-- usually, again,
usually first day, first couple days, happens. then, really
anxiety-producing situation, can't remember original question.
beginning something completely different. remember asked?
don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, talking
disengaging, subconscious it? talking about, love this.
like process wading thing? revealing now.
think anxiety readiness. think characteristic features anxiety, tends
bit constriction visual field narrow vision.
appropriate, want shed going elsewhere. even
people talk shakes like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety designed
mobilize us not always run away. Rarely talk work
laboratory, one things that-- frankly, didn't discover done
laboratory brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, now Caltech,
can often observe animals humans high states anxiety,
move forward toward goal. always think moving forward like calm
thing, heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like not getting off
back. not leaving the-- giving seat bus Muhammad Ali. bet
experiencing tremendous anxiety, forward tilt. think
anxiety least comfortable forcing stand still.


activating energy, brings word written notebook
extraction lot themes within book talked
before, is-- going sound West Coast woo. mean
seriously can stated, feel like everything energetic. can things
place anger. can things place joy. can things
place delight. like think maturing idea joy delight love
ultimate reservoir energy. lot music like younger
anger thread sadness. RICK RUBIN:
think relationship music, relationship love. didn't listen
get angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: listened
loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: felt loved it,

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.

places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look

unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part

instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,

watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.

explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not

HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now
division National Institutes Health called complementary alternative

interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe

sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different

way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.

everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,

friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,

tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now

interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe

sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.

someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting

amazing graduate thesis said, exercise placebo,
it? Yeah, burn calories things. Turns isn't case.
turns lot effects exercise, positive effects-- lowering blood pressure,
relieving stress, positive placebo nobody thinks like

01:13:22 Collaboration, Art & Rigorous Work

matched time. RICK RUBIN: true
were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: know collaboration,
wonderful chapter collaboration, collaboration, mentioned before,
universe, not others. terms the, especially kind work
done do, comes working artists, wonder-- not
looking gossip stories. never interested gossip. love stories,
not interested gossip. see thread dangling there,
going go this. grab it, like, OK, now little bit
map orientation within map. often wonder, scientists complicated
people. People think boring, actually complicated.
often living one limited rule set prefrontal cortex. get
good getting degrees understanding rules academia playing
rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker rules. get
Richard Axels playful go it, systematic.
known rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? think creative artists musical
artists, think bit zany loose. watch documentary
Ramones, like, wow, chaos. How-- many
brilliant artists, musical artists there, seem chaos inside them,
lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. science too, way,
substance abuse issues personal life issues. How-- since don't 100%


control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know

remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,

unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part

RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.


plays get advice people experience you.
explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not

stories telling based experiences had,
different data points yours. maybe giving good advice, maybe

someone else-- think, hard enough even figure right ourselves.
somehow crack code right us, happy it,
still know, wonder way. Maybe even better way
not considering. Not get comfortable thinking

02:29:42 Public Opinion & Science: Light, Acupuncture & Nutrition

know works just get outcome want. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: raised science principle. literally dictated

learn 25. critical periods end it.

scientific great grandparents. deserve it. told no changing
brain structure function meaningful way age 25 so. turns

Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed
competitive nature prizes discoveries time. guy
named Mike Merzenich student, Gregg Recanzone showing adult

many reasons textbooks said it. told it.

different story. RICK RUBIN: time ever happened?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. field run small cabal people

investment things way now charge. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now
division National Institutes Health called complementary alternative
health. amazing. NCCIH run woman published on--
interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe
hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right, exactly. Well, landscape nutrition
sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different
areas. Fashion probably people. just not aware are. Music
theirs. sports theirs. science characters. just pro-
wrestling characters different domains taking
way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never
something done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, yeah, interesting area
definitely making headway inside standard academic science medicine
now. RICK RUBIN: interested non-pharmacological approaches things,
whatever are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, big believer also

people can too, can, even physical pain, can feel it.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, idea transmutation, taking one emotion

02:48:07 Mantra Meditation, Awareness Meditation

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either
engaging mantra, version almost creating trance
ourselves, not unlike listening something go sleep distract


conscious mind participating. overriding talking mind just
sound generating, word, phrase, series phrases. Meta meditation
loving kindness meditation phrases, focused
breath. purpose focused breath not hear self-talk

version awareness meditation, closing eyes.
whatever noticing-- now, eyes open
eyes closed awareness practice. first thing
feel-- feel little ringing ears. might electronic equipment around

distance. see else comes out, can feel feeling chest. can feel
part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.
cases, example awareness meditation, mantra
meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai

control, need play instruments, sing, et cetera. work people
getting way? Right? think
internal chaos lot artists seem have, think sometimes actually
essential piece creativity picture, can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. don't think essential piece general, certain artists,
it. say, rarely get see chaotic part artists. whatever reason,
rarely show me, them, like comedians know, much
serious looks like see stage.
much it, much focus craft going digging
deep necessarily obvious seeing jump around stage. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: fan boxing, track field boxing, sports nobody really
cares about, now UFC popular. track field is-- little bit like
wrestling. go, people really love it.
talk wrestling little bit, professional wrestling. Floyd Mayweather
obviously colorful character one best records boxing time.
years back, got watching stuff, one sees cars money.
literally call money team, spending,
outrageous stuff. know someone camp actually
sparring partner him, lore it-- closed door sparring
clean ups. lore do-- nowadays, 12, three-minute
rounds minute between, used 15. now, neuroscientists stepped in,
turns lot deaths occurring 12 rounds.
whatever reason, cut off 12 really seemed truncate deaths.
things too. dad apparently cornerman-- someone else
podcast knows me. RICK RUBIN: fascinating.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. kid not wanting disappoint parent correlated
death. get wrong, can come me. case,
guy Floyd's camp said 30 60 minutes sparring,
bringing fresh sparring partners no rest. run three four times per
24 hour cycle, despite critical need sleep. training unbelievably
intense, point just chew out, chew up, destroy training
partners. yet perception see playful him. sounds
similar. Like see often not goes it, people intensely
rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, think, way, psychological perspective,


knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.

HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now

acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,

something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe

sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different

way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting

not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never

knew fighting someone wasn't taking seriously, give
confidence, not good thing, person actually working
really hard, outworking you. know saying?

01:18:26 Process & “Cloud”; Perception & Storytelling

Like psychological perspective, makes sense me. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
keep coming back imagining mind ends
continuum. One fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy
implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, side cloud.
nebulous. Right? word learned colleague mine,
Salk Institute, lab there, studies this.
phenomenon don't want mispronounce, sounds like
something else. correct pronunciation pareidolia, pareidolia
tendency look amorphous shape, like cloud tree, think looks
like something else, ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
man moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
reveals extent brain wants place symbolic filters things,
need this. Right? see walk door, Rick, recognize you. fact,
brain area, called fusiform face gyrus, literally face recognition
area. orientation, just see eyes know
you. phenomenon called propasognosia, people can see faces.
can describe everything face, don't know, instance, JFK
Madonna Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: quite list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite
list, go, Lex. Run office, Lex. Just kidding. hard enough get
respond texts is. filters, taking cloud,
deciding things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
want go drill process little bit deeply, approach project--
everyone meets other, shakes hands. engineers. going sit
down. Everyone knows doing, work professionals.
start going, trying cloud implementation? Like
continuum? forgive like trying surgically go
process way disrupt way. trust
while, no threat that. RICK RUBIN: cloud, exception


aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects
nature like clouds ocean, predictability them. know
find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood

sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given

lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals

know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,

goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW

OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either

probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right

aware go wrong technical side, might-- like something
good happening, might look make sure rolling. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: leap here, momentarily, get back. RICK
RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. feel like-- moment, cloud.
something good starts happening, trigger something me. Like uh-oh, hope
is-- hope really this, don't know ever
again. thought of-- first time real world come
picture something good happening. not lose it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: happens, you-- never studio besides
podcast studio. say, hey, guys, sounded good. that. wait,
let continue? obviously don't want break flow. RICK
RUBIN: never want break flow, happening. Yeah.
something's happening, just sit back watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think resonance, like team engineers people know "It,"
quote, unquote, happening? RICK RUBIN: everyone's paying attention, yes.
everyone's paying attention, usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, thread will
something different expected, maybe not everybody pick it.
might particular-- might particular based taste artist's taste.
someone involvement might say, listen back that. think better
thought. can happen. said several things, like said enough
several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: tend that. Sorry.
Especially you. don't get see nearly often like,
do, confess little bit kid candy shop. RICK RUBIN: wrote
brain tells us stories. talked about, walk in, certain data points, recognize
me, real like looking cloud shorthand. go lives
day everything see, short hand, case me, know me,
shorthand turns right. checks out. something don't know
something not familiar with, something happens, experience something
street. Something happens, doesn't make sense. Something ordinary
happens. first thing doesn't make sense. Then, is, again,
subconscious, unconsciously-- don't know unconscious subconsciously--
without thinking, create story explains just happened, hypothetical
makes OK just happened happened. oh, maybe running
dog ran away, chasing dog. Maybe running. soon


thought might be, relax, now not just guy
running, weird. guy running, oh, probably running dog.
now, register story just made up, without even knowing
making up, happened. later day, someone says, yeah,
see guy running house? like, yeah, chasing dog. saw
that. won't even realize maybe hypothetical story first
possible explanation allowed continue walking. know
saying? whole lives. whole lives reacting things, making story
think may happened, without realizing doing.
living rest lives thing made really happened, never
know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: completely agree. confabulate birth death.
well-observed phenomenon people memory deficits.
sad example everyday typical not-- knows-- sad
not sad example. instance, somebody slight memory deficit, someone
Alzheimer's dementia, find hallway night say,
here? say, oh, going get glass water,
walking away direction make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman
Rushdie, said storytelling species. probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow.


going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili
Peppers caliber, knows. Maybe are. see something,
way relevant tangent recently, don't know it's-- look, even crazy,
super cool. take device amplifies electrical signals coming cactus,
just translate simple rule conversion two three pitches
sound, music comes beautiful, nothing short beautiful.
saw that, teenager thought, know hear whale song, think
beautiful. Like just like cursing whole time? Right?
Maybe like Rogen episode, invites comedian friends
there. knows? Maybe psychoanalytic conversation childhood
traumas. don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide, whale
song beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: decide cactus just
plants. RICK RUBIN: beautiful us, right, beautiful us.
doesn't mean know anything it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right. Yeah.
filters, perceptual filters. can see hear, smell taste
can, brain likes work symbols. tend like match
person whose shoes messed must homeless. couple instances
life saw thought homeless vagrant inside building academic
institution. turned out, accomplished person field. always
cool. Yes, happened Berkeley. Then, thing tend put
symbol-- said perception, symbol representations, memories
entirely confabulated, based already deficient symbol perceptual representation.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: never liked statement
don't know brain works. think know brain works,

01:29:13 Limited Resolution, Considering Inverse

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects
nature like clouds ocean, predictability them. know
find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish
things not happen way did, lot living past.
lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,
remember got staples stapled him. thought pretty intense.
went saw-- guess called Mexican wrestling. don't know call
anymore, guys dip hands-- RICK RUBIN: Lucha libre. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, dip hands glass. Sacramento.
saw it. honestly didn't stomach it. really didn't. couldn't believe legal.
might not legal. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thought-

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one

passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat

elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines

something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.

Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed

HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now

acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe
hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right, exactly. Well, landscape nutrition
sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different

way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either

part face. not sure why. feels like related jaw. car sounds.
aware little feeling warmth. now, say room feels bit warm.
wasn't aware before, wasn't just happening. feel little
itch left shoulder. awareness practice, another kind
meditation just paying attention going on. no story.
no means this. None things. like inventory, almost,
everything comes comes up. period time.

meditation, focusing breath, none thinking. none
concentrating on-- aware sense perceptions awareness one
meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince

HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics drink enough develop something called
Korsakoff syndrome, certain brain area gets messed up. ask
question, like oh, here? will come incredible stories,
sometimes interesting stories, no bearing reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ask name is-- RICK RUBIN:
believe? believe happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 100%
certainty, actually relates lot now better understood controversy
around repressed memories. can, especially young people, can pull
memories things never happened. demonstrated
again. courtrooms know cautious now whole notion
repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: good know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
very, complicated area law, can imagine. tend want
trust victims, understandable reasons. terms accuracy details, two people
different accounts experiences, shown
again. can well laboratory. pretty interesting. again,
selective filtering storytelling, are-- think Salman

going say storytelling machines, great. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. story-- say big five, pick brain function,
limited filters. mantis shrimp sees 67 shades red every one
see. access things don't access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: not, far releasing, albums Red Hot Chili

works limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.

oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person

general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel

even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become

not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects
nature like clouds ocean, predictability them. know
find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish
things not happen way did, lot living past.
lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,
remember got staples stapled him. thought pretty intense.
went saw-- guess called Mexican wrestling. don't know call
anymore, guys dip hands-- RICK RUBIN: Lucha libre. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, dip hands glass. Sacramento.
saw it. honestly didn't stomach it. really didn't. couldn't believe legal.
might not legal. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thought-

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking

completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,

knowing accepting it, seems idea looking nature,
looking outside us, critical. fact, hope won't mind sharing this,


years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got

Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going

ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going

making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke

realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true

incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person

them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one

ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value

kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,

RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion

ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place

first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.


plays get advice people experience you.
explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not

somehow crack code right us, happy it,
still know, wonder way. Maybe even better way
not considering. Not get comfortable thinking

02:29:42 Public Opinion & Science: Light, Acupuncture & Nutrition

know works just get outcome want. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: raised science principle. literally dictated

learn 25. critical periods end it.

scientific great grandparents. deserve it. told no changing
brain structure function meaningful way age 25 so. turns

Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed
competitive nature prizes discoveries time. guy
named Mike Merzenich student, Gregg Recanzone showing adult

many reasons textbooks said it. told it.

different story. RICK RUBIN: time ever happened?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. field run small cabal people
time. RICK RUBIN: fields run small cabal people
investment things way now charge. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy

conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now
division National Institutes Health called complementary alternative
health. amazing. NCCIH run woman published on--
interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe
hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right, exactly. Well, landscape nutrition
sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different

years back, sent something text. kind disbelief
something seen media. like, got wrong. knew
person involved, not good situation them. like, got
wrong, wrote back. said, lies. Back nature, truth. RICK
RUBIN: Wow. wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: wrote down. put
desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: still-- tattoo
forehead, didn't already well-committed memory. know true.
Right? Nature can look it's-- RICK RUBIN: say lies, just
talked ability limited facility see understand see.
Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: based that, leads us
can't know much. know saying? resolution low everything
really just like grasping straws. no idea. no idea,
great power knowing that. think know going
on, chances are, deceived. Not somebody deceiving you,
telling see, don't know. all-- know
saying? made up. Everything know made up. Maybe, maybe
true. brings us pro wrestling. reason pro wrestling closer reality
anything else can watch content. know made up.
know performance. storytelling, everything is, except
think wrestling fake, world real. Wrestling's real, world's fake.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk book-- definitely going
direction. book, talk notion entertaining idea opposite
true. not emerging established fields psychology
making great ground, think, human psyche, Byron Katie's work others.
take statement, start playing statement. poke
authenticity. first heard that, thought, hokey. Right? just words.
realized foolish being, really something.
others too, course, science, exactly do. don't
really ask questions science. forced raise hypotheses try say true
false. Now, limitations approach, certainly. Pure observational studies
incredible terms revealed us, especially medicine.
patient bullet hole certain area brain, don't go say,
oh, hypothesize person will deficit seeing faces. No. person
wandered clinic, go, person sees faces can't make sense


them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects

find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present

happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.

passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat

elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines

something works, easy fooled believing way

lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people

completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.

OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting

RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either

them. reverse-- forensically arrive understanding.
general, go things way, considering opposite might true,
well, little bit, suppose, like seeing whale surface water.
like, well, opposite experience, water, part,
maybe not complete experience life. start seeing inverse time.
want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider inverse time, really relates way
described see colors based contrast. maybe blue blue
relation yellow. blue choice, not considering yellow, blue doesn't
exist. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN:
like, talk night. night, day. no day,
no night. cases, like yin yang. light
shadow always. always another side everything, focus one
aspect. look aspect, chances are, learn something too.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: nervous system not just able this. way
everything. Two experiments just briefly describe. scientific great
grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, force person look
something long period time without moving eyes-- way
can this-- image disappears. normally, eyes making little
microsecods, comparing seeing right next it. Pixel
pixel, pixel pixel, pixel pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't
even use example pressing arm. sitting chairs right now,
said know going level sensation backs
thighs, unaware it. experience pressure smell
room, ever walk smell either good not good, pretty soon, smell
disappears. neurons still firing like sledgehammers bell, become
blind deaf it. nervous system likes habituate value
signal often, stuff comes signal noise
kind jolts us attention awareness. want return attention
awareness, prominent themes book. think, important way,
not just, oh, attention awareness important, also give insight pay
better attention,

01:35:38 Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine



pay awareness understanding people going go
differently, want ask wrestling. growing up,
lived South Cow Palace, wrestling going there. think
back WWF. short stint childhood paid attention to,
particular, Koko B. Ware, guy Macaw? obsessed
tropical birds, come in, put tropical bird thing.
George "The Animal" Steele, guy eat ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:
real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: professor,
played Georgia "The Animal" Steele wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: loved
movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects
nature like clouds ocean, predictability them. know
find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish
things not happen way did, lot living past.
lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,
remember got staples stapled him. thought pretty intense.
went saw-- guess called Mexican wrestling. don't know call
anymore, guys dip hands-- RICK RUBIN: Lucha libre. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, dip hands glass. Sacramento.
saw it. honestly didn't stomach it. really didn't. couldn't believe legal.
might not legal. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thought-

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,

ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. and-- RICK RUBIN: believe professor.
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: really? RICK RUBIN:

movie Wrestler, Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: Mickey Rourke. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah. One reasons liked visited Asbury Park. Isn't
filmed? vacant-- goes visit daughter. vacant
amusement park abandoned amusement park scene really eerie, still
kind haunts little bit. something East Coast fall.
places people normally go just summer, don't
West coast, people East Coast just tougher are. still haunts me.
Great movie. remember watching wrestling, age, think
probably 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, entering puberty, puberty
fundamental landmark development. rapid period aging. also
start change rule set. Like certain people certain kinds
interactions take profoundly different meaning. Right? not just reproductive
competence time, kids, bodies change. rulebook changes
fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: understanding world changes moment.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. moment child understands really sex
got lot stuff see world kind
passively, not passively, sent filter, like something.
changes rule book perception. view age, 11 13, least
unique transition point. gap perceived reality
fiction blurry. captured pretty well movie "Stand Me,"
hanging around campfire night. kid says, think win
fight Superman Mighty Mouse? kid says, like idiot,


Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

Well, much calm form, share something, just like

places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,

unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part

instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people

New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San

basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present

not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish
things not happen way did, lot living past.
lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state

RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way

meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.

HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,

acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter

something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like

someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting

Mighty Mouse cartoon. course Superman win. like me,
11 1/2 12 years old. understanding reality know
changing, not completely crystallized adult form reality. RICK RUBIN:
sounds like really healthy place be, me, like that. Not letting crystallize, think
downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: question
specifically wrestling, really process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: want know whether not watch wrestling allows
access energy state body mind mode thinking
reality, one conceives it, somewhat blurry. number reasons,
fine. energy trying export bring creative process
elsewhere, life? anything possible, dealing archetypes?
doesn't matter Koko B. Ware Randy "Macho Man" Savage, George
"The Animal" Steele lovely Elizabeth. guess watch little bit wrestling.
archetypes, much like Greek myths Bible or-- no disrespect
Bible Greek myths wrestling, matter. Archetypes powerful filter
humans, know limited filter too, people aren't built
like square wave functions. curves contours complexity.
deal relationship wrestling? RICK RUBIN: think maintains
playfulness. Anything possible. expect unexpected time wrestling.
way feeling energy sport no competition. Everyone
working together put best show can. like ballet like
sporting event, great skill involved. one things can
watch really feel relaxed. relaxes me. don't feel like think it. can
just relax enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: brings topic near
dear heart, notion dopamine schedules. never want reduce
everything dopamine, dopamine universal currency delight, pleasure,
motivation seeking. chemicals involved too, beautiful
experiment couple examples use foundation questions
wrestling powerful. people may want use wrestling
endeavor way access creative energy source. Earlier,
talked can train animal press lever three times get reward,
will learn three magic number reward, can switch. takes
little bit training, can switch. can't prime numbers.
can't high abstraction schedules. Humans either. not good figuring


rule set optimal foraging. well enough persist species, least
now, likely not tapping system well could,
know, don't know? one don't know
don't knows. beautiful experiment explored dopamine released
context watching sport watching comedy, believe not. comedy
stuff, every time surprise, kind jarring like ha-ha,
measure people's dopamine output. also brain imaging. game
basketball, beautiful opportunity experimentally. every time one team gets
ball shooting free throws something, going court, either
going end basket, not. Might end free throw line, end
not. found schedule anticipation every time
switch team got it. waiting, waiting, it's, ah.
waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, something
happened looked like going make three-pointer,
somebody basically swatted ball away, went half court shot, like
don't expect often, bigger dopamine release. kind
dopamine thing works. describe wrestling, wonder, don't know
script, not one team gets it, team gets it. don't know
going win. Anything happen said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: availability dopamine surge drip, powerful thing,
completely-- completely reach terms anticipation. don't know
going come, must arrive often enough return 11 hours
week watching. many ways, way starting conceptualize creative
process little bit same. don't know nuggets gold
loose threads are, enough experience-- case, referring
specifically-- know there. people walking room
certain level ability talent create map will form itself, going
voyage. nuggets of-- calling dopamine--
there, knowledge enough get come back
trust process. actually think way described wrestling energy
sport. not whether not move move wins loses.
energy, guessing energy creates observer. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. energy creates me, reality honest is,
world seemingly nothing honest is. again, not people


lying time. little data, make story explain it,
say happened. trusted sources exactly just
described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks
leg. out, leg broken. break leg? don't
know. out. know saying? told broke leg.
always like wonder true? wonder line is. know
scripted and/or predetermined. say, predetermined. don't
know reality isn't, ways, real experience
world, don't really know reality isn't. idea, maybe.
think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't
scandal. know saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything
goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects
nature like clouds ocean, predictability them. know
find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish
things not happen way did, lot living past.
lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,
remember got staples stapled him. thought pretty intense.
went saw-- guess called Mexican wrestling. don't know call

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,

described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,

ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't

goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event

neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,

kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week

Well, much calm form, share something, just like

time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing

places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood

sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.

passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines

something works, easy fooled believing way

lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,

sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like

something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk

someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either
engaging mantra, version almost creating trance

meditations. practice not aware thinking
anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: start meditating often
meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right
dinner regular schedule. find airplane,


might meditate hour. can remember, one time, meditating entire flight
New York LA, just great opportunity deep dive. time passes.
lose track time. don't even know-- like going sleep waking up. don't
feel like eight hours. just time stops. Not always, does,
great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, sent meditations including
one transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. trying
get-- longer longer meditations, always meditated little bit.
meditation practice one starting adopt, maybe convince

described pass gospel teach. maybe true,
maybe not. wrestling, know, maybe true, maybe not. lean towards
not true, really interesting wrestling, maybe one
fun things it, that, sometimes, real life works way story. Like two
wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: real life. RICK RUBIN: Well,
don't know. like never know. like storyline, getting married
getting divorced, best friends turn other. part story,
really happening, do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks

think ways, wrestling's honest legitimate, start idea
fixed. go boxing match, don't go boxing match thinking
fixed. Yet, might be, historically, happened. just something
baseball where-- baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't follow baseball.
know. RICK RUBIN: just big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK
RUBIN: One teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: plays, basically. RICK
RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: call signals the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah. not supposed deprogram the-- deconstruct call signals
team, guess maybe team got caught that. RICK RUBIN: Yes,
team won whatever World Series was. like, wrestling, wouldn't

goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, world really like.
ways, comforting, still mystery like, wow, wonder true
not, never really know. someone gets hurt, really break
back, just going vacation? don't know. never know.
fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: fascinating, feel like certain
people show way surprising not just one direction


directions. Like one thing celebrity come make statement. can
interesting not interesting, depending celebrity statement
delivery. probably going get wrong, terrible pop culture
things, anyway. recall, Lady Gaga showed event
wearing outfit made meat, can't tell life whether not
statement meat meat. Maybe, statement carnivore
diet. Maybe, statement veganism. don't know. RICK RUBIN: maybe
neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: maybe neither, definitely statement
broke norm. said me, OK, creates different rules
breaks boundaries people had. never heard anyone before.
doesn't mean hadn't, never heard anyone before. tend
associate outside current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless crosses
line, case, becomes something else. becomes almost theater sake
theater. telling that, within realm wrestling, theater
goal, level, everybody knows goes arenas, watches it.
RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: everyone agrees kind suspend outside reality say
reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, boo bad guys cheer good guys,
knowing backstage probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except
kids 11, think really real. RICK RUBIN: don't know. don't even know
know.

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects
nature like clouds ocean, predictability them. know
find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish
things not happen way did, lot living past.
lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,
remember got staples stapled him. thought pretty intense.
went saw-- guess called Mexican wrestling. don't know call
anymore, guys dip hands-- RICK RUBIN: Lucha libre. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, dip hands glass. Sacramento.
saw it. honestly didn't stomach it. really didn't. couldn't believe legal.
might not legal. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thought-
-



02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.


plays get advice people experience you.
explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not
based life experience. based life experience.
stories telling based experiences had,
different data points yours. maybe giving good advice, maybe
giving good advice not giving good advice you.
easy try something result, positive result thinking, everybody can
this. way vegan long time, 22 years. started eating--
started eating animal protein eventually changed diet times
point lost lot weight. way worked me. Right
happened, something told everyone else did,
lost weight, whatever reason, didn't. idea know right
someone else-- think, hard enough even figure right ourselves.
somehow crack code right us, happy it,
still know, wonder way. Maybe even better way
not considering. Not get comfortable thinking

02:29:42 Public Opinion & Science: Light, Acupuncture & Nutrition

know works just get outcome want. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: raised science principle. literally dictated
principle, almost like rule religion, brain plastic. can change
learn 25. critical periods end it.
rule. Essentially, dictated Nobel Prize, deserved, given
scientific great grandparents. deserve it. told no changing
brain structure function meaningful way age 25 so. turns
completely wrong. Sorry David Torsten, knew wrong. RICK RUBIN:
Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed
competitive nature prizes discoveries time. guy
named Mike Merzenich student, Gregg Recanzone showing adult
plasticity exists now really starting emerge theme, just crazy.
many reasons textbooks said it. told it.
changed behavior. Now know completely false. plasticity
throughout lifespan. limits there, just far away


different story. RICK RUBIN: time ever happened?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. field run small cabal people
time. RICK RUBIN: fields run small cabal people
investment things way now charge. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science

01:49:43 Wrestling, Style & Performance

not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: person know vocalized
love professional wrestling extent Lars Frederiksen,
rhythm guitar player Rancid loves wrestling. statement-- forgive me,
Lars, getting wrong-- that, grew area South Bay,
no teams. Like now, San Jose Earthquakes,
no football team San Jose. Campbell. no like good teams,
no sports teams, wrestling, where? television set.
didn't a-- like didn't grow organized sports thing. 49ers
road, me, skateboarding, love reason.
actually never really know going happen. no rulebook.


rulebook made up, very-- unique sport, that-- surfing's bit like
too-- that, absolutely maniacal making things look certain way.
not just it. making look good. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching front foot, trends
change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: style.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, style like nebulous thing like fashion
sports. Right. Whereas football, amazing catches. even
like catch, happen know 49er-- catch Super Bowl.
general, like goal get end zone, win game. sure football
players like cringing say this, doesn't matter run ugly, run
fastest. skateboarding, never fly. fact, basically ridiculed
sport. wrestling, same? style wrestling? RICK RUBIN:
performance. charisma people involved. physical ability,
ability talk tell story, charismatic performers are. Whether want
watch them, whether want see win, whether want see lose,
whether interested cheering booing them. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going say reminds opera, operas get released again.
know story ends walk in, listened before.
wrestling seem unique way. real time iteration, least
perspective the-- RICK RUBIN: real time iteration based people
get hurt time. really crazy physical stuff. someone gets hurt,
story change. real life, can't show next week
planned script. alive, lot of--

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-
linearity it. not A, B, C. A, Z, Z, Q. think people try
access psychedelics, didn't seem like good way
regular basis, whereas aquaria, tanks there. book, talk
something also share love for, ocean aspects
nature like clouds ocean, predictability them. know
find them. Fortunately, sun rises sets every day, least
now. can count 100% reliability. yet,
perspective physicists say, chaotic. can't look wave
know exactly foam going roll out. know going roll roll
out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish
things not happen way did, lot living past.
lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,

sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given

everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now

acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,

something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe

OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting

01:52:40 Resetting Energy & Nature; Nostalgia

something interesting unexpected always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, much calm form, share something, just like
perspective it. years, used tool order try access ideas, since
little kid actually, little bit OCD, little bit Tourette's. get
tired, that. strategy implementation oriented. little
kid, needed stuffed animals arranged certain way. LEGOs be-- little
neurotic lot. science much things lot
precision. discovered ultimate reset graduate school


postdoc couldn't make really good agnostic front show, like chaos.
chaos punk rock show reset. release thing.
got energy it. First time saw Transplants play, was, whoa, don't
know going happen. scary. loved it. thing used
time reset ability think structured way without feeling like
overcoming me, maybe even access thing ways accessing
wrestling like stare aquaria. like go aquariums build
aquariums. just sit never know way fish
going go. think going way, sudden turn go
way. completely unpredictable. love aquaria tranquility
lab long time. just adore aquariums non-

out. tides, hear wrestling, think love aquaria.
think love punk rock music, instance, think ocean.
think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present

No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines

something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.

Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed

HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like

something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe

sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different

way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,
brain no sensation. Like we-- RICK RUBIN: wouldn't say focus brain.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--
different types meditation. Either way, say no form meditation
focused brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. glad
disagree. RICK RUBIN: say, things happen. either

meditate now? RICK RUBIN: learned 14. started TM.
probably meditation done life come back to.
Although tried many different kinds also different physical forms meditation-- Tai
Chi, things like that. meditated five six years. stopped went
school, university. started several years later. started
again, realized profound wasn't done usually
sort practice. ways, beach walks form
meditation. me, typically, wake up. It'd first thing
in-between time, maybe go sun, close eyes, meditate
starting day. twice day, second time probably right

think way actually need source things
combination structure no structure. RICK RUBIN: think interesting
places don't change places change lot. can
remember thinking this. walking-- beach walk Hawaii,
walk every morning there. walk beach every
day, get sense like. remember Hawaii. walked
beach every day year however long was. left six months,
came back. next time walked beach, entirely different beach,
entirely different. remember thinking moment like unusual place
pictured house didn't even grow in, house lived maybe
first seven years life. think backyard looked like.
think particular old tree there. don't know sure,


sense is, go back grew up, go place, look
yard, probably look pretty similar. Yet, beach walking
Hawaii course six months completely changed face. just
interesting things are. depending project working on,
able go place know potential change lot
connection Earth experiencing versus going
place little change. can count way always
been. interesting things able draw upon depending
want open psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: almost
unhealthy fascination New York mid '80s '90s. RICK RUBIN: didn't
live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, since kid-- went
little kid. fascinated it. also interesting migration
East Coast West Coast creatives, including yourself, played important part
life just seeing things hearing things meaningful me. I,
instance, love movie-- haven't seen documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Basquiat, characters it, huge number people
like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Wall, on, on. images
New York time exciting happening. wish
transplant that. time machine, land first. hear lot
people say, New York isn't used be. San Francisco isn't used be,
whatever. LA isn't what-- seem something feels little bit disruptive
people cities changing. idea natural landscapes change actually--
even accept like, hey, fires sweep places. assuming weren't started
humans, accept that. change reordering landscapes normal
healthy. always tell myself, kids growing New York, San
Francisco, Chicago now. know way. them, cool
uncool ever going be. either want get loving every piece
it. happened people came us. question
basic one. miss New York came in? somebody
attached past? RICK RUBIN: not attached all. not attached anything
past. don't look back all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think about, oh,
dorm room NYU, Beastie Boys, this. miss-- no. optics forward, present
forward. RICK RUBIN: present forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
process just happens default to? RICK RUBIN: don't know.


not sure, it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia not Rick
Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN:
No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: say genuine admiration. can hear song
maybe role producing not, something past.
accessing state, presumably, not pining wishing was. RICK
RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: no psychologist, going venture
say think unique quality. think lot people wish wish
things not happen way did, lot living past.
lot notion people future trip. don't actually think default state
brain. think lot people live emotional anchors past, good bad. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: watching wrestling one way
cleanse palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: go
meal you-- pass around that-- don't know anymore,
pass around little bit sorbet cleanse palate. turns biological
reason that. kind neutralization taste receptors savory,
sweet, et cetera. wrestling palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: know
watch wrestling go sleep, going good night's sleep. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: dream wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. just
relaxing. just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: anticipate watch it,
like comes dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes
happens exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: going three-pointer. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: enjoy-- RICK
RUBIN: even then, like stakes low. like don't really care
happens, feels good. just entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
actually get hurt sometimes? said do. RICK RUBIN: lot, often. do.
mean, basically stunt men. imagine stuntmen getting hurt crazy stunt.
happens time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: movie Wrestler,
remember got staples stapled him. thought pretty intense.
went saw-- guess called Mexican wrestling. don't know call
anymore, guys dip hands-- RICK RUBIN: Lucha libre. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, dip hands glass. Sacramento.
saw it. honestly didn't stomach it. really didn't. couldn't believe legal.
might not legal. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thought-
-



02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.


plays get advice people experience you.
explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not
based life experience. based life experience.
stories telling based experiences had,
different data points yours. maybe giving good advice, maybe
giving good advice not giving good advice you.
easy try something result, positive result thinking, everybody can
this. way vegan long time, 22 years. started eating--
started eating animal protein eventually changed diet times
point lost lot weight. way worked me. Right
happened, something told everyone else did,
lost weight, whatever reason, didn't. idea know right
someone else-- think, hard enough even figure right ourselves.
somehow crack code right us, happy it,
still know, wonder way. Maybe even better way
not considering. Not get comfortable thinking

02:29:42 Public Opinion & Science: Light, Acupuncture & Nutrition

know works just get outcome want. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: raised science principle. literally dictated
principle, almost like rule religion, brain plastic. can change
learn 25. critical periods end it.
rule. Essentially, dictated Nobel Prize, deserved, given
scientific great grandparents. deserve it. told no changing
brain structure function meaningful way age 25 so. turns
completely wrong. Sorry David Torsten, knew wrong. RICK RUBIN:
Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed
competitive nature prizes discoveries time. guy
named Mike Merzenich student, Gregg Recanzone showing adult
plasticity exists now really starting emerge theme, just crazy.
many reasons textbooks said it. told it.
changed behavior. Now know completely false. plasticity
throughout lifespan. limits there, just far away


different story. RICK RUBIN: time ever happened?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. field run small cabal people
time. RICK RUBIN: fields run small cabal people
investment things way now charge. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now
division National Institutes Health called complementary alternative
health. amazing. NCCIH run woman published on--
interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe
hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right, exactly. Well, landscape nutrition
sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different
areas. Fashion probably people. just not aware are. Music
theirs. sports theirs. science characters. just pro-
wrestling characters different domains taking
way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never
something done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, yeah, interesting area
definitely making headway inside standard academic science medicine
now. RICK RUBIN: interested non-pharmacological approaches things,
whatever are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, big believer also
behavioral do's don'ts, first, fun explore because,
general, unless something like jumping buildings, parkour,
something, time, not going injure harm yourself.

maybe know creative antennae, sources outside.
Strummer said? actually wrote wall laboratory. No input no

probably look clues guess. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look clues sounds
like sounds right. since wrote it, guessing right. RICK RUBIN: Well
something like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think clues

podcast named Justin Sonnenburg. expert gut microbiome.

true principle. talking trillions gut microbiota clearly
amazing things create, neurotransmitters, govern brain, even

sauna-- sauna, really hot. feeling
wanting get bad critters body can't handle it. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Like get here. RICK RUBIN: trying convince you,
inside, get out. Maybe feeling compelled get
comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Elon getting us Mars might bit of--
maybe just want get Mars. RICK RUBIN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: starting feel like channeling Lex Freedman
moment. No, think considering opposite really key. might sound
mystical people little bit like just playing ideas, exactly

podcast episodes had. Alia Crum amazing psychologist
works belief effects. knowledge strongly shapes physiological outcome.
amazing graduate thesis said, exercise placebo,

turns lot effects exercise, positive effects-- lowering blood pressure,

hear allows see something didn't see before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going ask whether not, important happy order create,
certainly lot people unhappy still able create.
listen you, seems really ability pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: unhappy happy may not relevant
whether not able stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. say that's--
say able stay present work probably important part it.
feel less issue unless feel gets way feeling
work makes feel. know saying? lot pain
looking piece art, may hard know art makes feel
you're-- big signal body physical pain. sure
people can too, can, even physical pain, can feel it.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, idea transmutation, taking one emotion
contorting co-opting another action adaptive way. idea
distraction problem, really resonates, think. think times great
productivity able undistracted. also see success can
distraction. often discussed context fighting sports,

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.

90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members

HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood

sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying

like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend

lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals

completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,

making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now

OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.


plays get advice people experience you.
explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not

stories telling based experiences had,
different data points yours. maybe giving good advice, maybe

started eating animal protein eventually changed diet times

lost weight, whatever reason, didn't. idea know right
someone else-- think, hard enough even figure right ourselves.
somehow crack code right us, happy it,
still know, wonder way. Maybe even better way
not considering. Not get comfortable thinking

02:29:42 Public Opinion & Science: Light, Acupuncture & Nutrition

know works just get outcome want. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: raised science principle. literally dictated
principle, almost like rule religion, brain plastic. can change
learn 25. critical periods end it.
rule. Essentially, dictated Nobel Prize, deserved, given
scientific great grandparents. deserve it. told no changing
brain structure function meaningful way age 25 so. turns
completely wrong. Sorry David Torsten, knew wrong. RICK RUBIN:
Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed
competitive nature prizes discoveries time. guy
named Mike Merzenich student, Gregg Recanzone showing adult
plasticity exists now really starting emerge theme, just crazy.
many reasons textbooks said it. told it.
changed behavior. Now know completely false. plasticity
throughout lifespan. limits there, just far away


different story. RICK RUBIN: time ever happened?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. field run small cabal people
time. RICK RUBIN: fields run small cabal people
investment things way now charge. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like

02:01:56 Sleep, Waking & Sunlight, Capturing Ideas

RICK RUBIN: crazy stuff wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
sleep, typically watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: think useful people activity
allows clear mind create peace heading off sleep? RICK
RUBIN: think so. think yoga nidras good. like yoga nidra, pro
wrestling, type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching
Dahmer thing. won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: don't watch horror, anything,
don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, know exists. know horrible
things happen world, certainly don't want sleep. think
liminal states emerging sleep powerful. wake
morning, thoughts immediately structured enjoy clearing
clouds? RICK RUBIN: slow process wake up. like that. like not
engaging much soon. usually fall asleep listening lecture something
speaking don't, can get caught thoughts. listening
something enough focus point stops talking myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: same. grandfather listened radio, sports radio.
fall asleep. Oftentimes, smoker cigarette mouth.
wife's responsibility stay later make sure didn't burn
everything down. wake up, said slow process. hour
two feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: say probably hour. usually
wake try get sun soon possibly can hope spend-- hope
spend hour. usually go walk beach another hour
90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: family members
people time? RICK RUBIN: No, usually focused myself. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: listening something. don't look
phone, listen to, again, lecture, podcast, audiobook. like audiobooks lot.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, too. idea comes mind write down?
RICK RUBIN: may, depends. like to. usually have-- note phone.
don't usually carry pen paper walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, same. long Sunday hike jog. will audio script
phone. People sometimes give funny looks talking myself. RICK


RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.


plays get advice people experience you.
explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not

02:29:42 Public Opinion & Science: Light, Acupuncture & Nutrition

know works just get outcome want. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: raised science principle. literally dictated

learn 25. critical periods end it.

scientific great grandparents. deserve it. told no changing
brain structure function meaningful way age 25 so. turns

Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed
competitive nature prizes discoveries time. guy
named Mike Merzenich student, Gregg Recanzone showing adult

many reasons textbooks said it. told it.

different story. RICK RUBIN: time ever happened?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. field run small cabal people

investment things way now charge. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy

conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.

RUBIN: nice way it, though. like learn audio methods
instead typing methods. Right now type don't think best way.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: voice memos function iPhone phones
really good. now companies like rev.com will turn Word
docs scripts fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. great. actually learned trick Richard
Axel, Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. writes manuscripts
walking around office, pacing, talking phone. RICK RUBIN: always think
Woody Allen movie Alan Alda character talking about-- yeah,
speaking comedy ideas phone. really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, liked movie Harvey Milk, Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,
took place alive, mostly, Bay Area. beautiful
scenes him, recall, sitting kitchen table talking tape recorder
night, talking predicted possibly assassinated, et cetera.
goes back Strummer thing writing things down. think lot
people, including feel little bit egotistical guilt around, think
ideas worthwhile something? think time, come realize
ideas experiments questions health, don't always,
oftentimes can lead real seeds grow big trees. RICK RUBIN:
something interesting you, doesn't matter anyone else thinks.
notes not anyone else's-- anyone else's used. Like hear something
interesting think about, OK, want learn this, whatever
is. then, sometimes things work way things
universe seems work way, rarely learning something idea
using it. learn things idea of, want know.
interesting me. often things interesting can find
way projects just do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
almost like coal kindling, moment think way, sounds
extractive. take walk writing occasional idea, perhaps.
next-- way that-- less than, this, this, that.
interested in, mind shift to? become structured
day goes on? thinking become structured around projects plans?
RICK RUBIN: try deal things need dealing preparation
going work. go work, like free-- free thing


I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,

passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines
can trust, is, think, important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah
something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.


plays get advice people experience you.
explain situation. tell advice. advice giving not

not considering. Not get comfortable thinking

02:29:42 Public Opinion & Science: Light, Acupuncture & Nutrition

HUBERMAN: raised science principle. literally dictated

Wow, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, actively suppressed

different story. RICK RUBIN: time ever happened?
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. field run small cabal people

HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,

friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,

thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter

ANDREW HUBERMAN: focus something normal experience,
that-- define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, different--

I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention,
maybe trying will happen, knowing

02:08:16 Creative Work Phases; Structure & Deadlines

don't ability make happen. can just present ready
arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: surprising found really
interesting useful features book dancing structure lack
structure. think structure, think deadlines.
process creating something, obviously, deadlines relevant, time day.
many hours day one can stay groove readiness
receive. ever found mode grinding like, oh,
are. OK, not coming home dinner. next-- going push, put
coffee pot kind thing. RICK RUBIN: lot. lot. course life, lot,
not much now. one things discovered working book
phases work-- not required treat different phases work
way, whereas before, did. Before, everything state play. Everything
wide open time schedule. happens happens. takes two years
three years, doesn't matter. not that. thing great.
came realize working book different phases.
first phase seed collecting phase, ongoing part life general.
that. always whether working something not. always seed
collecting phase. no deadline just anything interests think
want learn potential something, anything. hear something,
think, uhm, like read that, wonder movie that.
movie that? not, maybe movie made. Again, want--
something want life. see exists. doesn't exist, maybe
something interesting pursue. know desire it.
seed phase, no deadlines. just wide open part. next
phase called experimentation phase, start experimenting see
seeds want do. involved a-- not really dictating
action. setting stage something happen, not yet.
it'd like equivalent plant seed. water it. make
sure sun. wait. involved, can't make grow.


sprouts, grows, turns plant, can look
plants like, OK, plant-- potential plant?
third phase crafting phase, like, OK, plant, maybe going
trim maybe going combine plants make something else
it. Now, like material have. finally completion finishing
phase, final edit, getting version it-- version one
can share world something going do. come
realize time going completion phase, can deadline.
won't hurt project. fact, might help project. didn't know
before. worked projects gone longer necessarily needed
maybe not best interests project didn't know that. didn't
understand timing aware necessity experimental
phase not deadline assumed held whole project.
not-- not clear phase one finishes, start phase two. Phase two
finishes start phase three. move back forth them.
collecting seeds time. always phase one. then, probably
degree, always version experimentation going on, maybe not now,
something's list things want look at, hopefully, get list give
experimentation see can turn into. turn
something, get crafting phase more, OK, now thing.
know thing? can match with? can use for?
can involved craftsman? end crafting phase deep
crafting phase, can start seeing end. can start seeing end.
can even dictate end. recommend, do, just dictate not
anyone else something comes learn-- set deadline,
public deadline, new discovery happens along way. realize, oh,
actually much better thought, need time, harder
set deadline. say, internal deadline get finish it.
said, unusual situation comes better everything not meet
deadline, one rules that-- set rule break best
project. new thing me. helped lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
realize that? RICK RUBIN: collecting material book
thinking it. realized phases-- didn't know this.
started writing book, didn't know hardly things book.


reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.

misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals

completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now

interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe
hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right, exactly. Well, landscape nutrition
sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.

someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never
something done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, yeah, interesting area
definitely making headway inside standard academic science medicine
now. RICK RUBIN: interested non-pharmacological approaches things,
whatever are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, big believer also

maybe just want get Mars. RICK RUBIN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: starting feel like channeling Lex Freedman
moment. No, think considering opposite really key. might sound
mystical people little bit like just playing ideas, exactly
science. Someone walks result says, found this. true.
say, something else? good example might be-- pulling
podcast episodes had. Alia Crum amazing psychologist
works belief effects. knowledge strongly shapes physiological outcome.
amazing graduate thesis said, exercise placebo,
it? Yeah, burn calories things. Turns isn't case.
turns lot effects exercise, positive effects-- lowering blood pressure,
relieving stress, positive placebo nobody thinks like
attached calories burned, et cetera. RICK RUBIN: think big point
belief part huge part conversation everything. believe
power. believe can make something great, chances us making something
great better don't believe can. say, ability harness
belief behalf really healthy thing do. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one thing make clear abilities may come question
time time, absolutely believe elements create
there. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely. elements here. Everything here. get
pick choose. get to-- conveyor belts going little gifts. can-
- first, notice conveyor belt. notice gifts.
starting point. may even feel empowered enough grab one
gifts, open up, see inside. maybe started something

going ask whether not, important happy order create,
certainly lot people unhappy still able create.
listen you, seems really ability pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: unhappy happy may not relevant
whether not able stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. say that's--
say able stay present work probably important part it.
feel less issue unless feel gets way feeling
work makes feel. know saying? lot pain
looking piece art, may hard know art makes feel
you're-- big signal body physical pain. sure
people can too, can, even physical pain, can feel it.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, idea transmutation, taking one emotion
contorting co-opting another action adaptive way. idea
distraction problem, really resonates, think. think times great
productivity able undistracted. also see success can
distraction. often discussed context fighting sports,
someone starts making lot money pretty soon focus becomes things
can access success opposed

thing got first place. Keeping underdog mentality. RICK
RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: conclude, want ask
one aspect process, meditation. Meditation interesting
close eyes meditations done focus brain,

conscious mind participating. overriding talking mind just
sound generating, word, phrase, series phrases. Meta meditation
loving kindness meditation phrases, focused

reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one
terms able make good decisions context,
playbook worked hasn't worked. actually talk this--
passage book that-- just read it. aware assumption
way work best way simply way done before. sat
page almost 10 full minutes, not something often. Maybe
elaborate little bit. mean, want mechanisms routines

something works, easy fooled believing way
right way. just way. just way happened work time.

HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy

Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now
division National Institutes Health called complementary alternative
health. amazing. NCCIH run woman published on--
interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe
hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right, exactly. Well, landscape nutrition
sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different
areas. Fashion probably people. just not aware are. Music
theirs. sports theirs. science characters. just pro-
wrestling characters different domains taking
way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never
something done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, yeah, interesting area
definitely making headway inside standard academic science medicine

reverse engineering something experienced, successful
experience using methods without knowing methods, just following
instincts got something good. look back at, want
that? principle play use outside case?
explain that? book is,

02:15:32 Self-Doubt & Performance

reverse engineered principles led good decision making try make
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: chapter self-doubt really interesting me.
RICK RUBIN: Tell says can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, read first sentence it, self-doubt lives us.
may wish gone, serve us. goes describe dance
self-doubt not many words. think saying actually
landscape psychology, generally discussed pathological context,
is, nothing matters, anything goes. usually phrase used describe people
feel no use living, just go crazy, often self destruct.
light version this, realize, sense creative process seems
something with-- not paying attention outcomes like likes
it, doesn't like it, just you, make rule play, want
delight myself. Well then, anything goes infinite rule set extract
from, least initially. one gets better craft, can imagine self-doubt
goes down. think perception lot people. get better
doing. can land free throws basketball player. can hit home runs
baseball player. can produce platinum albums artist. Self confidence
goes up. Self-doubt goes down. think know number people
successful enough know oftentimes mirror image that,
people feel pressure now got again. RICK RUBIN:
Yes think good comes easily don't apply
yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. self-doubt like
a-- check yourself. can either really helpful can undermine you.
something have. let undermine us, don't make anything
not good. used balancing tool lives, serves great function
really do-- OK confidence world still second


guess, best can be? can doubt-- think phrase book.
can doubt way great work, masterpiece. Sometimes questioning
allows push just accepting, made good. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Yeah, encountered people seem driven self-doubt
need constantly perform perform again, real arrogance. Just
hasn't experience, fortunately. met arrogant people life.
course, never-- psychiatrist admire lot bio-engineer
guest podcast Carl Di Saraf said, never really know people feel.
mean, time, don't even know feel. Again, language
deprived format explaining feelings.

02:19:13 Predictability & Surprise, Authenticity

think somebody feels one way can observe-- another,
observe behavior. sense returning work, just always returning
process, sounds like routine fairly scripted, least now. things
getting touch with-- wrestling, sleep dreaming, ocean,
predictability can access predictable way, seem
lot unpredictability them. ocean completely unpredictable. RICK
RUBIN: also listen lot music don't know. listen lot classical
music, less jazz, lot old music never heard before.
like surprised music. sometimes really catches off guard. shazam
lot hear something like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: ever encountered
music really works well live just not work recording? much
better live recording sort of, meh. don't name names. RICK
RUBIN: don't think so. feel like maybe artists great live
who've never captured well record. Example probably Grateful Dead
good example band feel like albums not strong point.
hear live recordings, really interesting really different other.
part makes Grateful Dead interesting unpredictability.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: confess. sister listened Grateful Dead.
got taken shows younger. that-- called
space? drum solos go hours hours. like
antithesis punk rock shows, songs like 90 120 seconds. remember


thinking, this? this? people know, love Grateful Dead, love
uncertainty drum thing-- think call space. Forgive
deadheads. not enough one get right. RICK RUBIN: looking
something. sometimes find it. find it, feels
exciting not just-- not just following script. like something really
happening. real moment. Something aim studio create real
moments hear them, don't necessarily sound perfect. sound
like something really happened. moment, something happened.
special moment. can feel play again, wouldn't like
that. something really exciting that. really what-- jazz works
well. think of-- bringing jazz mentality types music
really interesting, makes compelling things, hear them,
certain amount of-- really pay attention it. it,
really paying attention. like, don't really know. no music. no map
follow. now working together make something. play not play?
play? really paying attention. can add go start adding
something. someone else added something. like, oh, can't that. like
everyone's just thing, moment experiencing thing can
feel listener. get hear excitement finding it. thrilling
happens. like experience. feel Dead live. play
songs different ways. again, don't know much Dead. newer
listen Dead. Growing up, never listen Dead, probably
heard songs albums thought, doesn't really speak me.
think albums don't really reflect special them. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: think lot shows recorded videotaped-- RICK RUBIN:
fans supported. supported everybody come, everybody tape,
everybody trade tapes. made sense band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
redefined defined-- excuse me, notion followers. mean, people
literally gave lives spent much lives literally driving city city
follow them. RICK RUBIN: not like going city city watch movie
not movie. different every night. changing. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: pretty incredible phenomenon. don't know anything else quite like
except cults. often don't end well. think guy mixed punch
Jonestown Massacre went high school. RICK RUBIN: true? ANDREW


HUBERMAN: think so. RICK RUBIN: amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
sister really good '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. light person.
RICK RUBIN: read Season Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK
RUBIN: San Francisco '60s. great. love it.

02:25:02 Past Experiences, Other’s Opinions

Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: check out. way describe
experiences going time, things emerging time, creative process
way capturing moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
thought beautifully captured analogy gave conveyor belt going
things. think creative process like going land us, going
enter it, going sit chair grit teeth.
Hemingway quote just sit stare page beads blood
form forehead something, maybe him, maybe was-- don't know.
sounds like Bukowski something. Anyway, going get wrong. People tell
comments. Maybe no one said it. dream. love conveyor belt
thing. reminds laboratory, experiments thinking trying
solve one thing, seeing something else, make decision,
like really cool enough drop everything go direction, spend
night, week, career going way? mean, big decisions, given
least far know, going live 100 years less. idea
thoughts experiences past. can draw on, try, make
good decisions-- grab things off conveyor not? hearing you.
starting realize attached past might worst thing one

investment things way now charge. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no

acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like

guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now
division National Institutes Health called complementary alternative
health. amazing. NCCIH run woman published on--
interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk
anything specific related anything maybe something like, don't believe
hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: right, exactly. Well, landscape nutrition
sometimes now place filter professional wrestling. got
vegans, omnivores, carnivore MD. got liver king.
got everything between. translate number different
areas. Fashion probably people. just not aware are. Music
theirs. sports theirs. science characters. just pro-
wrestling characters different domains taking
way seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, all-- don't know anything.
someone idea sounds interesting, try it. doesn't work,
OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
closer something somebody doesn't want know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not big drug guy like big psychedelic craze happening now
happened years. RICK RUBIN: not it. just never
something done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, yeah, interesting area
definitely making headway inside standard academic science medicine
now. RICK RUBIN: interested non-pharmacological approaches things,

chapter, chapter staying open clues lookout
clues. Now, feel tempted look exact title chapter. RICK RUBIN:
probably look clues guess. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look clues sounds
like sounds right. since wrote it, guessing right. RICK RUBIN: Well
something like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think clues

maybe just want get Mars. RICK RUBIN: Maybe. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: starting feel like channeling Lex Freedman
moment. No, think considering opposite really key. might sound
mystical people little bit like just playing ideas, exactly
science. Someone walks result says, found this. true.
say, something else? good example might be-- pulling
podcast episodes had. Alia Crum amazing psychologist
works belief effects. knowledge strongly shapes physiological outcome.
amazing graduate thesis said, exercise placebo,
it? Yeah, burn calories things. Turns isn't case.
turns lot effects exercise, positive effects-- lowering blood pressure,
relieving stress, positive placebo nobody thinks like
attached calories burned, et cetera. RICK RUBIN: think big point
belief part huge part conversation everything. believe
power. believe can make something great, chances us making something
great better don't believe can. say, ability harness
belief behalf really healthy thing do. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
one thing make clear abilities may come question
time time, absolutely believe elements create
there. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely. elements here. Everything here. get
pick choose. get to-- conveyor belts going little gifts. can-
- first, notice conveyor belt. notice gifts.
starting point. may even feel empowered enough grab one
gifts, open up, see inside. maybe started something
really beautiful wouldn't done. Everything make made
always based something see

02:46:25 Attention, Emotion & Art



hear allows see something didn't see before. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
going ask whether not, important happy order create,
certainly lot people unhappy still able create.
listen you, seems really ability pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: unhappy happy may not relevant
whether not able stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. say that's--
say able stay present work probably important part it.
feel less issue unless feel gets way feeling
work makes feel. know saying? lot pain
looking piece art, may hard know art makes feel
you're-- big signal body physical pain. sure
people can too, can, even physical pain, can feel it.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, idea transmutation, taking one emotion
contorting co-opting another action adaptive way. idea
distraction problem, really resonates, think. think times great

HUBERMAN: one great things getting older that-- well, fortunately,
everyone eventually ages. hope that-- David unfortunately passed away.
lovely. Torsten lovely. still alive. say-- think Torsten say,
yeah, little open kind allowing ideas.
think that-- RICK RUBIN: just think years wasted
misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. went beyond
that. BBC specials helped propagate this. one goals
podcast try shed, shine light ideas first seem crazy.
know semi-obsessed health benefits light. hear
stuff like negative ion therapy. sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something
hear Esalen Big Sur. Turns negative ionization therapy
sleep mood based really amazing work Columbia guy named
Michael Terman. Nobel Prize, think 1916, given phototherapy
treatment lupus. idea certain wavelengths light can help treat medical
conditions not new idea. somehow, see red light. not used seeing
red lights except sunsets stoplights. somehow, bothers people
makes feel like-- RICK RUBIN: undermines business model doesn't take
red light consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: was--
co-opted there. place look acupuncture. lot years,
people said, well, acupuncture, like no mechanism, no mechanism, no
mechanism. lab Harvard, guy named Qiufu Ma, reasonably well,
whose laboratory dedicated trying figure biological mechanisms
acupuncture. discovering everyone known thousands years,
incredible effects anti-inflammation, gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN:
friend terrible back problem. suggested see
acupuncturist. went acupuncturist suggested. back problem
completely healed almost instantaneously. asked him, keeping up,
another flare up. like, no. can't go back
acupuncture doesn't work. said, well, saw work you. like, yeah,
no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, got it-- now good science


published premier journals. interesting little bit science
editorial, since like exchange information health things sort,
editorial staff journal dictates gets published doesn't.
premier journals outsized effect media covers. beautiful
thing journal staff now age grew hearing acupuncture,
hypnosis powerful clinical effect done right, yoga nidra similar practices.
tides changing, sometimes like take step back think,
confronted now seems crazy 10 years, kids will the--
kids, will journal editors. like, oh yeah, absolutely.
making putting tuning forks head something like that, like
sound wave therapy. think one adopts stance of-- filter everything
limitations biology, also sociology, way culture
goes, becomes different story. deal that, not just terms health,
terms thinking anything? sounds like don't spend whole lot time
thinking people going think cool not. RICK RUBIN: No, can't.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: punk rocker heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: still there, got you. RICK RUBIN: can't. just know like
don't. know works doesn't. try things.
constantly looking new better solutions anything. wherever come
doesn't matter. come from-- come Stanford come
guy talking street. works, good. doesn't really matter
all. don't hold tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, now
division National Institutes Health called complementary alternative
health. amazing. NCCIH run woman published on--
interesting, anti-cancer effects things like acupuncture, not
acupuncture can cure cancers, real data think lot people, certainly
generation us, just not interested. sheds new light Andrew
Wiles, Paul Stametses, wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,
many. many can look at. mean long time, nutrition just thought
something doesn't matter eat. medicine take what--
food everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food powerful variable.
landscape online nutrition, one third rails anyone like
social media. good job putting posts Twitter
Instagram, day take down, put new one. RICK RUBIN:


don't talk any-- talk about-- talk creative ideas. don't talk

OK try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: empiricist. RICK RUBIN:
Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. something seems interesting
excited it, not try it? try fringy things. like, ways,
unrealistic seems, interesting feel like getting
