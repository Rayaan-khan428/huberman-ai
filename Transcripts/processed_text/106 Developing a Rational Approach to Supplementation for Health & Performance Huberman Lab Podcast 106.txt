advantage mainly focusing taking single ingredient formulations variety
reasons comes foundational supplements mainly talking
supplements contain vitamins minerals designed compensate
deficiencies might diet lack adequate diet
lack vitamin mineral intake arise well instance somebody
practices intermittent fasting components fasting somebody
not get enough vitamins minerals vegetables fruits Grains
meats well taking supplement can act insurance policy
vitamin mineral deficiencies many ways can advantageous although will talk
safety concerns just minutes now want acknowledge
soon talk vitamin mineral supplements Skeptics immediately raise


hands say well vitamin mineral supplements give
expensive urine Skeptics referring fact reality
ingest high levels water-soluble vitamins think vitamin C
vitamins indeed will excrete urine however also case
many people not getting enough water-soluble vitamins foods
also case many people also case ingesting higher
needed amounts water-soluble vitamins provided levels aren't exceedingly
High least say can safe provided levels
ingesting not exceedingly high typical vitamin mineral supplement
indeed going cover gaps deficiencies might arise water-soluble
vitamins food intake reality people getting enough
water-soluble vitamins food paying attention couple
things things simple lay regardless whether not
vegan vegetarian traditional omnivore eating animal-based
plant-based sources grains Etc even pure carnivore strict guess
called Lion diet just meat salt regardless type nutrition
follow will get vitamins minerals get fewer depending
nutritional program follow course depending often
much eat just sort obvious people take vitamin mineral

supplements not taken excess unlikely going

00:21:07 Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule

buildup fat soluble vitamins system going problem
raises specific question need ask want take vitamin
mineral supplement well answer will highly individual really just
need address two things first cost within range can afford
want pay right oftentimes vitamin mineral supplements can quite inexpensive
can quite expensive can see full range ones
pennies per day way many dollars tens dollars per day


reported variations quality sourcing forth not aware
real differences quality water soluble fat soluble vitamins
found less expensive versus expensive vitamin mineral supplements
typically cost scales dosages different vitamins minerals
probably expected expensive obtain source vitamins
minerals tend lower quantities less expensive versions vitamin
mineral supplements just kind obvious need ask can
afford financially need ask able regularly ingest
enough foods enough variety cover vitamin mineral needs just food
people answer going immediate yes careful get
enough foods allow obtain vitamin mineral quota
individuals answer will no say people extremely
physically mentally active people perhaps following intermittent
fasting schedule not ingesting lot food general restricting food
intake specific times day well vitamin mineral supplement likely makes sense
however going important ingest vitamin mineral
supplement food ideally early day can set little bit
challenge intermittent fasters restricting feeding window late
day say well many water-soluble vitamins particular B
vitamins need ingested food otherwise can cause
stomach upset range people like can take B
vitamins empty stomach feel fine people feel really lousy take
B vitamins things talk later namely zinc
coenzyme Q10 really also taken food best time take
vitamin mineral supplement food believe going take
vitamin mineral supplement want take food don't want take
dosages vitamins minerals supplements exceedingly high
couple reasons one buildup fat soluble vitamins talked
reason people tend take high levels vitamins
minerals supplements tend spend less time focus making sure
optimizing nutrition least trying get nutrition right
mean getting nutrition right well think regardless whether not keto
omnivore carnivore vegan nutritional plan key thing get
75 80 Foods non-processed minimally processed


sources think agreement across board people avoid highly
processed foods highly processed foods going foods long ingredient
lists long shelf lives often includes snack foods include
snack foods like chips Etc pastries sit Shelf long time also
includes things like canned soups number different foods many
many ingredients preservatives people well avoid kinds foods

like fruits vegetables notice non-processed foods will tend

00:25:25 Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens

food intake goal health obtaining adequate amounts vitamins
minerals so-called foundational supplements include course vitamin mineral
supplements expanded last decade also include
supplements vitamins minerals also things like digestive enzymes
example indeed can get digestive enzymes
foods instance eating bit papaya even little bit Pineapple can assist
digestion certain aspects macronutrients naturally occurring
enzymes help digest things like carbohydrates fats proteins
food-based sources enzymes welcome look online just put
food based sources enzymes find nowadays lot
foundational supplements will include papain will include different lipases
anytime hear word Ace way means enzyme enzyme designed
break catalyze sort reaction biology nutrition particular
can find foundational supplements include vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes nowadays quality foundational supplements also
including things like adaptogens name adaptogens sort vague
indeed no specific operational definition something really important
understand supplementation companies indeed podcasts can talk


adaptogens without actually defining adaptogen operational way
say operational mean definition everyone given Arena
space research instance can agree talk adaptogenic
effects given compound talking things well foundational
supplements nowadays include vitamins minerals digestive enzymes so-called
adaptogens adaptogens broadly speaking thought improve body
brain's ability ability buffer various stressors things like
herbs like ashwagandha designed reduce cortisol levels sense
ashwagandha adaptogen ashwagandha effects related hormone
augmentation testosterone estrogen maybe even thyroid
Pathways talk little bit later talk supplements
hormone augmentation foundational supplements really expanded include lot
different categories nutrients micronutrients vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes designed achieve broad spectrum effects one category
supplementation think makes

00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition

sense explore multi-ingredient formulations thing often included
so-called foundational supplements probiotics prebiotics
designed augment support so-called gut microbiome gut microbiome
collection trillions little micro bacteria exist us mainly exist
mucous membrane-lined tissues body nasal passages
mouth vagina urethra gut whole way mouth
way end not just stomach trillions bacteria live trillions
microbacteria also live skin fact every time shake someone's hand
exchanging microbacteria micro bacteria often healthy us good us
support huge number positive biological functions microbacteria
live gut Elsewhere mucous line tissues can
disadvantageous us can harm health growing idea days based
number different Laboratories work including laboratory upstairs neighbor
Stanford Dr Justin Sonnenberg guest podcast great
diversity range microbiota called microbiome microbiota
microbacteria essentially referring thing microbiome whole


collection microbacteria lot different so-called species
microbacteria known advantageous immune system function hormone
function supports so-called gut brain axis important number things
including mood motivation actually supports production neurotransmitters
brain body can help keep motivated elevated mood support general
function neurons well not surprisingly ways support gut microbiome
ways harm gut microbiome refer podcast episode
Justin Sonnenberg can find hubermanlab.com want learn
different ways can support gut microbiome sake today's discussion
want emphasize methods supporting gut microbiome
direct consumption particular foods two categories foods
getting enough likely gut microbiome diverse
going support important functions just listed off functions well
two sources gut microbiota supporting foods low sugar fermented foods
things like sauerkraut kimchi Greek yogurt low sugar Greek yogurt
um kombucha particular drink things like kefir bunch varieties
fermented foods different cultures different fermented foods Japanese natto
um another source ferment good gut microbiome work
Justin sonnenberg's lab close Labs Stanford School Medicine
shown people ingest four servings day low sugar fermented foods
greatly improves function gut microbiome particular enhances
function immune system reduces so-called inflammatorium reduces
inflammation brain body ways helpful effective brain
body mental health physical health performance ways
support gut microbiome strictly food come no surprise
people not ingesting four servings day fermented foods hopefully
getting enough fiber especially Prebiotic fiber one way support gut
microbiome although studies Justin sonnenberg's lab point fact fiber
intake not directly supportive gut microbiome everybody
individuals not others no effect individuals
actually made category say array inflammatory markers worse
actually led inflammation not say fiber bad fact
episode Dr Lane Norton discussed many benefits getting
enough fiber lot reasons people get enough fiber diet


least supporting gut microbiome four servings day low sugar fermented
foods seems best way support gut microbiome intake
nutrition people not achieving therefore foundational
supplements can just vitamin mineral supplements vitamin
mineral supplements plus digestive enzymes things plus adaptogens
now also tend include prebiotics probiotics designed support
proliferation maintenance

00:33:06 Supplements Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog

enough gut microbiota order support gut microbiome gut brain axis now
importance gut microbiome people not
getting enough support gut microbiome form low sugar fermented foods
Prebiotic fiber diet think perhaps one essential foundational
supplements irrespective whether not includes vitamins minerals adaptogens
digestive enzymes way support gut microbiome now gets
whole dimension categories Prebiotic probiotic capsules one needs
careful want say Prebiotic probiotic capsules
can buy first expensive best ones going refrigerated
required Refrigeration just good low sugar fermented foods way
instance pickles low sugar fermented food can support gut microbiome
buying pickles section grocery store pickles
not refrigerated well not going get gut microbiome supporting
effects pickles funny even conversation talking
pickles reality can greatly enhance microbiota getting
pickles require refrigeration include brine liquid
around true sauerkraut non-refrigerated sauerkraut not going
support gut microbiome will supply things perhaps not going
support gut microbiome refrigerated versions reason
people not getting enough food based support gut microbiome
importance gut microbiome one key categories
foundational supplements supplements create support microbiome
prebiotics probiotics tend refrigerated varieties
ones actually going work also tend expensive


evidence taking excessive amounts prebiotics probiotics typical
capsule forms prebiotics probiotics taken ongoing not short
periods time taken ongoing can lead issues like brain fog
nice literature growing one suggestion people
going take supplements support microbiome supplements
include low enough levels small enough amounts prebiotics probiotics
don't start venture realm brain fog issues
associated taking much Prebiotic probiotic form

00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs

discovered works best many people find works really well
people approach ask often
often say going take one supplement supplement
take rather just give one specific answer actually asked three
questions first question ask well sleeping night getting
enough sleep waking feeling rested not opens
whole different set interactions need discussions around
sorts things need possibly take order get sleep right
sleep foundation mental health physical health performance will
discussion little bit later episode second question asked
nutrition eating regularly found combination
macronutrients diet right think getting enough vitamins
minerals digestion conversation third thing
ask extremely important budget somebody


ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual
components can take combination order meet foundational
needs people not interested homework legwork
figure exactly dosages one reason indeed taken
athletic green since 2012. like makes feel better energy sleep
better digestion certainly better supports gut microbiome
reason want emphasize great sources
relevant things within foundational formulas athletic greens contains
certainly not route covering foundational Health needs
ways now somebody budget lower hundred dollars per month
spend foundational supplementation well couple discussions
now amount money devote foundational
supplementation zero course respect becomes discussion
sorts foods patterns food intake going best support mental
health physical health performance now somebody somewhere zero
dollars fifty dollars spend supplementation sake thing calling
foundational Health per month well different category supplement discussion
arises moment sort close conversation
foundational supplementation means many different things vitamins
minerals sometimes one vitamin mineral supplement means digestive


enzymes supplement combination vitamins minerals
means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based
mushroom-based formulations can buffer stress provide brain
body support often although not always believe include probiotics
prebiotics anything supports healthy gut microbiome think
broad spectrum supplement many many ingredients high quality covers
bases going best route ensuring foundational supplementation
covered think starting place supplementation
regimens say think covering foundational needs realm
vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes adaptogens going give
benefit cost benefit across board terms brain body
systems going allow feel better overall sleep better overall focus better
overall support different systems brain body going
allow best course also paying careful attention nutrition
simply cannot abandon

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go
newsletter can find toolkit can sign free toolkits like
point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

compounds non-prescription based so-called supplements can
improve hormone function anytime discussing particular aspect mental
health physical health performance need start mention
behavioral tools nutrition-based tools least top Contour coverage
way frames discussion supplementation appropriately
context hormone support augmentation optimization not getting
adequate calories high quality sources hormones like testosterone estrogen
will suffer one reasons women will stop periods
not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin
protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood
glucose well sex hormone binding globulin going increase dramatically
conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way
hormones insulin impact hormones free testosterone
acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases
cortisol levels cortisol levels important elevated early day
focus alertness immune function make sure cortisol levels
low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise
also relatively short meaning hour less bouts intense resistance training
times per week can also dramatically alter hormone profiles fact episode
Dr Duncan French find episode hubermanlab.com
described strenuous still brief two day week protocol using resistance
training specifically increase testosterone free testosterone growth hormone
nutrition matters exercise matters comes increasing supporting
augmenting different hormones just discussion testosterone free
testosterone estrogen also vast discussion thyroid hormone Etc
covered topics previous episodes behavioral
tools place right things avoiding wrong things
right things support hormones avoiding things diminish
hormones ways can detrimental nutrition place support
hormones makes sense turn consider supplements can support
hormones believe want get behaviors nutrition correct
start thinking supplementation hormones repeat get
nutrition behaviors correct sake hormones health
purposes start thinking supplementation hormones certainly


start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

think appropriate fact advantageous multiple ingredients
given supplement throughout rest today's discussion going talk
advantage mainly focusing taking single ingredient formulations variety
reasons comes foundational supplements mainly talking
supplements contain vitamins minerals designed compensate
deficiencies might diet lack adequate diet
lack vitamin mineral intake arise well instance somebody
practices intermittent fasting components fasting somebody
not get enough vitamins minerals vegetables fruits Grains
meats well taking supplement can act insurance policy
vitamin mineral deficiencies many ways can advantageous although will talk
safety concerns just minutes now want acknowledge
soon talk vitamin mineral supplements Skeptics immediately raise


hands say well vitamin mineral supplements give
expensive urine Skeptics referring fact reality
ingest high levels water-soluble vitamins think vitamin C
vitamins indeed will excrete urine however also case
many people not getting enough water-soluble vitamins foods
also case many people also case ingesting higher
needed amounts water-soluble vitamins provided levels aren't exceedingly
High least say can safe provided levels
ingesting not exceedingly high typical vitamin mineral supplement
indeed going cover gaps deficiencies might arise water-soluble
vitamins food intake reality people getting enough
water-soluble vitamins food paying attention couple
things things simple lay regardless whether not
vegan vegetarian traditional omnivore eating animal-based
plant-based sources grains Etc even pure carnivore strict guess
called Lion diet just meat salt regardless type nutrition
follow will get vitamins minerals get fewer depending
nutritional program follow course depending often
much eat just sort obvious people take vitamin mineral

00:21:07 Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule

buildup fat soluble vitamins system going problem
raises specific question need ask want take vitamin
mineral supplement well answer will highly individual really just
need address two things first cost within range can afford
want pay right oftentimes vitamin mineral supplements can quite inexpensive
can quite expensive can see full range ones
pennies per day way many dollars tens dollars per day


reported variations quality sourcing forth not aware
real differences quality water soluble fat soluble vitamins
found less expensive versus expensive vitamin mineral supplements
typically cost scales dosages different vitamins minerals
probably expected expensive obtain source vitamins
minerals tend lower quantities less expensive versions vitamin
mineral supplements just kind obvious need ask can
afford financially need ask able regularly ingest
enough foods enough variety cover vitamin mineral needs just food
people answer going immediate yes careful get
enough foods allow obtain vitamin mineral quota
individuals answer will no say people extremely
physically mentally active people perhaps following intermittent
fasting schedule not ingesting lot food general restricting food
intake specific times day well vitamin mineral supplement likely makes sense
however going important ingest vitamin mineral
supplement food ideally early day can set little bit
challenge intermittent fasters restricting feeding window late
day say well many water-soluble vitamins particular B
vitamins need ingested food otherwise can cause
stomach upset range people like can take B
vitamins empty stomach feel fine people feel really lousy take
B vitamins things talk later namely zinc
coenzyme Q10 really also taken food best time take
vitamin mineral supplement food believe going take
vitamin mineral supplement want take food don't want take
dosages vitamins minerals supplements exceedingly high
couple reasons one buildup fat soluble vitamins talked
reason people tend take high levels vitamins
minerals supplements tend spend less time focus making sure
optimizing nutrition least trying get nutrition right
mean getting nutrition right well think regardless whether not keto
omnivore carnivore vegan nutritional plan key thing get

00:25:25 Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens

food intake goal health obtaining adequate amounts vitamins
minerals so-called foundational supplements include course vitamin mineral
supplements expanded last decade also include
supplements vitamins minerals also things like digestive enzymes
example indeed can get digestive enzymes
foods instance eating bit papaya even little bit Pineapple can assist
digestion certain aspects macronutrients naturally occurring
enzymes help digest things like carbohydrates fats proteins
food-based sources enzymes welcome look online just put
food based sources enzymes find nowadays lot
foundational supplements will include papain will include different lipases
anytime hear word Ace way means enzyme enzyme designed
break catalyze sort reaction biology nutrition particular
can find foundational supplements include vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes nowadays quality foundational supplements also
including things like adaptogens name adaptogens sort vague
indeed no specific operational definition something really important
understand supplementation companies indeed podcasts can talk


adaptogens without actually defining adaptogen operational way
say operational mean definition everyone given Arena
space research instance can agree talk adaptogenic
effects given compound talking things well foundational
supplements nowadays include vitamins minerals digestive enzymes so-called
adaptogens adaptogens broadly speaking thought improve body
brain's ability ability buffer various stressors things like
herbs like ashwagandha designed reduce cortisol levels sense
ashwagandha adaptogen ashwagandha effects related hormone
augmentation testosterone estrogen maybe even thyroid
Pathways talk little bit later talk supplements
hormone augmentation foundational supplements really expanded include lot
different categories nutrients micronutrients vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes designed achieve broad spectrum effects one category
supplementation think makes

00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition

sense explore multi-ingredient formulations thing often included
so-called foundational supplements probiotics prebiotics
designed augment support so-called gut microbiome gut microbiome
collection trillions little micro bacteria exist us mainly exist
mucous membrane-lined tissues body nasal passages
mouth vagina urethra gut whole way mouth
way end not just stomach trillions bacteria live trillions
microbacteria also live skin fact every time shake someone's hand
exchanging microbacteria micro bacteria often healthy us good us
support huge number positive biological functions microbacteria
live gut Elsewhere mucous line tissues can
disadvantageous us can harm health growing idea days based
number different Laboratories work including laboratory upstairs neighbor
Stanford Dr Justin Sonnenberg guest podcast great
diversity range microbiota called microbiome microbiota
microbacteria essentially referring thing microbiome whole


collection microbacteria lot different so-called species
microbacteria known advantageous immune system function hormone
function supports so-called gut brain axis important number things
including mood motivation actually supports production neurotransmitters
brain body can help keep motivated elevated mood support general
function neurons well not surprisingly ways support gut microbiome
ways harm gut microbiome refer podcast episode
Justin Sonnenberg can find hubermanlab.com want learn
different ways can support gut microbiome sake today's discussion
want emphasize methods supporting gut microbiome
direct consumption particular foods two categories foods
getting enough likely gut microbiome diverse
going support important functions just listed off functions well
two sources gut microbiota supporting foods low sugar fermented foods
things like sauerkraut kimchi Greek yogurt low sugar Greek yogurt
um kombucha particular drink things like kefir bunch varieties
fermented foods different cultures different fermented foods Japanese natto
um another source ferment good gut microbiome work
Justin sonnenberg's lab close Labs Stanford School Medicine
shown people ingest four servings day low sugar fermented foods
greatly improves function gut microbiome particular enhances
function immune system reduces so-called inflammatorium reduces
inflammation brain body ways helpful effective brain
body mental health physical health performance ways
support gut microbiome strictly food come no surprise
people not ingesting four servings day fermented foods hopefully
getting enough fiber especially Prebiotic fiber one way support gut
microbiome although studies Justin sonnenberg's lab point fact fiber
intake not directly supportive gut microbiome everybody
individuals not others no effect individuals
actually made category say array inflammatory markers worse
actually led inflammation not say fiber bad fact
episode Dr Lane Norton discussed many benefits getting
enough fiber lot reasons people get enough fiber diet


least supporting gut microbiome four servings day low sugar fermented
foods seems best way support gut microbiome intake
nutrition people not achieving therefore foundational
supplements can just vitamin mineral supplements vitamin
mineral supplements plus digestive enzymes things plus adaptogens
now also tend include prebiotics probiotics designed support
proliferation maintenance

00:33:06 Supplements Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog

enough gut microbiota order support gut microbiome gut brain axis now
importance gut microbiome people not
getting enough support gut microbiome form low sugar fermented foods
Prebiotic fiber diet think perhaps one essential foundational
supplements irrespective whether not includes vitamins minerals adaptogens
digestive enzymes way support gut microbiome now gets
whole dimension categories Prebiotic probiotic capsules one needs
careful want say Prebiotic probiotic capsules
can buy first expensive best ones going refrigerated
required Refrigeration just good low sugar fermented foods way
instance pickles low sugar fermented food can support gut microbiome
buying pickles section grocery store pickles
not refrigerated well not going get gut microbiome supporting
effects pickles funny even conversation talking
pickles reality can greatly enhance microbiota getting
pickles require refrigeration include brine liquid
around true sauerkraut non-refrigerated sauerkraut not going
support gut microbiome will supply things perhaps not going
support gut microbiome refrigerated versions reason
people not getting enough food based support gut microbiome
importance gut microbiome one key categories
foundational supplements supplements create support microbiome
prebiotics probiotics tend refrigerated varieties
ones actually going work also tend expensive


evidence taking excessive amounts prebiotics probiotics typical
capsule forms prebiotics probiotics taken ongoing not short
periods time taken ongoing can lead issues like brain fog
nice literature growing one suggestion people
going take supplements support microbiome supplements
include low enough levels small enough amounts prebiotics probiotics
don't start venture realm brain fog issues
associated taking much Prebiotic probiotic form

00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs

discovered works best many people find works really well
people approach ask often
often say going take one supplement supplement
take rather just give one specific answer actually asked three
questions first question ask well sleeping night getting
enough sleep waking feeling rested not opens
whole different set interactions need discussions around
sorts things need possibly take order get sleep right
sleep foundation mental health physical health performance will
discussion little bit later episode second question asked
nutrition eating regularly found combination
macronutrients diet right think getting enough vitamins
minerals digestion conversation third thing
ask extremely important budget somebody


ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual
components can take combination order meet foundational
needs people not interested homework legwork
figure exactly dosages one reason indeed taken
athletic green since 2012. like makes feel better energy sleep
better digestion certainly better supports gut microbiome
reason want emphasize great sources
relevant things within foundational formulas athletic greens contains
certainly not route covering foundational Health needs
ways now somebody budget lower hundred dollars per month
spend foundational supplementation well couple discussions
now amount money devote foundational
supplementation zero course respect becomes discussion
sorts foods patterns food intake going best support mental
health physical health performance now somebody somewhere zero
dollars fifty dollars spend supplementation sake thing calling
foundational Health per month well different category supplement discussion
arises moment sort close conversation
foundational supplementation means many different things vitamins
minerals sometimes one vitamin mineral supplement means digestive


enzymes supplement combination vitamins minerals
means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based
mushroom-based formulations can buffer stress provide brain
body support often although not always believe include probiotics
prebiotics anything supports healthy gut microbiome think
broad spectrum supplement many many ingredients high quality covers
bases going best route ensuring foundational supplementation
covered think starting place supplementation
regimens say think covering foundational needs realm
vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes adaptogens going give
benefit cost benefit across board terms brain body
systems going allow feel better overall sleep better overall focus better
overall support different systems brain body going
allow best course also paying careful attention nutrition
simply cannot abandon

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go
newsletter can find toolkit can sign free toolkits like
point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

reasons comes foundational supplements mainly talking
supplements contain vitamins minerals designed compensate
deficiencies might diet lack adequate diet
lack vitamin mineral intake arise well instance somebody

not get enough vitamins minerals vegetables fruits Grains
meats well taking supplement can act insurance policy
vitamin mineral deficiencies many ways can advantageous although will talk
safety concerns just minutes now want acknowledge
soon talk vitamin mineral supplements Skeptics immediately raise


hands say well vitamin mineral supplements give
expensive urine Skeptics referring fact reality
ingest high levels water-soluble vitamins think vitamin C
vitamins indeed will excrete urine however also case
many people not getting enough water-soluble vitamins foods
also case many people also case ingesting higher
needed amounts water-soluble vitamins provided levels aren't exceedingly
High least say can safe provided levels
ingesting not exceedingly high typical vitamin mineral supplement
indeed going cover gaps deficiencies might arise water-soluble
vitamins food intake reality people getting enough
water-soluble vitamins food paying attention couple
things things simple lay regardless whether not

soluble vitamins Skeptics will raise hands say not
want take high levels fat soluble vitamins will stored
system potentially levels dangerous provided vitamin mineral
supplements not taken excess unlikely going

00:21:07 Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule

buildup fat soluble vitamins system going problem
raises specific question need ask want take vitamin
mineral supplement well answer will highly individual really just
need address two things first cost within range can afford
want pay right oftentimes vitamin mineral supplements can quite inexpensive
can quite expensive can see full range ones
pennies per day way many dollars tens dollars per day


reported variations quality sourcing forth not aware
real differences quality water soluble fat soluble vitamins
found less expensive versus expensive vitamin mineral supplements
typically cost scales dosages different vitamins minerals
probably expected expensive obtain source vitamins
minerals tend lower quantities less expensive versions vitamin
mineral supplements just kind obvious need ask can
afford financially need ask able regularly ingest
enough foods enough variety cover vitamin mineral needs just food
people answer going immediate yes careful get
enough foods allow obtain vitamin mineral quota
individuals answer will no say people extremely
physically mentally active people perhaps following intermittent
fasting schedule not ingesting lot food general restricting food
intake specific times day well vitamin mineral supplement likely makes sense
however going important ingest vitamin mineral
supplement food ideally early day can set little bit
challenge intermittent fasters restricting feeding window late
day say well many water-soluble vitamins particular B
vitamins need ingested food otherwise can cause
stomach upset range people like can take B
vitamins empty stomach feel fine people feel really lousy take
B vitamins things talk later namely zinc
coenzyme Q10 really also taken food best time take
vitamin mineral supplement food believe going take
vitamin mineral supplement want take food don't want take
dosages vitamins minerals supplements exceedingly high
couple reasons one buildup fat soluble vitamins talked
reason people tend take high levels vitamins
minerals supplements tend spend less time focus making sure
optimizing nutrition least trying get nutrition right
mean getting nutrition right well think regardless whether not keto
omnivore carnivore vegan nutritional plan key thing get
75 80 Foods non-processed minimally processed


sources think agreement across board people avoid highly
processed foods highly processed foods going foods long ingredient
lists long shelf lives often includes snack foods include
snack foods like chips Etc pastries sit Shelf long time also
includes things like canned soups number different foods many
many ingredients preservatives people well avoid kinds foods
focus intake things non-processed things
like fruits vegetables notice non-processed foods will tend
short shelf life require refrigeration cases meat eggs Etc
minimally processed foods know rice oatmeals pastas beans
things sort beans oftentimes can completely unprocessed well course
two general categories unprocessed minimally process make
80

00:25:25 Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens

food intake goal health obtaining adequate amounts vitamins
minerals so-called foundational supplements include course vitamin mineral
supplements expanded last decade also include
supplements vitamins minerals also things like digestive enzymes
example indeed can get digestive enzymes
foods instance eating bit papaya even little bit Pineapple can assist
digestion certain aspects macronutrients naturally occurring
enzymes help digest things like carbohydrates fats proteins
food-based sources enzymes welcome look online just put
food based sources enzymes find nowadays lot
foundational supplements will include papain will include different lipases
anytime hear word Ace way means enzyme enzyme designed
break catalyze sort reaction biology nutrition particular
can find foundational supplements include vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes nowadays quality foundational supplements also
including things like adaptogens name adaptogens sort vague
indeed no specific operational definition something really important
understand supplementation companies indeed podcasts can talk


adaptogens without actually defining adaptogen operational way
say operational mean definition everyone given Arena
space research instance can agree talk adaptogenic
effects given compound talking things well foundational
supplements nowadays include vitamins minerals digestive enzymes so-called
adaptogens adaptogens broadly speaking thought improve body
brain's ability ability buffer various stressors things like
herbs like ashwagandha designed reduce cortisol levels sense
ashwagandha adaptogen ashwagandha effects related hormone
augmentation testosterone estrogen maybe even thyroid
Pathways talk little bit later talk supplements
hormone augmentation foundational supplements really expanded include lot
different categories nutrients micronutrients vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes designed achieve broad spectrum effects one category
supplementation think makes

00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition

sense explore multi-ingredient formulations thing often included
so-called foundational supplements probiotics prebiotics
designed augment support so-called gut microbiome gut microbiome
collection trillions little micro bacteria exist us mainly exist
mucous membrane-lined tissues body nasal passages
mouth vagina urethra gut whole way mouth
way end not just stomach trillions bacteria live trillions
microbacteria also live skin fact every time shake someone's hand
exchanging microbacteria micro bacteria often healthy us good us
support huge number positive biological functions microbacteria
live gut Elsewhere mucous line tissues can
disadvantageous us can harm health growing idea days based
number different Laboratories work including laboratory upstairs neighbor
Stanford Dr Justin Sonnenberg guest podcast great
diversity range microbiota called microbiome microbiota
microbacteria essentially referring thing microbiome whole


collection microbacteria lot different so-called species
microbacteria known advantageous immune system function hormone
function supports so-called gut brain axis important number things
including mood motivation actually supports production neurotransmitters
brain body can help keep motivated elevated mood support general
function neurons well not surprisingly ways support gut microbiome
ways harm gut microbiome refer podcast episode
Justin Sonnenberg can find hubermanlab.com want learn
different ways can support gut microbiome sake today's discussion
want emphasize methods supporting gut microbiome
direct consumption particular foods two categories foods
getting enough likely gut microbiome diverse
going support important functions just listed off functions well
two sources gut microbiota supporting foods low sugar fermented foods
things like sauerkraut kimchi Greek yogurt low sugar Greek yogurt
um kombucha particular drink things like kefir bunch varieties
fermented foods different cultures different fermented foods Japanese natto
um another source ferment good gut microbiome work
Justin sonnenberg's lab close Labs Stanford School Medicine
shown people ingest four servings day low sugar fermented foods
greatly improves function gut microbiome particular enhances
function immune system reduces so-called inflammatorium reduces
inflammation brain body ways helpful effective brain
body mental health physical health performance ways
support gut microbiome strictly food come no surprise
people not ingesting four servings day fermented foods hopefully
getting enough fiber especially Prebiotic fiber one way support gut
microbiome although studies Justin sonnenberg's lab point fact fiber
intake not directly supportive gut microbiome everybody
individuals not others no effect individuals
actually made category say array inflammatory markers worse
actually led inflammation not say fiber bad fact
episode Dr Lane Norton discussed many benefits getting
enough fiber lot reasons people get enough fiber diet


least supporting gut microbiome four servings day low sugar fermented
foods seems best way support gut microbiome intake
nutrition people not achieving therefore foundational
supplements can just vitamin mineral supplements vitamin
mineral supplements plus digestive enzymes things plus adaptogens
now also tend include prebiotics probiotics designed support
proliferation maintenance

00:33:06 Supplements Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog

enough gut microbiota order support gut microbiome gut brain axis now
importance gut microbiome people not
getting enough support gut microbiome form low sugar fermented foods
Prebiotic fiber diet think perhaps one essential foundational
supplements irrespective whether not includes vitamins minerals adaptogens
digestive enzymes way support gut microbiome now gets
whole dimension categories Prebiotic probiotic capsules one needs
careful want say Prebiotic probiotic capsules
can buy first expensive best ones going refrigerated
required Refrigeration just good low sugar fermented foods way
instance pickles low sugar fermented food can support gut microbiome
buying pickles section grocery store pickles
not refrigerated well not going get gut microbiome supporting
effects pickles funny even conversation talking
pickles reality can greatly enhance microbiota getting
pickles require refrigeration include brine liquid
around true sauerkraut non-refrigerated sauerkraut not going
support gut microbiome will supply things perhaps not going
support gut microbiome refrigerated versions reason
people not getting enough food based support gut microbiome
importance gut microbiome one key categories
foundational supplements supplements create support microbiome
prebiotics probiotics tend refrigerated varieties
ones actually going work also tend expensive


evidence taking excessive amounts prebiotics probiotics typical
capsule forms prebiotics probiotics taken ongoing not short
periods time taken ongoing can lead issues like brain fog
nice literature growing one suggestion people
going take supplements support microbiome supplements
include low enough levels small enough amounts prebiotics probiotics
don't start venture realm brain fog issues
associated taking much Prebiotic probiotic form

00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs

discovered works best many people find works really well
people approach ask often
often say going take one supplement supplement
take rather just give one specific answer actually asked three
questions first question ask well sleeping night getting
enough sleep waking feeling rested not opens
whole different set interactions need discussions around
sorts things need possibly take order get sleep right
sleep foundation mental health physical health performance will
discussion little bit later episode second question asked
nutrition eating regularly found combination
macronutrients diet right think getting enough vitamins
minerals digestion conversation third thing
ask extremely important budget somebody


ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual
components can take combination order meet foundational
needs people not interested homework legwork
figure exactly dosages one reason indeed taken
athletic green since 2012. like makes feel better energy sleep
better digestion certainly better supports gut microbiome
reason want emphasize great sources
relevant things within foundational formulas athletic greens contains
certainly not route covering foundational Health needs
ways now somebody budget lower hundred dollars per month
spend foundational supplementation well couple discussions
now amount money devote foundational
supplementation zero course respect becomes discussion
sorts foods patterns food intake going best support mental
health physical health performance now somebody somewhere zero
dollars fifty dollars spend supplementation sake thing calling
foundational Health per month well different category supplement discussion
arises moment sort close conversation
foundational supplementation means many different things vitamins
minerals sometimes one vitamin mineral supplement means digestive


enzymes supplement combination vitamins minerals
means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based
mushroom-based formulations can buffer stress provide brain
body support often although not always believe include probiotics
prebiotics anything supports healthy gut microbiome think
broad spectrum supplement many many ingredients high quality covers
bases going best route ensuring foundational supplementation
covered think starting place supplementation
regimens say think covering foundational needs realm
vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes adaptogens going give
benefit cost benefit across board terms brain body
systems going allow feel better overall sleep better overall focus better
overall support different systems brain body going
allow best course also paying careful attention nutrition
simply cannot abandon

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go
newsletter can find toolkit can sign free toolkits like
point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important

start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

performance patients athletes everyday person essentially
saying 20 years ago discussion supplements mainly take
place within niche communities health food stores particular athletes

different supplements designed instance foundational
supplements supplements designed establish foundation
provide Insurance along nutritional intake ensure getting
things need order basic level mental health physical health
opportunity Optimal Performance now one category supplements
think appropriate fact advantageous multiple ingredients
given supplement throughout rest today's discussion going talk
advantage mainly focusing taking single ingredient formulations variety
reasons comes foundational supplements mainly talking
supplements contain vitamins minerals designed compensate
deficiencies might diet lack adequate diet
lack vitamin mineral intake arise well instance somebody
practices intermittent fasting components fasting somebody
not get enough vitamins minerals vegetables fruits Grains
meats well taking supplement can act insurance policy
vitamin mineral deficiencies many ways can advantageous although will talk
safety concerns just minutes now want acknowledge
soon talk vitamin mineral supplements Skeptics immediately raise


hands say well vitamin mineral supplements give
expensive urine Skeptics referring fact reality
ingest high levels water-soluble vitamins think vitamin C
vitamins indeed will excrete urine however also case
many people not getting enough water-soluble vitamins foods
also case many people also case ingesting higher
needed amounts water-soluble vitamins provided levels aren't exceedingly
High least say can safe provided levels
ingesting not exceedingly high typical vitamin mineral supplement
indeed going cover gaps deficiencies might arise water-soluble
vitamins food intake reality people getting enough
water-soluble vitamins food paying attention couple
things things simple lay regardless whether not
vegan vegetarian traditional omnivore eating animal-based
plant-based sources grains Etc even pure carnivore strict guess
called Lion diet just meat salt regardless type nutrition
follow will get vitamins minerals get fewer depending
nutritional program follow course depending often
much eat just sort obvious people take vitamin mineral
supplement will indeed excrete lot water-soluble vitamins will retain fat
soluble vitamins Skeptics will raise hands say not
want take high levels fat soluble vitamins will stored
system potentially levels dangerous provided vitamin mineral
supplements not taken excess unlikely going

00:21:07 Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule

buildup fat soluble vitamins system going problem
raises specific question need ask want take vitamin
mineral supplement well answer will highly individual really just
need address two things first cost within range can afford
want pay right oftentimes vitamin mineral supplements can quite inexpensive
can quite expensive can see full range ones
pennies per day way many dollars tens dollars per day


reported variations quality sourcing forth not aware
real differences quality water soluble fat soluble vitamins
found less expensive versus expensive vitamin mineral supplements
typically cost scales dosages different vitamins minerals
probably expected expensive obtain source vitamins
minerals tend lower quantities less expensive versions vitamin
mineral supplements just kind obvious need ask can
afford financially need ask able regularly ingest
enough foods enough variety cover vitamin mineral needs just food
people answer going immediate yes careful get
enough foods allow obtain vitamin mineral quota
individuals answer will no say people extremely
physically mentally active people perhaps following intermittent
fasting schedule not ingesting lot food general restricting food
intake specific times day well vitamin mineral supplement likely makes sense
however going important ingest vitamin mineral
supplement food ideally early day can set little bit
challenge intermittent fasters restricting feeding window late
day say well many water-soluble vitamins particular B
vitamins need ingested food otherwise can cause
stomach upset range people like can take B
vitamins empty stomach feel fine people feel really lousy take
B vitamins things talk later namely zinc
coenzyme Q10 really also taken food best time take
vitamin mineral supplement food believe going take
vitamin mineral supplement want take food don't want take
dosages vitamins minerals supplements exceedingly high
couple reasons one buildup fat soluble vitamins talked
reason people tend take high levels vitamins
minerals supplements tend spend less time focus making sure
optimizing nutrition least trying get nutrition right
mean getting nutrition right well think regardless whether not keto
omnivore carnivore vegan nutritional plan key thing get
75 80 Foods non-processed minimally processed


sources think agreement across board people avoid highly
processed foods highly processed foods going foods long ingredient
lists long shelf lives often includes snack foods include
snack foods like chips Etc pastries sit Shelf long time also
includes things like canned soups number different foods many
many ingredients preservatives people well avoid kinds foods
focus intake things non-processed things
like fruits vegetables notice non-processed foods will tend
short shelf life require refrigeration cases meat eggs Etc
minimally processed foods know rice oatmeals pastas beans
things sort beans oftentimes can completely unprocessed well course
two general categories unprocessed minimally process make

00:25:25 Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens

food intake goal health obtaining adequate amounts vitamins
minerals so-called foundational supplements include course vitamin mineral
supplements expanded last decade also include
supplements vitamins minerals also things like digestive enzymes
example indeed can get digestive enzymes
foods instance eating bit papaya even little bit Pineapple can assist
digestion certain aspects macronutrients naturally occurring
enzymes help digest things like carbohydrates fats proteins
food-based sources enzymes welcome look online just put
food based sources enzymes find nowadays lot
foundational supplements will include papain will include different lipases
anytime hear word Ace way means enzyme enzyme designed
break catalyze sort reaction biology nutrition particular
can find foundational supplements include vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes nowadays quality foundational supplements also
including things like adaptogens name adaptogens sort vague
indeed no specific operational definition something really important
understand supplementation companies indeed podcasts can talk


adaptogens without actually defining adaptogen operational way
say operational mean definition everyone given Arena
space research instance can agree talk adaptogenic
effects given compound talking things well foundational
supplements nowadays include vitamins minerals digestive enzymes so-called
adaptogens adaptogens broadly speaking thought improve body
brain's ability ability buffer various stressors things like
herbs like ashwagandha designed reduce cortisol levels sense
ashwagandha adaptogen ashwagandha effects related hormone
augmentation testosterone estrogen maybe even thyroid
Pathways talk little bit later talk supplements
hormone augmentation foundational supplements really expanded include lot
different categories nutrients micronutrients vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes designed achieve broad spectrum effects one category
supplementation think makes

00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition

sense explore multi-ingredient formulations thing often included
so-called foundational supplements probiotics prebiotics
designed augment support so-called gut microbiome gut microbiome
collection trillions little micro bacteria exist us mainly exist
mucous membrane-lined tissues body nasal passages
mouth vagina urethra gut whole way mouth
way end not just stomach trillions bacteria live trillions
microbacteria also live skin fact every time shake someone's hand
exchanging microbacteria micro bacteria often healthy us good us
support huge number positive biological functions microbacteria
live gut Elsewhere mucous line tissues can
disadvantageous us can harm health growing idea days based
number different Laboratories work including laboratory upstairs neighbor
Stanford Dr Justin Sonnenberg guest podcast great
diversity range microbiota called microbiome microbiota
microbacteria essentially referring thing microbiome whole


collection microbacteria lot different so-called species
microbacteria known advantageous immune system function hormone
function supports so-called gut brain axis important number things
including mood motivation actually supports production neurotransmitters
brain body can help keep motivated elevated mood support general
function neurons well not surprisingly ways support gut microbiome
ways harm gut microbiome refer podcast episode
Justin Sonnenberg can find hubermanlab.com want learn
different ways can support gut microbiome sake today's discussion
want emphasize methods supporting gut microbiome
direct consumption particular foods two categories foods
getting enough likely gut microbiome diverse
going support important functions just listed off functions well
two sources gut microbiota supporting foods low sugar fermented foods
things like sauerkraut kimchi Greek yogurt low sugar Greek yogurt
um kombucha particular drink things like kefir bunch varieties
fermented foods different cultures different fermented foods Japanese natto
um another source ferment good gut microbiome work
Justin sonnenberg's lab close Labs Stanford School Medicine
shown people ingest four servings day low sugar fermented foods
greatly improves function gut microbiome particular enhances
function immune system reduces so-called inflammatorium reduces
inflammation brain body ways helpful effective brain
body mental health physical health performance ways
support gut microbiome strictly food come no surprise
people not ingesting four servings day fermented foods hopefully
getting enough fiber especially Prebiotic fiber one way support gut
microbiome although studies Justin sonnenberg's lab point fact fiber
intake not directly supportive gut microbiome everybody
individuals not others no effect individuals
actually made category say array inflammatory markers worse
actually led inflammation not say fiber bad fact
episode Dr Lane Norton discussed many benefits getting
enough fiber lot reasons people get enough fiber diet


least supporting gut microbiome four servings day low sugar fermented
foods seems best way support gut microbiome intake
nutrition people not achieving therefore foundational
supplements can just vitamin mineral supplements vitamin
mineral supplements plus digestive enzymes things plus adaptogens
now also tend include prebiotics probiotics designed support
proliferation maintenance

00:33:06 Supplements Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog

whole dimension categories Prebiotic probiotic capsules one needs
careful want say Prebiotic probiotic capsules
can buy first expensive best ones going refrigerated
required Refrigeration just good low sugar fermented foods way
instance pickles low sugar fermented food can support gut microbiome
buying pickles section grocery store pickles
not refrigerated well not going get gut microbiome supporting
effects pickles funny even conversation talking
pickles reality can greatly enhance microbiota getting
pickles require refrigeration include brine liquid
around true sauerkraut non-refrigerated sauerkraut not going
support gut microbiome will supply things perhaps not going
support gut microbiome refrigerated versions reason
people not getting enough food based support gut microbiome
importance gut microbiome one key categories
foundational supplements supplements create support microbiome
prebiotics probiotics tend refrigerated varieties
ones actually going work also tend expensive


evidence taking excessive amounts prebiotics probiotics typical
capsule forms prebiotics probiotics taken ongoing not short

00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs

discovered works best many people find works really well
people approach ask often
often say going take one supplement supplement
take rather just give one specific answer actually asked three
questions first question ask well sleeping night getting
enough sleep waking feeling rested not opens
whole different set interactions need discussions around
sorts things need possibly take order get sleep right
sleep foundation mental health physical health performance will
discussion little bit later episode second question asked
nutrition eating regularly found combination
macronutrients diet right think getting enough vitamins
minerals digestion conversation third thing
ask extremely important budget somebody


ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual
components can take combination order meet foundational
needs people not interested homework legwork
figure exactly dosages one reason indeed taken
athletic green since 2012. like makes feel better energy sleep
better digestion certainly better supports gut microbiome
reason want emphasize great sources
relevant things within foundational formulas athletic greens contains
certainly not route covering foundational Health needs
ways now somebody budget lower hundred dollars per month
spend foundational supplementation well couple discussions
now amount money devote foundational
supplementation zero course respect becomes discussion
sorts foods patterns food intake going best support mental
health physical health performance now somebody somewhere zero
dollars fifty dollars spend supplementation sake thing calling
foundational Health per month well different category supplement discussion
arises moment sort close conversation
foundational supplementation means many different things vitamins
minerals sometimes one vitamin mineral supplement means digestive


enzymes supplement combination vitamins minerals
means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based
mushroom-based formulations can buffer stress provide brain
body support often although not always believe include probiotics
prebiotics anything supports healthy gut microbiome think
broad spectrum supplement many many ingredients high quality covers
bases going best route ensuring foundational supplementation
covered think starting place supplementation
regimens say think covering foundational needs realm
vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes adaptogens going give
benefit cost benefit across board terms brain body
systems going allow feel better overall sleep better overall focus better
overall support different systems brain body going
allow best course also paying careful attention nutrition
simply cannot abandon

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go
newsletter can find toolkit can sign free toolkits like
point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin

hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting

acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important

start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode

hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning

fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

provide Insurance along nutritional intake ensure getting
things need order basic level mental health physical health
opportunity Optimal Performance now one category supplements
think appropriate fact advantageous multiple ingredients
given supplement throughout rest today's discussion going talk
advantage mainly focusing taking single ingredient formulations variety
reasons comes foundational supplements mainly talking
supplements contain vitamins minerals designed compensate
deficiencies might diet lack adequate diet
lack vitamin mineral intake arise well instance somebody
practices intermittent fasting components fasting somebody
not get enough vitamins minerals vegetables fruits Grains
meats well taking supplement can act insurance policy
vitamin mineral deficiencies many ways can advantageous although will talk
safety concerns just minutes now want acknowledge
soon talk vitamin mineral supplements Skeptics immediately raise


hands say well vitamin mineral supplements give
expensive urine Skeptics referring fact reality
ingest high levels water-soluble vitamins think vitamin C
vitamins indeed will excrete urine however also case
many people not getting enough water-soluble vitamins foods
also case many people also case ingesting higher
needed amounts water-soluble vitamins provided levels aren't exceedingly
High least say can safe provided levels
ingesting not exceedingly high typical vitamin mineral supplement
indeed going cover gaps deficiencies might arise water-soluble
vitamins food intake reality people getting enough
water-soluble vitamins food paying attention couple
things things simple lay regardless whether not
vegan vegetarian traditional omnivore eating animal-based
plant-based sources grains Etc even pure carnivore strict guess
called Lion diet just meat salt regardless type nutrition
follow will get vitamins minerals get fewer depending
nutritional program follow course depending often
much eat just sort obvious people take vitamin mineral
supplement will indeed excrete lot water-soluble vitamins will retain fat
soluble vitamins Skeptics will raise hands say not
want take high levels fat soluble vitamins will stored
system potentially levels dangerous provided vitamin mineral
supplements not taken excess unlikely going

00:21:07 Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule

buildup fat soluble vitamins system going problem
raises specific question need ask want take vitamin
mineral supplement well answer will highly individual really just
need address two things first cost within range can afford
want pay right oftentimes vitamin mineral supplements can quite inexpensive
can quite expensive can see full range ones
pennies per day way many dollars tens dollars per day


reported variations quality sourcing forth not aware
real differences quality water soluble fat soluble vitamins
found less expensive versus expensive vitamin mineral supplements
typically cost scales dosages different vitamins minerals
probably expected expensive obtain source vitamins
minerals tend lower quantities less expensive versions vitamin
mineral supplements just kind obvious need ask can
afford financially need ask able regularly ingest
enough foods enough variety cover vitamin mineral needs just food
people answer going immediate yes careful get
enough foods allow obtain vitamin mineral quota
individuals answer will no say people extremely
physically mentally active people perhaps following intermittent
fasting schedule not ingesting lot food general restricting food
intake specific times day well vitamin mineral supplement likely makes sense
however going important ingest vitamin mineral
supplement food ideally early day can set little bit
challenge intermittent fasters restricting feeding window late
day say well many water-soluble vitamins particular B
vitamins need ingested food otherwise can cause
stomach upset range people like can take B
vitamins empty stomach feel fine people feel really lousy take
B vitamins things talk later namely zinc
coenzyme Q10 really also taken food best time take
vitamin mineral supplement food believe going take
vitamin mineral supplement want take food don't want take
dosages vitamins minerals supplements exceedingly high
couple reasons one buildup fat soluble vitamins talked
reason people tend take high levels vitamins
minerals supplements tend spend less time focus making sure
optimizing nutrition least trying get nutrition right
mean getting nutrition right well think regardless whether not keto
omnivore carnivore vegan nutritional plan key thing get
75 80 Foods non-processed minimally processed


sources think agreement across board people avoid highly
processed foods highly processed foods going foods long ingredient
lists long shelf lives often includes snack foods include
snack foods like chips Etc pastries sit Shelf long time also
includes things like canned soups number different foods many
many ingredients preservatives people well avoid kinds foods
focus intake things non-processed things
like fruits vegetables notice non-processed foods will tend
short shelf life require refrigeration cases meat eggs Etc
minimally processed foods know rice oatmeals pastas beans

00:25:25 Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens

food intake goal health obtaining adequate amounts vitamins
minerals so-called foundational supplements include course vitamin mineral
supplements expanded last decade also include
supplements vitamins minerals also things like digestive enzymes
example indeed can get digestive enzymes
foods instance eating bit papaya even little bit Pineapple can assist
digestion certain aspects macronutrients naturally occurring
enzymes help digest things like carbohydrates fats proteins
food-based sources enzymes welcome look online just put
food based sources enzymes find nowadays lot
foundational supplements will include papain will include different lipases
anytime hear word Ace way means enzyme enzyme designed
break catalyze sort reaction biology nutrition particular
can find foundational supplements include vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes nowadays quality foundational supplements also
including things like adaptogens name adaptogens sort vague
indeed no specific operational definition something really important
understand supplementation companies indeed podcasts can talk


adaptogens without actually defining adaptogen operational way
say operational mean definition everyone given Arena
space research instance can agree talk adaptogenic
effects given compound talking things well foundational
supplements nowadays include vitamins minerals digestive enzymes so-called
adaptogens adaptogens broadly speaking thought improve body
brain's ability ability buffer various stressors things like
herbs like ashwagandha designed reduce cortisol levels sense
ashwagandha adaptogen ashwagandha effects related hormone
augmentation testosterone estrogen maybe even thyroid
Pathways talk little bit later talk supplements
hormone augmentation foundational supplements really expanded include lot
different categories nutrients micronutrients vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes designed achieve broad spectrum effects one category
supplementation think makes

00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition

sense explore multi-ingredient formulations thing often included
so-called foundational supplements probiotics prebiotics
designed augment support so-called gut microbiome gut microbiome
collection trillions little micro bacteria exist us mainly exist
mucous membrane-lined tissues body nasal passages
mouth vagina urethra gut whole way mouth
way end not just stomach trillions bacteria live trillions
microbacteria also live skin fact every time shake someone's hand
exchanging microbacteria micro bacteria often healthy us good us
support huge number positive biological functions microbacteria
live gut Elsewhere mucous line tissues can
disadvantageous us can harm health growing idea days based
number different Laboratories work including laboratory upstairs neighbor
Stanford Dr Justin Sonnenberg guest podcast great
diversity range microbiota called microbiome microbiota
microbacteria essentially referring thing microbiome whole


collection microbacteria lot different so-called species
microbacteria known advantageous immune system function hormone
function supports so-called gut brain axis important number things
including mood motivation actually supports production neurotransmitters
brain body can help keep motivated elevated mood support general
function neurons well not surprisingly ways support gut microbiome
ways harm gut microbiome refer podcast episode
Justin Sonnenberg can find hubermanlab.com want learn
different ways can support gut microbiome sake today's discussion
want emphasize methods supporting gut microbiome
direct consumption particular foods two categories foods
getting enough likely gut microbiome diverse
going support important functions just listed off functions well
two sources gut microbiota supporting foods low sugar fermented foods
things like sauerkraut kimchi Greek yogurt low sugar Greek yogurt
um kombucha particular drink things like kefir bunch varieties
fermented foods different cultures different fermented foods Japanese natto
um another source ferment good gut microbiome work
Justin sonnenberg's lab close Labs Stanford School Medicine
shown people ingest four servings day low sugar fermented foods
greatly improves function gut microbiome particular enhances
function immune system reduces so-called inflammatorium reduces
inflammation brain body ways helpful effective brain
body mental health physical health performance ways
support gut microbiome strictly food come no surprise
people not ingesting four servings day fermented foods hopefully
getting enough fiber especially Prebiotic fiber one way support gut
microbiome although studies Justin sonnenberg's lab point fact fiber
intake not directly supportive gut microbiome everybody
individuals not others no effect individuals
actually made category say array inflammatory markers worse
actually led inflammation not say fiber bad fact
episode Dr Lane Norton discussed many benefits getting
enough fiber lot reasons people get enough fiber diet


least supporting gut microbiome four servings day low sugar fermented
foods seems best way support gut microbiome intake
nutrition people not achieving therefore foundational
supplements can just vitamin mineral supplements vitamin
mineral supplements plus digestive enzymes things plus adaptogens
now also tend include prebiotics probiotics designed support
proliferation maintenance

00:33:06 Supplements Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog

enough gut microbiota order support gut microbiome gut brain axis now
importance gut microbiome people not
getting enough support gut microbiome form low sugar fermented foods
Prebiotic fiber diet think perhaps one essential foundational
supplements irrespective whether not includes vitamins minerals adaptogens
digestive enzymes way support gut microbiome now gets
whole dimension categories Prebiotic probiotic capsules one needs
careful want say Prebiotic probiotic capsules
can buy first expensive best ones going refrigerated
required Refrigeration just good low sugar fermented foods way
instance pickles low sugar fermented food can support gut microbiome
buying pickles section grocery store pickles
not refrigerated well not going get gut microbiome supporting
effects pickles funny even conversation talking
pickles reality can greatly enhance microbiota getting
pickles require refrigeration include brine liquid
around true sauerkraut non-refrigerated sauerkraut not going
support gut microbiome will supply things perhaps not going
support gut microbiome refrigerated versions reason
people not getting enough food based support gut microbiome
importance gut microbiome one key categories
foundational supplements supplements create support microbiome
prebiotics probiotics tend refrigerated varieties
ones actually going work also tend expensive


evidence taking excessive amounts prebiotics probiotics typical
capsule forms prebiotics probiotics taken ongoing not short
periods time taken ongoing can lead issues like brain fog
nice literature growing one suggestion people
going take supplements support microbiome supplements
include low enough levels small enough amounts prebiotics probiotics
don't start venture realm brain fog issues
associated taking much Prebiotic probiotic form

adaptogens important one get back little bit later reason mention
now indeed hard get so-called adaptogens sufficient concentrations
food-based sources assume people aren't collecting
chaga mushroom ashwagandha herbs combining salads

00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs

discovered works best many people find works really well
people approach ask often
often say going take one supplement supplement
take rather just give one specific answer actually asked three
questions first question ask well sleeping night getting
enough sleep waking feeling rested not opens
whole different set interactions need discussions around
sorts things need possibly take order get sleep right
sleep foundation mental health physical health performance will
discussion little bit later episode second question asked
nutrition eating regularly found combination
macronutrients diet right think getting enough vitamins
minerals digestion conversation third thing
ask extremely important budget somebody


ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual
components can take combination order meet foundational
needs people not interested homework legwork
figure exactly dosages one reason indeed taken
athletic green since 2012. like makes feel better energy sleep
better digestion certainly better supports gut microbiome
reason want emphasize great sources
relevant things within foundational formulas athletic greens contains
certainly not route covering foundational Health needs
ways now somebody budget lower hundred dollars per month
spend foundational supplementation well couple discussions
now amount money devote foundational
supplementation zero course respect becomes discussion
sorts foods patterns food intake going best support mental
health physical health performance now somebody somewhere zero
dollars fifty dollars spend supplementation sake thing calling
foundational Health per month well different category supplement discussion
arises moment sort close conversation
foundational supplementation means many different things vitamins
minerals sometimes one vitamin mineral supplement means digestive


enzymes supplement combination vitamins minerals
means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based
mushroom-based formulations can buffer stress provide brain
body support often although not always believe include probiotics
prebiotics anything supports healthy gut microbiome think
broad spectrum supplement many many ingredients high quality covers
bases going best route ensuring foundational supplementation
covered think starting place supplementation
regimens say think covering foundational needs realm
vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes adaptogens going give
benefit cost benefit across board terms brain body
systems going allow feel better overall sleep better overall focus better
overall support different systems brain body going
allow best course also paying careful attention nutrition
simply cannot abandon

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect

aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

will suffer one reasons women will stop periods
not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin
protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood

acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched

harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin

course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take

made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

performance patients athletes everyday person essentially
saying 20 years ago discussion supplements mainly take
place within niche communities health food stores particular athletes
nowadays think almost everyone familiar fact yes indeed
standard vitamin supplements also supplements Vitamin D3
designed make sure people certain amounts hormones

clear throughout episode no pill replacement
Sunshine pill replacement food replacement matter exercise

different supplements designed instance foundational
supplements supplements designed establish foundation
provide Insurance along nutritional intake ensure getting
things need order basic level mental health physical health
opportunity Optimal Performance now one category supplements
think appropriate fact advantageous multiple ingredients
given supplement throughout rest today's discussion going talk
advantage mainly focusing taking single ingredient formulations variety
reasons comes foundational supplements mainly talking
supplements contain vitamins minerals designed compensate
deficiencies might diet lack adequate diet
lack vitamin mineral intake arise well instance somebody
practices intermittent fasting components fasting somebody
not get enough vitamins minerals vegetables fruits Grains
meats well taking supplement can act insurance policy
vitamin mineral deficiencies many ways can advantageous although will talk
safety concerns just minutes now want acknowledge
soon talk vitamin mineral supplements Skeptics immediately raise


hands say well vitamin mineral supplements give
expensive urine Skeptics referring fact reality
ingest high levels water-soluble vitamins think vitamin C
vitamins indeed will excrete urine however also case
many people not getting enough water-soluble vitamins foods
also case many people also case ingesting higher
needed amounts water-soluble vitamins provided levels aren't exceedingly
High least say can safe provided levels
ingesting not exceedingly high typical vitamin mineral supplement
indeed going cover gaps deficiencies might arise water-soluble
vitamins food intake reality people getting enough
water-soluble vitamins food paying attention couple
things things simple lay regardless whether not
vegan vegetarian traditional omnivore eating animal-based
plant-based sources grains Etc even pure carnivore strict guess
called Lion diet just meat salt regardless type nutrition
follow will get vitamins minerals get fewer depending
nutritional program follow course depending often
much eat just sort obvious people take vitamin mineral
supplement will indeed excrete lot water-soluble vitamins will retain fat

system potentially levels dangerous provided vitamin mineral
supplements not taken excess unlikely going

00:21:07 Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule

buildup fat soluble vitamins system going problem
raises specific question need ask want take vitamin
mineral supplement well answer will highly individual really just
need address two things first cost within range can afford
want pay right oftentimes vitamin mineral supplements can quite inexpensive
can quite expensive can see full range ones
pennies per day way many dollars tens dollars per day


reported variations quality sourcing forth not aware
real differences quality water soluble fat soluble vitamins
found less expensive versus expensive vitamin mineral supplements
typically cost scales dosages different vitamins minerals
probably expected expensive obtain source vitamins
minerals tend lower quantities less expensive versions vitamin
mineral supplements just kind obvious need ask can
afford financially need ask able regularly ingest
enough foods enough variety cover vitamin mineral needs just food
people answer going immediate yes careful get
enough foods allow obtain vitamin mineral quota
individuals answer will no say people extremely
physically mentally active people perhaps following intermittent
fasting schedule not ingesting lot food general restricting food
intake specific times day well vitamin mineral supplement likely makes sense
however going important ingest vitamin mineral
supplement food ideally early day can set little bit
challenge intermittent fasters restricting feeding window late
day say well many water-soluble vitamins particular B
vitamins need ingested food otherwise can cause
stomach upset range people like can take B
vitamins empty stomach feel fine people feel really lousy take
B vitamins things talk later namely zinc
coenzyme Q10 really also taken food best time take
vitamin mineral supplement food believe going take
vitamin mineral supplement want take food don't want take
dosages vitamins minerals supplements exceedingly high
couple reasons one buildup fat soluble vitamins talked
reason people tend take high levels vitamins
minerals supplements tend spend less time focus making sure
optimizing nutrition least trying get nutrition right
mean getting nutrition right well think regardless whether not keto
omnivore carnivore vegan nutritional plan key thing get
75 80 Foods non-processed minimally processed


sources think agreement across board people avoid highly
processed foods highly processed foods going foods long ingredient
lists long shelf lives often includes snack foods include
snack foods like chips Etc pastries sit Shelf long time also
includes things like canned soups number different foods many
many ingredients preservatives people well avoid kinds foods
focus intake things non-processed things
like fruits vegetables notice non-processed foods will tend
short shelf life require refrigeration cases meat eggs Etc
minimally processed foods know rice oatmeals pastas beans

00:25:25 Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens

food intake goal health obtaining adequate amounts vitamins
minerals so-called foundational supplements include course vitamin mineral
supplements expanded last decade also include
supplements vitamins minerals also things like digestive enzymes
example indeed can get digestive enzymes
foods instance eating bit papaya even little bit Pineapple can assist
digestion certain aspects macronutrients naturally occurring
enzymes help digest things like carbohydrates fats proteins
food-based sources enzymes welcome look online just put
food based sources enzymes find nowadays lot
foundational supplements will include papain will include different lipases
anytime hear word Ace way means enzyme enzyme designed
break catalyze sort reaction biology nutrition particular
can find foundational supplements include vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes nowadays quality foundational supplements also
including things like adaptogens name adaptogens sort vague
indeed no specific operational definition something really important
understand supplementation companies indeed podcasts can talk


adaptogens without actually defining adaptogen operational way
say operational mean definition everyone given Arena
space research instance can agree talk adaptogenic
effects given compound talking things well foundational
supplements nowadays include vitamins minerals digestive enzymes so-called
adaptogens adaptogens broadly speaking thought improve body
brain's ability ability buffer various stressors things like
herbs like ashwagandha designed reduce cortisol levels sense
ashwagandha adaptogen ashwagandha effects related hormone
augmentation testosterone estrogen maybe even thyroid
Pathways talk little bit later talk supplements
hormone augmentation foundational supplements really expanded include lot
different categories nutrients micronutrients vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes designed achieve broad spectrum effects one category
supplementation think makes

00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition

sense explore multi-ingredient formulations thing often included
so-called foundational supplements probiotics prebiotics
designed augment support so-called gut microbiome gut microbiome
collection trillions little micro bacteria exist us mainly exist
mucous membrane-lined tissues body nasal passages
mouth vagina urethra gut whole way mouth
way end not just stomach trillions bacteria live trillions
microbacteria also live skin fact every time shake someone's hand
exchanging microbacteria micro bacteria often healthy us good us
support huge number positive biological functions microbacteria
live gut Elsewhere mucous line tissues can
disadvantageous us can harm health growing idea days based
number different Laboratories work including laboratory upstairs neighbor
Stanford Dr Justin Sonnenberg guest podcast great
diversity range microbiota called microbiome microbiota
microbacteria essentially referring thing microbiome whole


collection microbacteria lot different so-called species
microbacteria known advantageous immune system function hormone
function supports so-called gut brain axis important number things
including mood motivation actually supports production neurotransmitters
brain body can help keep motivated elevated mood support general
function neurons well not surprisingly ways support gut microbiome
ways harm gut microbiome refer podcast episode
Justin Sonnenberg can find hubermanlab.com want learn
different ways can support gut microbiome sake today's discussion
want emphasize methods supporting gut microbiome
direct consumption particular foods two categories foods
getting enough likely gut microbiome diverse
going support important functions just listed off functions well
two sources gut microbiota supporting foods low sugar fermented foods
things like sauerkraut kimchi Greek yogurt low sugar Greek yogurt
um kombucha particular drink things like kefir bunch varieties
fermented foods different cultures different fermented foods Japanese natto
um another source ferment good gut microbiome work
Justin sonnenberg's lab close Labs Stanford School Medicine
shown people ingest four servings day low sugar fermented foods
greatly improves function gut microbiome particular enhances
function immune system reduces so-called inflammatorium reduces
inflammation brain body ways helpful effective brain
body mental health physical health performance ways
support gut microbiome strictly food come no surprise
people not ingesting four servings day fermented foods hopefully
getting enough fiber especially Prebiotic fiber one way support gut
microbiome although studies Justin sonnenberg's lab point fact fiber
intake not directly supportive gut microbiome everybody
individuals not others no effect individuals
actually made category say array inflammatory markers worse
actually led inflammation not say fiber bad fact
episode Dr Lane Norton discussed many benefits getting
enough fiber lot reasons people get enough fiber diet


least supporting gut microbiome four servings day low sugar fermented
foods seems best way support gut microbiome intake
nutrition people not achieving therefore foundational
supplements can just vitamin mineral supplements vitamin
mineral supplements plus digestive enzymes things plus adaptogens
now also tend include prebiotics probiotics designed support
proliferation maintenance

00:33:06 Supplements Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog

enough gut microbiota order support gut microbiome gut brain axis now
importance gut microbiome people not
getting enough support gut microbiome form low sugar fermented foods
Prebiotic fiber diet think perhaps one essential foundational
supplements irrespective whether not includes vitamins minerals adaptogens
digestive enzymes way support gut microbiome now gets
whole dimension categories Prebiotic probiotic capsules one needs
careful want say Prebiotic probiotic capsules
can buy first expensive best ones going refrigerated
required Refrigeration just good low sugar fermented foods way
instance pickles low sugar fermented food can support gut microbiome
buying pickles section grocery store pickles
not refrigerated well not going get gut microbiome supporting
effects pickles funny even conversation talking
pickles reality can greatly enhance microbiota getting
pickles require refrigeration include brine liquid
around true sauerkraut non-refrigerated sauerkraut not going
support gut microbiome will supply things perhaps not going
support gut microbiome refrigerated versions reason
people not getting enough food based support gut microbiome
importance gut microbiome one key categories
foundational supplements supplements create support microbiome
prebiotics probiotics tend refrigerated varieties
ones actually going work also tend expensive


evidence taking excessive amounts prebiotics probiotics typical
capsule forms prebiotics probiotics taken ongoing not short
periods time taken ongoing can lead issues like brain fog
nice literature growing one suggestion people
going take supplements support microbiome supplements
include low enough levels small enough amounts prebiotics probiotics
don't start venture realm brain fog issues
associated taking much Prebiotic probiotic form

adaptogens important one get back little bit later reason mention
now indeed hard get so-called adaptogens sufficient concentrations
food-based sources assume people aren't collecting
chaga mushroom ashwagandha herbs combining salads

00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs

discovered works best many people find works really well
people approach ask often
often say going take one supplement supplement
take rather just give one specific answer actually asked three
questions first question ask well sleeping night getting
enough sleep waking feeling rested not opens
whole different set interactions need discussions around
sorts things need possibly take order get sleep right
sleep foundation mental health physical health performance will
discussion little bit later episode second question asked
nutrition eating regularly found combination
macronutrients diet right think getting enough vitamins
minerals digestion conversation third thing
ask extremely important budget somebody


ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual
components can take combination order meet foundational
needs people not interested homework legwork
figure exactly dosages one reason indeed taken
athletic green since 2012. like makes feel better energy sleep
better digestion certainly better supports gut microbiome
reason want emphasize great sources
relevant things within foundational formulas athletic greens contains
certainly not route covering foundational Health needs
ways now somebody budget lower hundred dollars per month
spend foundational supplementation well couple discussions
now amount money devote foundational
supplementation zero course respect becomes discussion
sorts foods patterns food intake going best support mental
health physical health performance now somebody somewhere zero
dollars fifty dollars spend supplementation sake thing calling
foundational Health per month well different category supplement discussion
arises moment sort close conversation
foundational supplementation means many different things vitamins
minerals sometimes one vitamin mineral supplement means digestive


enzymes supplement combination vitamins minerals
means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based
mushroom-based formulations can buffer stress provide brain
body support often although not always believe include probiotics
prebiotics anything supports healthy gut microbiome think
broad spectrum supplement many many ingredients high quality covers
bases going best route ensuring foundational supplementation
covered think starting place supplementation
regimens say think covering foundational needs realm
vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes adaptogens going give
benefit cost benefit across board terms brain body
systems going allow feel better overall sleep better overall focus better
overall support different systems brain body going
allow best course also paying careful attention nutrition
simply cannot abandon

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go

point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

glucose well sex hormone binding globulin going increase dramatically
conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way
hormones insulin impact hormones free testosterone
acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases
cortisol levels cortisol levels important elevated early day
focus alertness immune function make sure cortisol levels
low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise
also relatively short meaning hour less bouts intense resistance training
times per week can also dramatically alter hormone profiles fact episode
Dr Duncan French find episode hubermanlab.com
described strenuous still brief two day week protocol using resistance
training specifically increase testosterone free testosterone growth hormone
nutrition matters exercise matters comes increasing supporting
augmenting different hormones just discussion testosterone free
testosterone estrogen also vast discussion thyroid hormone Etc
covered topics previous episodes behavioral
tools place right things avoiding wrong things
right things support hormones avoiding things diminish
hormones ways can detrimental nutrition place support
hormones makes sense turn consider supplements can support
hormones believe want get behaviors nutrition correct
start thinking supplementation hormones repeat get
nutrition behaviors correct sake hormones health
purposes start thinking supplementation hormones certainly


start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

hands say well vitamin mineral supplements give
expensive urine Skeptics referring fact reality
ingest high levels water-soluble vitamins think vitamin C
vitamins indeed will excrete urine however also case
many people not getting enough water-soluble vitamins foods
also case many people also case ingesting higher
needed amounts water-soluble vitamins provided levels aren't exceedingly
High least say can safe provided levels
ingesting not exceedingly high typical vitamin mineral supplement
indeed going cover gaps deficiencies might arise water-soluble
vitamins food intake reality people getting enough
water-soluble vitamins food paying attention couple
things things simple lay regardless whether not
vegan vegetarian traditional omnivore eating animal-based
plant-based sources grains Etc even pure carnivore strict guess
called Lion diet just meat salt regardless type nutrition
follow will get vitamins minerals get fewer depending
nutritional program follow course depending often
much eat just sort obvious people take vitamin mineral

supplements not taken excess unlikely going

00:21:07 Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule

buildup fat soluble vitamins system going problem
raises specific question need ask want take vitamin
mineral supplement well answer will highly individual really just
need address two things first cost within range can afford
want pay right oftentimes vitamin mineral supplements can quite inexpensive
can quite expensive can see full range ones
pennies per day way many dollars tens dollars per day


reported variations quality sourcing forth not aware
real differences quality water soluble fat soluble vitamins
found less expensive versus expensive vitamin mineral supplements
typically cost scales dosages different vitamins minerals
probably expected expensive obtain source vitamins
minerals tend lower quantities less expensive versions vitamin
mineral supplements just kind obvious need ask can
afford financially need ask able regularly ingest
enough foods enough variety cover vitamin mineral needs just food
people answer going immediate yes careful get
enough foods allow obtain vitamin mineral quota
individuals answer will no say people extremely
physically mentally active people perhaps following intermittent
fasting schedule not ingesting lot food general restricting food
intake specific times day well vitamin mineral supplement likely makes sense
however going important ingest vitamin mineral
supplement food ideally early day can set little bit
challenge intermittent fasters restricting feeding window late
day say well many water-soluble vitamins particular B
vitamins need ingested food otherwise can cause
stomach upset range people like can take B
vitamins empty stomach feel fine people feel really lousy take
B vitamins things talk later namely zinc
coenzyme Q10 really also taken food best time take
vitamin mineral supplement food believe going take
vitamin mineral supplement want take food don't want take
dosages vitamins minerals supplements exceedingly high
couple reasons one buildup fat soluble vitamins talked
reason people tend take high levels vitamins
minerals supplements tend spend less time focus making sure
optimizing nutrition least trying get nutrition right
mean getting nutrition right well think regardless whether not keto
omnivore carnivore vegan nutritional plan key thing get
75 80 Foods non-processed minimally processed


sources think agreement across board people avoid highly
processed foods highly processed foods going foods long ingredient
lists long shelf lives often includes snack foods include
snack foods like chips Etc pastries sit Shelf long time also
includes things like canned soups number different foods many
many ingredients preservatives people well avoid kinds foods
focus intake things non-processed things
like fruits vegetables notice non-processed foods will tend
short shelf life require refrigeration cases meat eggs Etc

00:25:25 Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens

food intake goal health obtaining adequate amounts vitamins
minerals so-called foundational supplements include course vitamin mineral
supplements expanded last decade also include
supplements vitamins minerals also things like digestive enzymes
example indeed can get digestive enzymes
foods instance eating bit papaya even little bit Pineapple can assist
digestion certain aspects macronutrients naturally occurring
enzymes help digest things like carbohydrates fats proteins
food-based sources enzymes welcome look online just put
food based sources enzymes find nowadays lot
foundational supplements will include papain will include different lipases
anytime hear word Ace way means enzyme enzyme designed
break catalyze sort reaction biology nutrition particular
can find foundational supplements include vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes nowadays quality foundational supplements also
including things like adaptogens name adaptogens sort vague
indeed no specific operational definition something really important
understand supplementation companies indeed podcasts can talk


adaptogens without actually defining adaptogen operational way
say operational mean definition everyone given Arena
space research instance can agree talk adaptogenic
effects given compound talking things well foundational
supplements nowadays include vitamins minerals digestive enzymes so-called
adaptogens adaptogens broadly speaking thought improve body
brain's ability ability buffer various stressors things like
herbs like ashwagandha designed reduce cortisol levels sense
ashwagandha adaptogen ashwagandha effects related hormone
augmentation testosterone estrogen maybe even thyroid
Pathways talk little bit later talk supplements
hormone augmentation foundational supplements really expanded include lot
different categories nutrients micronutrients vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes designed achieve broad spectrum effects one category
supplementation think makes

00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition

sense explore multi-ingredient formulations thing often included
so-called foundational supplements probiotics prebiotics
designed augment support so-called gut microbiome gut microbiome
collection trillions little micro bacteria exist us mainly exist
mucous membrane-lined tissues body nasal passages
mouth vagina urethra gut whole way mouth
way end not just stomach trillions bacteria live trillions
microbacteria also live skin fact every time shake someone's hand
exchanging microbacteria micro bacteria often healthy us good us
support huge number positive biological functions microbacteria
live gut Elsewhere mucous line tissues can
disadvantageous us can harm health growing idea days based
number different Laboratories work including laboratory upstairs neighbor
Stanford Dr Justin Sonnenberg guest podcast great
diversity range microbiota called microbiome microbiota
microbacteria essentially referring thing microbiome whole


collection microbacteria lot different so-called species
microbacteria known advantageous immune system function hormone
function supports so-called gut brain axis important number things
including mood motivation actually supports production neurotransmitters
brain body can help keep motivated elevated mood support general
function neurons well not surprisingly ways support gut microbiome
ways harm gut microbiome refer podcast episode
Justin Sonnenberg can find hubermanlab.com want learn
different ways can support gut microbiome sake today's discussion
want emphasize methods supporting gut microbiome
direct consumption particular foods two categories foods
getting enough likely gut microbiome diverse
going support important functions just listed off functions well
two sources gut microbiota supporting foods low sugar fermented foods
things like sauerkraut kimchi Greek yogurt low sugar Greek yogurt
um kombucha particular drink things like kefir bunch varieties
fermented foods different cultures different fermented foods Japanese natto
um another source ferment good gut microbiome work
Justin sonnenberg's lab close Labs Stanford School Medicine
shown people ingest four servings day low sugar fermented foods
greatly improves function gut microbiome particular enhances
function immune system reduces so-called inflammatorium reduces
inflammation brain body ways helpful effective brain
body mental health physical health performance ways
support gut microbiome strictly food come no surprise
people not ingesting four servings day fermented foods hopefully
getting enough fiber especially Prebiotic fiber one way support gut
microbiome although studies Justin sonnenberg's lab point fact fiber
intake not directly supportive gut microbiome everybody
individuals not others no effect individuals
actually made category say array inflammatory markers worse
actually led inflammation not say fiber bad fact
episode Dr Lane Norton discussed many benefits getting
enough fiber lot reasons people get enough fiber diet


least supporting gut microbiome four servings day low sugar fermented
foods seems best way support gut microbiome intake
nutrition people not achieving therefore foundational
supplements can just vitamin mineral supplements vitamin
mineral supplements plus digestive enzymes things plus adaptogens
now also tend include prebiotics probiotics designed support
proliferation maintenance

00:33:06 Supplements Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog

enough gut microbiota order support gut microbiome gut brain axis now
importance gut microbiome people not
getting enough support gut microbiome form low sugar fermented foods
Prebiotic fiber diet think perhaps one essential foundational
supplements irrespective whether not includes vitamins minerals adaptogens
digestive enzymes way support gut microbiome now gets
whole dimension categories Prebiotic probiotic capsules one needs
careful want say Prebiotic probiotic capsules
can buy first expensive best ones going refrigerated
required Refrigeration just good low sugar fermented foods way
instance pickles low sugar fermented food can support gut microbiome
buying pickles section grocery store pickles
not refrigerated well not going get gut microbiome supporting
effects pickles funny even conversation talking
pickles reality can greatly enhance microbiota getting
pickles require refrigeration include brine liquid
around true sauerkraut non-refrigerated sauerkraut not going
support gut microbiome will supply things perhaps not going
support gut microbiome refrigerated versions reason
people not getting enough food based support gut microbiome
importance gut microbiome one key categories
foundational supplements supplements create support microbiome
prebiotics probiotics tend refrigerated varieties
ones actually going work also tend expensive


evidence taking excessive amounts prebiotics probiotics typical
capsule forms prebiotics probiotics taken ongoing not short
periods time taken ongoing can lead issues like brain fog
nice literature growing one suggestion people
going take supplements support microbiome supplements
include low enough levels small enough amounts prebiotics probiotics
don't start venture realm brain fog issues
associated taking much Prebiotic probiotic form

00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs

discovered works best many people find works really well
people approach ask often
often say going take one supplement supplement
take rather just give one specific answer actually asked three
questions first question ask well sleeping night getting
enough sleep waking feeling rested not opens
whole different set interactions need discussions around
sorts things need possibly take order get sleep right
sleep foundation mental health physical health performance will
discussion little bit later episode second question asked
nutrition eating regularly found combination
macronutrients diet right think getting enough vitamins
minerals digestion conversation third thing
ask extremely important budget somebody


ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual
components can take combination order meet foundational
needs people not interested homework legwork
figure exactly dosages one reason indeed taken
athletic green since 2012. like makes feel better energy sleep
better digestion certainly better supports gut microbiome
reason want emphasize great sources
relevant things within foundational formulas athletic greens contains
certainly not route covering foundational Health needs
ways now somebody budget lower hundred dollars per month
spend foundational supplementation well couple discussions
now amount money devote foundational
supplementation zero course respect becomes discussion
sorts foods patterns food intake going best support mental
health physical health performance now somebody somewhere zero
dollars fifty dollars spend supplementation sake thing calling
foundational Health per month well different category supplement discussion
arises moment sort close conversation
foundational supplementation means many different things vitamins
minerals sometimes one vitamin mineral supplement means digestive


enzymes supplement combination vitamins minerals
means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based
mushroom-based formulations can buffer stress provide brain
body support often although not always believe include probiotics
prebiotics anything supports healthy gut microbiome think
broad spectrum supplement many many ingredients high quality covers
bases going best route ensuring foundational supplementation
covered think starting place supplementation
regimens say think covering foundational needs realm
vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes adaptogens going give
benefit cost benefit across board terms brain body
systems going allow feel better overall sleep better overall focus better
overall support different systems brain body going
allow best course also paying careful attention nutrition
simply cannot abandon

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go
newsletter can find toolkit can sign free toolkits like
point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

adequate calories high quality sources hormones like testosterone estrogen
will suffer one reasons women will stop periods
not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin
protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood
glucose well sex hormone binding globulin going increase dramatically
conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way
hormones insulin impact hormones free testosterone
acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases
cortisol levels cortisol levels important elevated early day
focus alertness immune function make sure cortisol levels
low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise
also relatively short meaning hour less bouts intense resistance training

start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

reported variations quality sourcing forth not aware
real differences quality water soluble fat soluble vitamins
found less expensive versus expensive vitamin mineral supplements
typically cost scales dosages different vitamins minerals
probably expected expensive obtain source vitamins
minerals tend lower quantities less expensive versions vitamin
mineral supplements just kind obvious need ask can
afford financially need ask able regularly ingest
enough foods enough variety cover vitamin mineral needs just food
people answer going immediate yes careful get
enough foods allow obtain vitamin mineral quota
individuals answer will no say people extremely
physically mentally active people perhaps following intermittent
fasting schedule not ingesting lot food general restricting food
intake specific times day well vitamin mineral supplement likely makes sense
however going important ingest vitamin mineral
supplement food ideally early day can set little bit
challenge intermittent fasters restricting feeding window late
day say well many water-soluble vitamins particular B
vitamins need ingested food otherwise can cause
stomach upset range people like can take B
vitamins empty stomach feel fine people feel really lousy take
B vitamins things talk later namely zinc
coenzyme Q10 really also taken food best time take
vitamin mineral supplement food believe going take
vitamin mineral supplement want take food don't want take

00:25:25 Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens

food intake goal health obtaining adequate amounts vitamins
minerals so-called foundational supplements include course vitamin mineral
supplements expanded last decade also include
supplements vitamins minerals also things like digestive enzymes
example indeed can get digestive enzymes
foods instance eating bit papaya even little bit Pineapple can assist
digestion certain aspects macronutrients naturally occurring
enzymes help digest things like carbohydrates fats proteins
food-based sources enzymes welcome look online just put
food based sources enzymes find nowadays lot
foundational supplements will include papain will include different lipases
anytime hear word Ace way means enzyme enzyme designed
break catalyze sort reaction biology nutrition particular
can find foundational supplements include vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes nowadays quality foundational supplements also
including things like adaptogens name adaptogens sort vague
indeed no specific operational definition something really important
understand supplementation companies indeed podcasts can talk


adaptogens without actually defining adaptogen operational way
say operational mean definition everyone given Arena
space research instance can agree talk adaptogenic
effects given compound talking things well foundational
supplements nowadays include vitamins minerals digestive enzymes so-called
adaptogens adaptogens broadly speaking thought improve body
brain's ability ability buffer various stressors things like
herbs like ashwagandha designed reduce cortisol levels sense
ashwagandha adaptogen ashwagandha effects related hormone
augmentation testosterone estrogen maybe even thyroid
Pathways talk little bit later talk supplements
hormone augmentation foundational supplements really expanded include lot
different categories nutrients micronutrients vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes designed achieve broad spectrum effects one category
supplementation think makes

00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition

sense explore multi-ingredient formulations thing often included
so-called foundational supplements probiotics prebiotics
designed augment support so-called gut microbiome gut microbiome
collection trillions little micro bacteria exist us mainly exist
mucous membrane-lined tissues body nasal passages
mouth vagina urethra gut whole way mouth
way end not just stomach trillions bacteria live trillions
microbacteria also live skin fact every time shake someone's hand
exchanging microbacteria micro bacteria often healthy us good us
support huge number positive biological functions microbacteria
live gut Elsewhere mucous line tissues can
disadvantageous us can harm health growing idea days based
number different Laboratories work including laboratory upstairs neighbor
Stanford Dr Justin Sonnenberg guest podcast great
diversity range microbiota called microbiome microbiota
microbacteria essentially referring thing microbiome whole


collection microbacteria lot different so-called species
microbacteria known advantageous immune system function hormone
function supports so-called gut brain axis important number things
including mood motivation actually supports production neurotransmitters
brain body can help keep motivated elevated mood support general
function neurons well not surprisingly ways support gut microbiome
ways harm gut microbiome refer podcast episode
Justin Sonnenberg can find hubermanlab.com want learn
different ways can support gut microbiome sake today's discussion
want emphasize methods supporting gut microbiome
direct consumption particular foods two categories foods
getting enough likely gut microbiome diverse
going support important functions just listed off functions well
two sources gut microbiota supporting foods low sugar fermented foods
things like sauerkraut kimchi Greek yogurt low sugar Greek yogurt
um kombucha particular drink things like kefir bunch varieties
fermented foods different cultures different fermented foods Japanese natto
um another source ferment good gut microbiome work
Justin sonnenberg's lab close Labs Stanford School Medicine
shown people ingest four servings day low sugar fermented foods
greatly improves function gut microbiome particular enhances
function immune system reduces so-called inflammatorium reduces
inflammation brain body ways helpful effective brain
body mental health physical health performance ways
support gut microbiome strictly food come no surprise
people not ingesting four servings day fermented foods hopefully
getting enough fiber especially Prebiotic fiber one way support gut
microbiome although studies Justin sonnenberg's lab point fact fiber
intake not directly supportive gut microbiome everybody
individuals not others no effect individuals
actually made category say array inflammatory markers worse
actually led inflammation not say fiber bad fact
episode Dr Lane Norton discussed many benefits getting
enough fiber lot reasons people get enough fiber diet


least supporting gut microbiome four servings day low sugar fermented
foods seems best way support gut microbiome intake
nutrition people not achieving therefore foundational
supplements can just vitamin mineral supplements vitamin
mineral supplements plus digestive enzymes things plus adaptogens
now also tend include prebiotics probiotics designed support
proliferation maintenance

00:33:06 Supplements Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog

enough gut microbiota order support gut microbiome gut brain axis now
importance gut microbiome people not
getting enough support gut microbiome form low sugar fermented foods
Prebiotic fiber diet think perhaps one essential foundational
supplements irrespective whether not includes vitamins minerals adaptogens
digestive enzymes way support gut microbiome now gets
whole dimension categories Prebiotic probiotic capsules one needs
careful want say Prebiotic probiotic capsules
can buy first expensive best ones going refrigerated
required Refrigeration just good low sugar fermented foods way
instance pickles low sugar fermented food can support gut microbiome
buying pickles section grocery store pickles
not refrigerated well not going get gut microbiome supporting
effects pickles funny even conversation talking
pickles reality can greatly enhance microbiota getting
pickles require refrigeration include brine liquid
around true sauerkraut non-refrigerated sauerkraut not going
support gut microbiome will supply things perhaps not going
support gut microbiome refrigerated versions reason
people not getting enough food based support gut microbiome
importance gut microbiome one key categories
foundational supplements supplements create support microbiome
prebiotics probiotics tend refrigerated varieties
ones actually going work also tend expensive


evidence taking excessive amounts prebiotics probiotics typical
capsule forms prebiotics probiotics taken ongoing not short
periods time taken ongoing can lead issues like brain fog
nice literature growing one suggestion people
going take supplements support microbiome supplements
include low enough levels small enough amounts prebiotics probiotics
don't start venture realm brain fog issues
associated taking much Prebiotic probiotic form

00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs

discovered works best many people find works really well
people approach ask often
often say going take one supplement supplement
take rather just give one specific answer actually asked three
questions first question ask well sleeping night getting
enough sleep waking feeling rested not opens
whole different set interactions need discussions around
sorts things need possibly take order get sleep right
sleep foundation mental health physical health performance will
discussion little bit later episode second question asked
nutrition eating regularly found combination
macronutrients diet right think getting enough vitamins
minerals digestion conversation third thing
ask extremely important budget somebody


ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual
components can take combination order meet foundational
needs people not interested homework legwork
figure exactly dosages one reason indeed taken
athletic green since 2012. like makes feel better energy sleep
better digestion certainly better supports gut microbiome
reason want emphasize great sources
relevant things within foundational formulas athletic greens contains
certainly not route covering foundational Health needs
ways now somebody budget lower hundred dollars per month
spend foundational supplementation well couple discussions
now amount money devote foundational
supplementation zero course respect becomes discussion
sorts foods patterns food intake going best support mental
health physical health performance now somebody somewhere zero
dollars fifty dollars spend supplementation sake thing calling
foundational Health per month well different category supplement discussion
arises moment sort close conversation
foundational supplementation means many different things vitamins
minerals sometimes one vitamin mineral supplement means digestive


enzymes supplement combination vitamins minerals
means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based
mushroom-based formulations can buffer stress provide brain
body support often although not always believe include probiotics
prebiotics anything supports healthy gut microbiome think
broad spectrum supplement many many ingredients high quality covers
bases going best route ensuring foundational supplementation
covered think starting place supplementation
regimens say think covering foundational needs realm
vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes adaptogens going give
benefit cost benefit across board terms brain body
systems going allow feel better overall sleep better overall focus better
overall support different systems brain body going
allow best course also paying careful attention nutrition
simply cannot abandon

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect

can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

will suffer one reasons women will stop periods
not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin
protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood

conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way

acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge

episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition

common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

00:25:25 Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens

food intake goal health obtaining adequate amounts vitamins
minerals so-called foundational supplements include course vitamin mineral
supplements expanded last decade also include
supplements vitamins minerals also things like digestive enzymes
example indeed can get digestive enzymes
foods instance eating bit papaya even little bit Pineapple can assist
digestion certain aspects macronutrients naturally occurring
enzymes help digest things like carbohydrates fats proteins
food-based sources enzymes welcome look online just put
food based sources enzymes find nowadays lot
foundational supplements will include papain will include different lipases
anytime hear word Ace way means enzyme enzyme designed
break catalyze sort reaction biology nutrition particular
can find foundational supplements include vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes nowadays quality foundational supplements also
including things like adaptogens name adaptogens sort vague
indeed no specific operational definition something really important
understand supplementation companies indeed podcasts can talk


adaptogens without actually defining adaptogen operational way
say operational mean definition everyone given Arena
space research instance can agree talk adaptogenic
effects given compound talking things well foundational
supplements nowadays include vitamins minerals digestive enzymes so-called
adaptogens adaptogens broadly speaking thought improve body
brain's ability ability buffer various stressors things like
herbs like ashwagandha designed reduce cortisol levels sense
ashwagandha adaptogen ashwagandha effects related hormone
augmentation testosterone estrogen maybe even thyroid
Pathways talk little bit later talk supplements
hormone augmentation foundational supplements really expanded include lot
different categories nutrients micronutrients vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes designed achieve broad spectrum effects one category
supplementation think makes

00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition

sense explore multi-ingredient formulations thing often included
so-called foundational supplements probiotics prebiotics
designed augment support so-called gut microbiome gut microbiome
collection trillions little micro bacteria exist us mainly exist
mucous membrane-lined tissues body nasal passages
mouth vagina urethra gut whole way mouth
way end not just stomach trillions bacteria live trillions
microbacteria also live skin fact every time shake someone's hand
exchanging microbacteria micro bacteria often healthy us good us
support huge number positive biological functions microbacteria
live gut Elsewhere mucous line tissues can
disadvantageous us can harm health growing idea days based
number different Laboratories work including laboratory upstairs neighbor
Stanford Dr Justin Sonnenberg guest podcast great
diversity range microbiota called microbiome microbiota
microbacteria essentially referring thing microbiome whole


collection microbacteria lot different so-called species
microbacteria known advantageous immune system function hormone
function supports so-called gut brain axis important number things
including mood motivation actually supports production neurotransmitters
brain body can help keep motivated elevated mood support general
function neurons well not surprisingly ways support gut microbiome
ways harm gut microbiome refer podcast episode
Justin Sonnenberg can find hubermanlab.com want learn
different ways can support gut microbiome sake today's discussion
want emphasize methods supporting gut microbiome
direct consumption particular foods two categories foods
getting enough likely gut microbiome diverse
going support important functions just listed off functions well
two sources gut microbiota supporting foods low sugar fermented foods
things like sauerkraut kimchi Greek yogurt low sugar Greek yogurt
um kombucha particular drink things like kefir bunch varieties
fermented foods different cultures different fermented foods Japanese natto
um another source ferment good gut microbiome work
Justin sonnenberg's lab close Labs Stanford School Medicine
shown people ingest four servings day low sugar fermented foods
greatly improves function gut microbiome particular enhances
function immune system reduces so-called inflammatorium reduces
inflammation brain body ways helpful effective brain
body mental health physical health performance ways
support gut microbiome strictly food come no surprise
people not ingesting four servings day fermented foods hopefully
getting enough fiber especially Prebiotic fiber one way support gut
microbiome although studies Justin sonnenberg's lab point fact fiber
intake not directly supportive gut microbiome everybody
individuals not others no effect individuals
actually made category say array inflammatory markers worse
actually led inflammation not say fiber bad fact
episode Dr Lane Norton discussed many benefits getting
enough fiber lot reasons people get enough fiber diet


least supporting gut microbiome four servings day low sugar fermented
foods seems best way support gut microbiome intake
nutrition people not achieving therefore foundational
supplements can just vitamin mineral supplements vitamin
mineral supplements plus digestive enzymes things plus adaptogens
now also tend include prebiotics probiotics designed support
proliferation maintenance

00:33:06 Supplements Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog

enough gut microbiota order support gut microbiome gut brain axis now
importance gut microbiome people not
getting enough support gut microbiome form low sugar fermented foods
Prebiotic fiber diet think perhaps one essential foundational
supplements irrespective whether not includes vitamins minerals adaptogens
digestive enzymes way support gut microbiome now gets
whole dimension categories Prebiotic probiotic capsules one needs
careful want say Prebiotic probiotic capsules
can buy first expensive best ones going refrigerated
required Refrigeration just good low sugar fermented foods way
instance pickles low sugar fermented food can support gut microbiome
buying pickles section grocery store pickles
not refrigerated well not going get gut microbiome supporting
effects pickles funny even conversation talking
pickles reality can greatly enhance microbiota getting
pickles require refrigeration include brine liquid
around true sauerkraut non-refrigerated sauerkraut not going
support gut microbiome will supply things perhaps not going
support gut microbiome refrigerated versions reason
people not getting enough food based support gut microbiome
importance gut microbiome one key categories
foundational supplements supplements create support microbiome
prebiotics probiotics tend refrigerated varieties
ones actually going work also tend expensive


evidence taking excessive amounts prebiotics probiotics typical
capsule forms prebiotics probiotics taken ongoing not short
periods time taken ongoing can lead issues like brain fog
nice literature growing one suggestion people
going take supplements support microbiome supplements
include low enough levels small enough amounts prebiotics probiotics
don't start venture realm brain fog issues
associated taking much Prebiotic probiotic form

00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs

discovered works best many people find works really well
people approach ask often
often say going take one supplement supplement
take rather just give one specific answer actually asked three
questions first question ask well sleeping night getting
enough sleep waking feeling rested not opens
whole different set interactions need discussions around
sorts things need possibly take order get sleep right
sleep foundation mental health physical health performance will
discussion little bit later episode second question asked
nutrition eating regularly found combination
macronutrients diet right think getting enough vitamins
minerals digestion conversation third thing
ask extremely important budget somebody


ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual
components can take combination order meet foundational
needs people not interested homework legwork
figure exactly dosages one reason indeed taken
athletic green since 2012. like makes feel better energy sleep
better digestion certainly better supports gut microbiome
reason want emphasize great sources
relevant things within foundational formulas athletic greens contains
certainly not route covering foundational Health needs
ways now somebody budget lower hundred dollars per month
spend foundational supplementation well couple discussions
now amount money devote foundational
supplementation zero course respect becomes discussion
sorts foods patterns food intake going best support mental
health physical health performance now somebody somewhere zero
dollars fifty dollars spend supplementation sake thing calling
foundational Health per month well different category supplement discussion
arises moment sort close conversation
foundational supplementation means many different things vitamins
minerals sometimes one vitamin mineral supplement means digestive


enzymes supplement combination vitamins minerals
means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based
mushroom-based formulations can buffer stress provide brain
body support often although not always believe include probiotics
prebiotics anything supports healthy gut microbiome think
broad spectrum supplement many many ingredients high quality covers
bases going best route ensuring foundational supplementation
covered think starting place supplementation
regimens say think covering foundational needs realm
vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes adaptogens going give
benefit cost benefit across board terms brain body
systems going allow feel better overall sleep better overall focus better
overall support different systems brain body going
allow best course also paying careful attention nutrition
simply cannot abandon

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go
newsletter can find toolkit can sign free toolkits like
point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin

hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

adaptogens without actually defining adaptogen operational way
say operational mean definition everyone given Arena
space research instance can agree talk adaptogenic
effects given compound talking things well foundational
supplements nowadays include vitamins minerals digestive enzymes so-called
adaptogens adaptogens broadly speaking thought improve body
brain's ability ability buffer various stressors things like
herbs like ashwagandha designed reduce cortisol levels sense
ashwagandha adaptogen ashwagandha effects related hormone
augmentation testosterone estrogen maybe even thyroid
Pathways talk little bit later talk supplements
hormone augmentation foundational supplements really expanded include lot
different categories nutrients micronutrients vitamins minerals digestive
enzymes designed achieve broad spectrum effects one category
supplementation think makes

00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition

sense explore multi-ingredient formulations thing often included
so-called foundational supplements probiotics prebiotics
designed augment support so-called gut microbiome gut microbiome
collection trillions little micro bacteria exist us mainly exist
mucous membrane-lined tissues body nasal passages
mouth vagina urethra gut whole way mouth
way end not just stomach trillions bacteria live trillions
microbacteria also live skin fact every time shake someone's hand
exchanging microbacteria micro bacteria often healthy us good us
support huge number positive biological functions microbacteria
live gut Elsewhere mucous line tissues can
disadvantageous us can harm health growing idea days based
number different Laboratories work including laboratory upstairs neighbor
Stanford Dr Justin Sonnenberg guest podcast great
diversity range microbiota called microbiome microbiota
microbacteria essentially referring thing microbiome whole


collection microbacteria lot different so-called species
microbacteria known advantageous immune system function hormone
function supports so-called gut brain axis important number things
including mood motivation actually supports production neurotransmitters
brain body can help keep motivated elevated mood support general
function neurons well not surprisingly ways support gut microbiome
ways harm gut microbiome refer podcast episode
Justin Sonnenberg can find hubermanlab.com want learn
different ways can support gut microbiome sake today's discussion
want emphasize methods supporting gut microbiome
direct consumption particular foods two categories foods
getting enough likely gut microbiome diverse
going support important functions just listed off functions well
two sources gut microbiota supporting foods low sugar fermented foods
things like sauerkraut kimchi Greek yogurt low sugar Greek yogurt
um kombucha particular drink things like kefir bunch varieties
fermented foods different cultures different fermented foods Japanese natto
um another source ferment good gut microbiome work
Justin sonnenberg's lab close Labs Stanford School Medicine
shown people ingest four servings day low sugar fermented foods
greatly improves function gut microbiome particular enhances
function immune system reduces so-called inflammatorium reduces
inflammation brain body ways helpful effective brain
body mental health physical health performance ways
support gut microbiome strictly food come no surprise
people not ingesting four servings day fermented foods hopefully
getting enough fiber especially Prebiotic fiber one way support gut
microbiome although studies Justin sonnenberg's lab point fact fiber
intake not directly supportive gut microbiome everybody
individuals not others no effect individuals
actually made category say array inflammatory markers worse
actually led inflammation not say fiber bad fact
episode Dr Lane Norton discussed many benefits getting
enough fiber lot reasons people get enough fiber diet


least supporting gut microbiome four servings day low sugar fermented
foods seems best way support gut microbiome intake
nutrition people not achieving therefore foundational
supplements can just vitamin mineral supplements vitamin
mineral supplements plus digestive enzymes things plus adaptogens
now also tend include prebiotics probiotics designed support
proliferation maintenance

00:33:06 Supplements Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog

enough gut microbiota order support gut microbiome gut brain axis now
importance gut microbiome people not
getting enough support gut microbiome form low sugar fermented foods
Prebiotic fiber diet think perhaps one essential foundational
supplements irrespective whether not includes vitamins minerals adaptogens
digestive enzymes way support gut microbiome now gets
whole dimension categories Prebiotic probiotic capsules one needs
careful want say Prebiotic probiotic capsules
can buy first expensive best ones going refrigerated
required Refrigeration just good low sugar fermented foods way
instance pickles low sugar fermented food can support gut microbiome
buying pickles section grocery store pickles
not refrigerated well not going get gut microbiome supporting
effects pickles funny even conversation talking
pickles reality can greatly enhance microbiota getting
pickles require refrigeration include brine liquid
around true sauerkraut non-refrigerated sauerkraut not going
support gut microbiome will supply things perhaps not going
support gut microbiome refrigerated versions reason
people not getting enough food based support gut microbiome
importance gut microbiome one key categories
foundational supplements supplements create support microbiome
prebiotics probiotics tend refrigerated varieties
ones actually going work also tend expensive


evidence taking excessive amounts prebiotics probiotics typical
capsule forms prebiotics probiotics taken ongoing not short
periods time taken ongoing can lead issues like brain fog
nice literature growing one suggestion people
going take supplements support microbiome supplements
include low enough levels small enough amounts prebiotics probiotics
don't start venture realm brain fog issues
associated taking much Prebiotic probiotic form
supplements like take brief break thank sponsor inside tracker inside

micronutrients herbs sometimes go mushroom category
non psychedelic mushrooms provide either buffering stress system
reducing cortisol typically thought known based research studies


enhance things like blood flow brain enhance aspect cognitive

adaptogens important one get back little bit later reason mention
now indeed hard get so-called adaptogens sufficient concentrations
food-based sources assume people aren't collecting
chaga mushroom ashwagandha herbs combining salads

00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs

discovered works best many people find works really well
people approach ask often
often say going take one supplement supplement
take rather just give one specific answer actually asked three
questions first question ask well sleeping night getting
enough sleep waking feeling rested not opens
whole different set interactions need discussions around
sorts things need possibly take order get sleep right
sleep foundation mental health physical health performance will
discussion little bit later episode second question asked
nutrition eating regularly found combination
macronutrients diet right think getting enough vitamins
minerals digestion conversation third thing
ask extremely important budget somebody


ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go

point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin

hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting

acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important

start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us

said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

collection microbacteria lot different so-called species
microbacteria known advantageous immune system function hormone
function supports so-called gut brain axis important number things
including mood motivation actually supports production neurotransmitters
brain body can help keep motivated elevated mood support general
function neurons well not surprisingly ways support gut microbiome
ways harm gut microbiome refer podcast episode
Justin Sonnenberg can find hubermanlab.com want learn
different ways can support gut microbiome sake today's discussion
want emphasize methods supporting gut microbiome
direct consumption particular foods two categories foods
getting enough likely gut microbiome diverse
going support important functions just listed off functions well
two sources gut microbiota supporting foods low sugar fermented foods
things like sauerkraut kimchi Greek yogurt low sugar Greek yogurt
um kombucha particular drink things like kefir bunch varieties
fermented foods different cultures different fermented foods Japanese natto
um another source ferment good gut microbiome work
Justin sonnenberg's lab close Labs Stanford School Medicine
shown people ingest four servings day low sugar fermented foods
greatly improves function gut microbiome particular enhances
function immune system reduces so-called inflammatorium reduces
inflammation brain body ways helpful effective brain
body mental health physical health performance ways
support gut microbiome strictly food come no surprise
people not ingesting four servings day fermented foods hopefully
getting enough fiber especially Prebiotic fiber one way support gut
microbiome although studies Justin sonnenberg's lab point fact fiber
intake not directly supportive gut microbiome everybody
individuals not others no effect individuals
actually made category say array inflammatory markers worse
actually led inflammation not say fiber bad fact
episode Dr Lane Norton discussed many benefits getting
enough fiber lot reasons people get enough fiber diet


least supporting gut microbiome four servings day low sugar fermented
foods seems best way support gut microbiome intake
nutrition people not achieving therefore foundational
supplements can just vitamin mineral supplements vitamin
mineral supplements plus digestive enzymes things plus adaptogens
now also tend include prebiotics probiotics designed support
proliferation maintenance

00:33:06 Supplements Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog

enough gut microbiota order support gut microbiome gut brain axis now
importance gut microbiome people not
getting enough support gut microbiome form low sugar fermented foods
Prebiotic fiber diet think perhaps one essential foundational
supplements irrespective whether not includes vitamins minerals adaptogens
digestive enzymes way support gut microbiome now gets
whole dimension categories Prebiotic probiotic capsules one needs
careful want say Prebiotic probiotic capsules
can buy first expensive best ones going refrigerated
required Refrigeration just good low sugar fermented foods way
instance pickles low sugar fermented food can support gut microbiome
buying pickles section grocery store pickles
not refrigerated well not going get gut microbiome supporting
effects pickles funny even conversation talking
pickles reality can greatly enhance microbiota getting
pickles require refrigeration include brine liquid
around true sauerkraut non-refrigerated sauerkraut not going
support gut microbiome will supply things perhaps not going
support gut microbiome refrigerated versions reason
people not getting enough food based support gut microbiome
importance gut microbiome one key categories
foundational supplements supplements create support microbiome
prebiotics probiotics tend refrigerated varieties
ones actually going work also tend expensive


evidence taking excessive amounts prebiotics probiotics typical
capsule forms prebiotics probiotics taken ongoing not short
periods time taken ongoing can lead issues like brain fog
nice literature growing one suggestion people
going take supplements support microbiome supplements
include low enough levels small enough amounts prebiotics probiotics
don't start venture realm brain fog issues
associated taking much Prebiotic probiotic form

00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs

discovered works best many people find works really well
people approach ask often
often say going take one supplement supplement
take rather just give one specific answer actually asked three
questions first question ask well sleeping night getting
enough sleep waking feeling rested not opens
whole different set interactions need discussions around
sorts things need possibly take order get sleep right
sleep foundation mental health physical health performance will
discussion little bit later episode second question asked
nutrition eating regularly found combination
macronutrients diet right think getting enough vitamins
minerals digestion conversation third thing
ask extremely important budget somebody


ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual
components can take combination order meet foundational
needs people not interested homework legwork
figure exactly dosages one reason indeed taken
athletic green since 2012. like makes feel better energy sleep
better digestion certainly better supports gut microbiome
reason want emphasize great sources
relevant things within foundational formulas athletic greens contains
certainly not route covering foundational Health needs
ways now somebody budget lower hundred dollars per month
spend foundational supplementation well couple discussions
now amount money devote foundational
supplementation zero course respect becomes discussion
sorts foods patterns food intake going best support mental
health physical health performance now somebody somewhere zero
dollars fifty dollars spend supplementation sake thing calling
foundational Health per month well different category supplement discussion
arises moment sort close conversation
foundational supplementation means many different things vitamins
minerals sometimes one vitamin mineral supplement means digestive


enzymes supplement combination vitamins minerals
means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based
mushroom-based formulations can buffer stress provide brain
body support often although not always believe include probiotics
prebiotics anything supports healthy gut microbiome think
broad spectrum supplement many many ingredients high quality covers
bases going best route ensuring foundational supplementation
covered think starting place supplementation
regimens say think covering foundational needs realm
vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes adaptogens going give
benefit cost benefit across board terms brain body
systems going allow feel better overall sleep better overall focus better
overall support different systems brain body going
allow best course also paying careful attention nutrition
simply cannot abandon

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go
newsletter can find toolkit can sign free toolkits like
point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin

hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting

acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

nutrition people not achieving therefore foundational
supplements can just vitamin mineral supplements vitamin
mineral supplements plus digestive enzymes things plus adaptogens
now also tend include prebiotics probiotics designed support
proliferation maintenance

00:33:06 Supplements Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog

enough gut microbiota order support gut microbiome gut brain axis now
importance gut microbiome people not
getting enough support gut microbiome form low sugar fermented foods
Prebiotic fiber diet think perhaps one essential foundational
supplements irrespective whether not includes vitamins minerals adaptogens
digestive enzymes way support gut microbiome now gets
whole dimension categories Prebiotic probiotic capsules one needs
careful want say Prebiotic probiotic capsules
can buy first expensive best ones going refrigerated
required Refrigeration just good low sugar fermented foods way
instance pickles low sugar fermented food can support gut microbiome
buying pickles section grocery store pickles
not refrigerated well not going get gut microbiome supporting
effects pickles funny even conversation talking
pickles reality can greatly enhance microbiota getting
pickles require refrigeration include brine liquid
around true sauerkraut non-refrigerated sauerkraut not going
support gut microbiome will supply things perhaps not going
support gut microbiome refrigerated versions reason
people not getting enough food based support gut microbiome
importance gut microbiome one key categories
foundational supplements supplements create support microbiome
prebiotics probiotics tend refrigerated varieties
ones actually going work also tend expensive


evidence taking excessive amounts prebiotics probiotics typical
capsule forms prebiotics probiotics taken ongoing not short
periods time taken ongoing can lead issues like brain fog
nice literature growing one suggestion people
going take supplements support microbiome supplements
include low enough levels small enough amounts prebiotics probiotics
don't start venture realm brain fog issues

00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs

discovered works best many people find works really well
people approach ask often
often say going take one supplement supplement
take rather just give one specific answer actually asked three
questions first question ask well sleeping night getting
enough sleep waking feeling rested not opens
whole different set interactions need discussions around
sorts things need possibly take order get sleep right
sleep foundation mental health physical health performance will
discussion little bit later episode second question asked
nutrition eating regularly found combination
macronutrients diet right think getting enough vitamins
minerals digestion conversation third thing
ask extremely important budget somebody


ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual
components can take combination order meet foundational
needs people not interested homework legwork
figure exactly dosages one reason indeed taken
athletic green since 2012. like makes feel better energy sleep
better digestion certainly better supports gut microbiome
reason want emphasize great sources
relevant things within foundational formulas athletic greens contains
certainly not route covering foundational Health needs
ways now somebody budget lower hundred dollars per month
spend foundational supplementation well couple discussions
now amount money devote foundational
supplementation zero course respect becomes discussion
sorts foods patterns food intake going best support mental
health physical health performance now somebody somewhere zero
dollars fifty dollars spend supplementation sake thing calling
foundational Health per month well different category supplement discussion
arises moment sort close conversation
foundational supplementation means many different things vitamins
minerals sometimes one vitamin mineral supplement means digestive


enzymes supplement combination vitamins minerals
means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based
mushroom-based formulations can buffer stress provide brain
body support often although not always believe include probiotics
prebiotics anything supports healthy gut microbiome think
broad spectrum supplement many many ingredients high quality covers
bases going best route ensuring foundational supplementation
covered think starting place supplementation
regimens say think covering foundational needs realm
vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes adaptogens going give
benefit cost benefit across board terms brain body
systems going allow feel better overall sleep better overall focus better
overall support different systems brain body going
allow best course also paying careful attention nutrition
simply cannot abandon

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go
newsletter can find toolkit can sign free toolkits like
point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

will suffer one reasons women will stop periods
not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin
protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood

conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way

acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases

start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can

brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue

particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil

cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one

kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based

supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs

discovered works best many people find works really well
people approach ask often
often say going take one supplement supplement
take rather just give one specific answer actually asked three
questions first question ask well sleeping night getting
enough sleep waking feeling rested not opens
whole different set interactions need discussions around
sorts things need possibly take order get sleep right
sleep foundation mental health physical health performance will
discussion little bit later episode second question asked
nutrition eating regularly found combination
macronutrients diet right think getting enough vitamins
minerals digestion conversation third thing
ask extremely important budget somebody


ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual
components can take combination order meet foundational
needs people not interested homework legwork
figure exactly dosages one reason indeed taken
athletic green since 2012. like makes feel better energy sleep
better digestion certainly better supports gut microbiome
reason want emphasize great sources
relevant things within foundational formulas athletic greens contains
certainly not route covering foundational Health needs
ways now somebody budget lower hundred dollars per month
spend foundational supplementation well couple discussions
now amount money devote foundational
supplementation zero course respect becomes discussion
sorts foods patterns food intake going best support mental
health physical health performance now somebody somewhere zero
dollars fifty dollars spend supplementation sake thing calling
foundational Health per month well different category supplement discussion
arises moment sort close conversation
foundational supplementation means many different things vitamins
minerals sometimes one vitamin mineral supplement means digestive


enzymes supplement combination vitamins minerals
means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based
mushroom-based formulations can buffer stress provide brain
body support often although not always believe include probiotics
prebiotics anything supports healthy gut microbiome think
broad spectrum supplement many many ingredients high quality covers
bases going best route ensuring foundational supplementation
covered think starting place supplementation
regimens say think covering foundational needs realm
vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes adaptogens going give
benefit cost benefit across board terms brain body
systems going allow feel better overall sleep better overall focus better
overall support different systems brain body going
allow best course also paying careful attention nutrition
simply cannot abandon

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go

point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin

hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting

acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important

focus alertness immune function make sure cortisol levels
low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise
also relatively short meaning hour less bouts intense resistance training

testosterone estrogen also vast discussion thyroid hormone Etc
covered topics previous episodes behavioral

start thinking supplementation hormones repeat get
nutrition behaviors correct sake hormones health
purposes start thinking supplementation hormones certainly


start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs

discovered works best many people find works really well
people approach ask often
often say going take one supplement supplement
take rather just give one specific answer actually asked three
questions first question ask well sleeping night getting
enough sleep waking feeling rested not opens
whole different set interactions need discussions around
sorts things need possibly take order get sleep right
sleep foundation mental health physical health performance will
discussion little bit later episode second question asked
nutrition eating regularly found combination
macronutrients diet right think getting enough vitamins
minerals digestion conversation third thing
ask extremely important budget somebody


ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual
components can take combination order meet foundational
needs people not interested homework legwork
figure exactly dosages one reason indeed taken
athletic green since 2012. like makes feel better energy sleep
better digestion certainly better supports gut microbiome
reason want emphasize great sources
relevant things within foundational formulas athletic greens contains
certainly not route covering foundational Health needs
ways now somebody budget lower hundred dollars per month
spend foundational supplementation well couple discussions
now amount money devote foundational
supplementation zero course respect becomes discussion
sorts foods patterns food intake going best support mental
health physical health performance now somebody somewhere zero
dollars fifty dollars spend supplementation sake thing calling
foundational Health per month well different category supplement discussion
arises moment sort close conversation
foundational supplementation means many different things vitamins
minerals sometimes one vitamin mineral supplement means digestive


enzymes supplement combination vitamins minerals
means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based
mushroom-based formulations can buffer stress provide brain
body support often although not always believe include probiotics
prebiotics anything supports healthy gut microbiome think
broad spectrum supplement many many ingredients high quality covers
bases going best route ensuring foundational supplementation
covered think starting place supplementation
regimens say think covering foundational needs realm
vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes adaptogens going give
benefit cost benefit across board terms brain body
systems going allow feel better overall sleep better overall focus better
overall support different systems brain body going
allow best course also paying careful attention nutrition
simply cannot abandon

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go
newsletter can find toolkit can sign free toolkits like
point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood

conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way

acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

ten dollars month total spend supplements versus thousand dollars month
spend supplements total well different set conversations
supplements take now three questions
answered assuming somebody able spend hundred dollars
supplements per month recommendation not focus specific
supplements directed towards sleep toward Focus hormone augmentation
rather focus buffering enhancing foundational nutrition adaptogens
probiotics prebiotics digestive enzymes simple fact
going raise tide biological organ systems going
lead enhanced mental health physical health performance including sleep
one reason people say well can take one supplement
take say well budget say can meet hundred dollar threshold
per month recommendation athletic greens something like
invest time energy go find various combinations vitamins
minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens forth individual
components can take combination order meet foundational
needs people not interested homework legwork
figure exactly dosages one reason indeed taken
athletic green since 2012. like makes feel better energy sleep
better digestion certainly better supports gut microbiome
reason want emphasize great sources
relevant things within foundational formulas athletic greens contains
certainly not route covering foundational Health needs
ways now somebody budget lower hundred dollars per month
spend foundational supplementation well couple discussions
now amount money devote foundational
supplementation zero course respect becomes discussion
sorts foods patterns food intake going best support mental
health physical health performance now somebody somewhere zero
dollars fifty dollars spend supplementation sake thing calling
foundational Health per month well different category supplement discussion
arises moment sort close conversation
foundational supplementation means many different things vitamins
minerals sometimes one vitamin mineral supplement means digestive


enzymes supplement combination vitamins minerals
means often not always adaptogens things like ashwagandha different plant-based
mushroom-based formulations can buffer stress provide brain
body support often although not always believe include probiotics
prebiotics anything supports healthy gut microbiome think
broad spectrum supplement many many ingredients high quality covers
bases going best route ensuring foundational supplementation
covered think starting place supplementation
regimens say think covering foundational needs realm
vitamins minerals probiotics digestive enzymes adaptogens going give
benefit cost benefit across board terms brain body
systems going allow feel better overall sleep better overall focus better
overall support different systems brain body going
allow best course also paying careful attention nutrition
simply cannot abandon

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go
newsletter can find toolkit can sign free toolkits like
point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

specific time points topic happens covered now Hormone Health
important topic discuss context supplementation indeed

behavioral tools nutrition-based tools least top Contour coverage
way frames discussion supplementation appropriately
context hormone support augmentation optimization not getting
adequate calories high quality sources hormones like testosterone estrogen
will suffer one reasons women will stop periods
not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin
protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood
glucose well sex hormone binding globulin going increase dramatically
conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way
hormones insulin impact hormones free testosterone
acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases
cortisol levels cortisol levels important elevated early day
focus alertness immune function make sure cortisol levels
low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise
also relatively short meaning hour less bouts intense resistance training
times per week can also dramatically alter hormone profiles fact episode
Dr Duncan French find episode hubermanlab.com
described strenuous still brief two day week protocol using resistance
training specifically increase testosterone free testosterone growth hormone
nutrition matters exercise matters comes increasing supporting
augmenting different hormones just discussion testosterone free
testosterone estrogen also vast discussion thyroid hormone Etc
covered topics previous episodes behavioral
tools place right things avoiding wrong things
right things support hormones avoiding things diminish
hormones ways can detrimental nutrition place support
hormones makes sense turn consider supplements can support
hormones believe want get behaviors nutrition correct
start thinking supplementation hormones repeat get
nutrition behaviors correct sake hormones health
purposes start thinking supplementation hormones certainly


start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called

enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge

find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

00:43:45 Supplements Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine

nutrition Better Living Chemistry still requires Better Living now
discussion foundational supplementation highlighting
fact one category supplementation multi-ingredient formulations
make sense like now shift attention single ingredient formulation
supplements designed achieve specific endpoints rather
focus specific ingredients supplements achieve specific endpoints
done already episodes related sleep focus Etc like take step
back focus larger theme today's episode think
supplementation rational cost effective biologically effective way
categories three categories going cover sleep hormone
support cognitive enhancement focus cognitive enhancement focus
final third category talk sleep rational approach thinking
supplementation sleep mentioned earlier episode many previous
episodes podcast sleep foundation mental health physical health
performance might somebody can all-nighter feel okay next
day maybe even great everybody start minimal sleep


one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go

point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

context hormone support augmentation optimization not getting
adequate calories high quality sources hormones like testosterone estrogen
will suffer one reasons women will stop periods
not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin
protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood
glucose well sex hormone binding globulin going increase dramatically
conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way
hormones insulin impact hormones free testosterone
acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases
cortisol levels cortisol levels important elevated early day
focus alertness immune function make sure cortisol levels
low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise
also relatively short meaning hour less bouts intense resistance training
times per week can also dramatically alter hormone profiles fact episode
Dr Duncan French find episode hubermanlab.com
described strenuous still brief two day week protocol using resistance
training specifically increase testosterone free testosterone growth hormone
nutrition matters exercise matters comes increasing supporting
augmenting different hormones just discussion testosterone free
testosterone estrogen also vast discussion thyroid hormone Etc
covered topics previous episodes behavioral
tools place right things avoiding wrong things

purposes start thinking supplementation hormones certainly


start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

one two nights form broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep sleeping
wrong time night thing day start suffer mood starts
suffer cognitive Clarity performance starts suffer mental health can
suffer severely physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything
suffers conversely people sleeping well deeply enough eighty
percent nights life mental health physical health performance
flourish think people start almost amazed well
various domains life previously might struggled sleep
fundamental established thinking supplementation sleep
need ask number important questions first ask
well deeply much sleeping per night assuming
somebody can fall asleep easily stay asleep night wake
feeling relatively rested maybe little groggy can move day
plenty energy focus not falling asleep class work behind
wheel whereas passenger public transportation well probably getting
enough sleep way perfectly normal require anywhere 10 minute
90 minute nap afternoon people not napper no big deal
known naps can disrupt nighttime sleep provided early enough
day take nap still able fall asleep night naps fine
somebody doesn't like naps wake groggy grumpy
often happens certain people don't nap certainly not need nap
feeling energetic throughout day chances getting enough
sleep night people course struggling sleep either falling
asleep staying asleep not feeling alert enough day
makes sense step back take look supplementation
can provide one people not sleeping enough well enough
night suffering day whatever way mild severe two
questions ask first ingesting caffeine 2 pm
answer yes want limit eliminate caffeine 2 pm maybe even push back
noon earlier know can excruciating folks can really help
ability fall stay asleep night second thing people
well avoid food within two hours prior bedtime course don't want
hungry can't fall asleep right nutrition behavioral
tools everyone needs consider not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m onwards


not eating excessively immediately prior bedtime within two hours
prior bedtime not hungry go sleep well certain
supplements can support sleep talked perfect
sleep episode episode guest expert Matt Walker University
California Berkeley master sleep episode tool kit sleep
can access zero cost going hearinglab.com going menu go
newsletter can find toolkit can sign free toolkits like
point not go systematically supplements
beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood
glucose well sex hormone binding globulin going increase dramatically
conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way
hormones insulin impact hormones free testosterone
acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases
cortisol levels cortisol levels important elevated early day
focus alertness immune function make sure cortisol levels
low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise
also relatively short meaning hour less bouts intense resistance training
times per week can also dramatically alter hormone profiles fact episode
Dr Duncan French find episode hubermanlab.com
described strenuous still brief two day week protocol using resistance
training specifically increase testosterone free testosterone growth hormone
nutrition matters exercise matters comes increasing supporting
augmenting different hormones just discussion testosterone free
testosterone estrogen also vast discussion thyroid hormone Etc
covered topics previous episodes behavioral
tools place right things avoiding wrong things
right things support hormones avoiding things diminish
hormones ways can detrimental nutrition place support
hormones makes sense turn consider supplements can support
hormones believe want get behaviors nutrition correct
start thinking supplementation hormones repeat get
nutrition behaviors correct sake hormones health
purposes start thinking supplementation hormones certainly


start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

beneficial shown beneficial sleep rather address specific
aspects sleep can suffer certain patterns supplementation
can support alleviate pain points instance somebody falls
asleep just fine wakes middle night around 2 3 A.M time
matter trouble falling back asleep two categories supplements
might want consider first myoinositol typically taken 900 milligrams
myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten amount time takes fall back
asleep wake middle night myoinositol beneficial uses
well mood Etc like see many different effects
explored scientific literature myoinositol can go examine.com
excellent site not just inositol supplements matter talks
human effect Matrix different effects different supplement compounds
different aspects hormone brain body Health evidence strong
evidence weak links studies examine.com amazing
website wonderful website provided rich resource know
many many people people wake middle night will wake
dreams intense dreams vivid
suddenly jolted dreams people well avoid
certain supplements moment talk value supplement called
theanine falling asleep theanine typically taken dosages anywhere
100 milligrams 400 milligrams depending body weight experience
find effective minimally effective well Indian can
great many people people excessively vivid dreams
excessively vivid dreams can lead immediate waking sometimes little bit
anxiety upon waking middle night people wake
middle night jolted mentally physically sleep intense


dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

will suffer one reasons women will stop periods
not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin
protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood

conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way
hormones insulin impact hormones free testosterone
acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases

low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

dreams well avoid theanine supplementation talked bit
something think lot

00:50:52 Supplements Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin

nighttime middle night wakers might familiar want take
consideration now not waking middle night
not excessively vivid dreams trouble falling asleep two
supplements particular shown effective shortening transition
time sleep allowing people ease sleep readily
magnesium 3 8 interchangeable magnesium bis glycinate magnesium
bisclycinate magnesium threonate transporter systems allow
readily cross blood-brain barrier lead mild form drowsiness mild
sense not going prevent operating motor vehicle kind
conditions emergency might arise middle night
rise middle night still able function not like sleeping pill
people take often find transition time sleep much faster
sleep also much deeper incidentally supplements also thought
useful cognitive support neuroprotection although less data
okay falling asleep one category either magnesium magnesium three
eight bis glycine interchangeable assisting transition time
sleep supplement apogenin API g-e-n-i-n apogenin
derivative chamomile talked various podcasts also acts
bit anxiety lowering compound essential prior sleep people
essentially turn off thinking able reduce amount ruminating
problem solving future anticipation requirement
falling asleep rational approach supplementing way allows
fall asleep quickly stay asleep well immediately take magnesium
three Nate apogenin together well depends budget just
simply want fall asleep quicker don't care two ingredients
going effective well try one instance magnesium
three eight try perhaps week see affects latency
sleep time quickly fall asleep can try apogenic first week
combine try magnesium three night week


switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

specific time points topic happens covered now Hormone Health
important topic discuss context supplementation indeed

behavioral tools nutrition-based tools least top Contour coverage
way frames discussion supplementation appropriately
context hormone support augmentation optimization not getting
adequate calories high quality sources hormones like testosterone estrogen
will suffer one reasons women will stop periods
not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin
protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood
glucose well sex hormone binding globulin going increase dramatically
conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way
hormones insulin impact hormones free testosterone
acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases
cortisol levels cortisol levels important elevated early day
focus alertness immune function make sure cortisol levels
low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise
also relatively short meaning hour less bouts intense resistance training
times per week can also dramatically alter hormone profiles fact episode
Dr Duncan French find episode hubermanlab.com
described strenuous still brief two day week protocol using resistance
training specifically increase testosterone free testosterone growth hormone
nutrition matters exercise matters comes increasing supporting
augmenting different hormones just discussion testosterone free
testosterone estrogen also vast discussion thyroid hormone Etc
covered topics previous episodes behavioral
tools place right things avoiding wrong things
right things support hormones avoiding things diminish
hormones ways can detrimental nutrition place support
hormones makes sense turn consider supplements can support
hormones believe want get behaviors nutrition correct
start thinking supplementation hormones repeat get
nutrition behaviors correct sake hormones health
purposes start thinking supplementation hormones certainly


start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

switch apogenin week evaluate one works better neither
works recommend trying combination together just way
scientist design experiment try understand variables
ingredients effective result want opposed just
lumping together taking said lot people want excellent sleep
badly just say okay just going take magnesium 3 8 going take
apogen going take theanine dreams Vivid waking
middle night excessively vivid dreams drop theanine many
people actually derive great benefit approach today talking
rational cost effective biologically effective approach
supplementation not sleeping well like want
explore sleeping even deeply might mental health physical health
performance well makes sense think various supplements
falling asleep versus remaining asleep include not include
systematically think one week's time taking something provided doesn't
induce negative effects right something induces negative effect recommend
ceasing taking immediately something not produce negative effects
think want try single ingredient formulation week not
varying anything else not changing anything else overall Protocols nutrition
supplementation mean impossible clamp everything perfectly week week
know don't change anything else dramatically just add supplement
given week see benefits sleep maybe add second second supplement
like rather Swap try different supplement week see
works best see combination works even better now acknowledge
just described exceedingly basic something don't think people
people either decide budget interest just improving
sleep across board don't care ingredient providing maximum
benefit simply try something decide oh well didn't work
not going try anything else supplements don't work magnesium doesn't work
um know woke middle night vivid dreams
taking shotgun approach without teasing different
variables fact overriding theme today's conversation really
learning isolate variables realm supplementation
start develop Intuition sensitivity sorts different


ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

specific time points topic happens covered now Hormone Health
important topic discuss context supplementation indeed

behavioral tools nutrition-based tools least top Contour coverage
way frames discussion supplementation appropriately
context hormone support augmentation optimization not getting
adequate calories high quality sources hormones like testosterone estrogen
will suffer one reasons women will stop periods
not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin
protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood
glucose well sex hormone binding globulin going increase dramatically
conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way
hormones insulin impact hormones free testosterone
acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases
cortisol levels cortisol levels important elevated early day
focus alertness immune function make sure cortisol levels
low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise
also relatively short meaning hour less bouts intense resistance training
times per week can also dramatically alter hormone profiles fact episode
Dr Duncan French find episode hubermanlab.com
described strenuous still brief two day week protocol using resistance
training specifically increase testosterone free testosterone growth hormone
nutrition matters exercise matters comes increasing supporting
augmenting different hormones just discussion testosterone free
testosterone estrogen also vast discussion thyroid hormone Etc
covered topics previous episodes behavioral
tools place right things avoiding wrong things
right things support hormones avoiding things diminish
hormones ways can detrimental nutrition place support
hormones makes sense turn consider supplements can support
hormones believe want get behaviors nutrition correct
start thinking supplementation hormones repeat get
nutrition behaviors correct sake hormones health
purposes start thinking supplementation hormones certainly


start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest

talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine

approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

ingredients impact enormously powerful stance going
keep costs limited also going find things work particularly poorly

00:55:55 Melatonin Caution

importantly things work particularly well toward
goals discussion supplementation sleep feel include discussion
melatonin talked melatonin numerous podcasts mine
others will say not fan melatonin couple reasons
melatonin hormone known induce sleepiness not keep us asleep
oftentimes people will take melatonin fall deeply asleep wake
trouble falling back asleep reason melatonin supplements almost always
include levels melatonin amounts melatonin far far exceed normal
biological levels so-called endogenous levels melatonin normally
produce yes true age produce less melatonin melatonin
hormone also impacts hormone systems particular reproductive hormone
access testosterone estrogen Etc not say taking melatonin
period time disrupted fertility hormone axes
possible disrupted somewhat clear melatonin can
impact not just sleep systems brain body can useful jet lag
occasional use also want voice message caution
studies exploring dosages melatonin contained various supplements
whether not listed bottle matches actually contained
formulations despite formulations coming quite reliable quote unquote
thought reliable sources found supplements contain anywhere
15 percent thought told supplements many
times melatonin listed bottle dosaging not seem
consistent often listed bottle even true within
reputable Brands real concern need highlight melatonin
perhaps something used occasionally want talk dosages
melatonin use jet lag Etc go examine.com excellent references
studies just put melatonin search function it'll

00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects



tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

adequate calories high quality sources hormones like testosterone estrogen
will suffer one reasons women will stop periods
not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin
protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood
glucose well sex hormone binding globulin going increase dramatically
conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way
hormones insulin impact hormones free testosterone
acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases
cortisol levels cortisol levels important elevated early day
focus alertness immune function make sure cortisol levels
low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise
also relatively short meaning hour less bouts intense resistance training
times per week can also dramatically alter hormone profiles fact episode
Dr Duncan French find episode hubermanlab.com
described strenuous still brief two day week protocol using resistance

start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not

talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked

supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty

things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge

kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based

supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

tell everything need know melatonin now know stance
melatonin one question often get supplementation sleep create
dependency excellent question ask think people worry even
fear relying something heavily not whatever reason
couldn't sleep experience no problem falling staying asleep
absence supplement sleep even taking supplement sleep
consistently seven days week months months maybe even years end
confess occasionally fall asleep not taken pre-sleep supplements
happen take magnesium three eight theanine epigenin also take inositol
greatly enhances sleep nights fallen asleep not
taken things slept fine said explore multiple
nights trying sleep without supplementation find sleep not good
still able fall asleep depth sleep duration sleep not
good supplementing think refreshing news least
isn't dependence supplements order able fall asleep not
sort dependence people experience things like sleeping pills
said compound compound can create placebo type effect think
need something order achieve certain effect guest podcast
time ago Dr Ali Crum professor Stanford works mindset effects
belief effects Placebo effects Placebo effects can real
sense dovetail conversation dependency meaning somebody
loves sleep supplements sleeps great one night
discover don't can't access whatever reason can
create little bit anxiety around idea oh absence not
going able sleep sort placebo effect Reverse will
suggests emotional cognitive association
taking things allows sleep well highly recommend people
explore issue dependency Placebo effects Sleep supplements
conditions nothing pressing next day don't
big presentation Etc recommend every two weeks maybe
every month take one night off completely sleep supplements leave
one sleep supplement try understand extent might established
dependency either real Placebo based sleep supplements


suggest perhaps Friday night know weekend next
day don't work perhaps don't sleep well think find
people find absence taking supplement stack
Sleep one night still gonna sleep just fine now mean
supplements not actually working normal conditions taking
night no means many things magnesiums particular can
build body brain way can beneficial probably explains
fact can still sleep miss night taking neural
circuits involved turning off thinking not thinking falling asleep
neural circuits undergo called plasticity words get better falling
staying asleep time even got better Assistance
assistance supplement combination supplements well
circuits still going function just fine even absence not taking
supplements just get back conversation little bit later talk
cognitive enhancement focus story indeed
things people can take stimulant form non-stimulant form can enhance
cognitive ability focus not mean become dependent
can't focus unless take shown multiple times
answer question dependency established taking
supplements sleep short answer no caveat Placebo effects
belief effects always going play whether not talking

context hormone support augmentation optimization not getting
adequate calories high quality sources hormones like testosterone estrogen
will suffer one reasons women will stop periods
not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin
protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood
glucose well sex hormone binding globulin going increase dramatically
conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way
hormones insulin impact hormones free testosterone
acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases
cortisol levels cortisol levels important elevated early day
focus alertness immune function make sure cortisol levels
low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise
also relatively short meaning hour less bouts intense resistance training
times per week can also dramatically alter hormone profiles fact episode
Dr Duncan French find episode hubermanlab.com
described strenuous still brief two day week protocol using resistance
training specifically increase testosterone free testosterone growth hormone
nutrition matters exercise matters comes increasing supporting
augmenting different hormones just discussion testosterone free
testosterone estrogen also vast discussion thyroid hormone Etc
covered topics previous episodes behavioral
tools place right things avoiding wrong things
right things support hormones avoiding things diminish
hormones ways can detrimental nutrition place support
hormones makes sense turn consider supplements can support

start thinking supplementation hormones repeat get
nutrition behaviors correct sake hormones health
purposes start thinking supplementation hormones certainly


start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase

take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point

talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot

caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one

kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based

supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

context hormone support augmentation optimization not getting
adequate calories high quality sources hormones like testosterone estrogen
will suffer one reasons women will stop periods
not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin
protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood
glucose well sex hormone binding globulin going increase dramatically
conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way
hormones insulin impact hormones free testosterone
acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases
cortisol levels cortisol levels important elevated early day
focus alertness immune function make sure cortisol levels
low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise
also relatively short meaning hour less bouts intense resistance training
times per week can also dramatically alter hormone profiles fact episode
Dr Duncan French find episode hubermanlab.com
described strenuous still brief two day week protocol using resistance
training specifically increase testosterone free testosterone growth hormone
nutrition matters exercise matters comes increasing supporting
augmenting different hormones just discussion testosterone free
testosterone estrogen also vast discussion thyroid hormone Etc
covered topics previous episodes behavioral

start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male

address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase

appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental

cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point

indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked

including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include

lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain

episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail

kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based

supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going

fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

specific time points topic happens covered now Hormone Health
important topic discuss context supplementation indeed

improve hormone function anytime discussing particular aspect mental
health physical health performance need start mention
behavioral tools nutrition-based tools least top Contour coverage
way frames discussion supplementation appropriately
context hormone support augmentation optimization not getting
adequate calories high quality sources hormones like testosterone estrogen
will suffer one reasons women will stop periods
not ingesting enough calories one reasons testosterone levels will drop
people not ingesting enough calories fact episode expert guest
medical doctor Peter attia described sex hormone binding globulin
protein present males females binds testosterone
hormones prevents free form active form well
insulin course going increase ingestion carbohydrates
particular insulin actually inhibits reduces sex hormone binding globulin
means intermittent fasters people ingesting


carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood
glucose well sex hormone binding globulin going increase dramatically
conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way
hormones insulin impact hormones free testosterone
acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases
cortisol levels cortisol levels important elevated early day
focus alertness immune function make sure cortisol levels
low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise
also relatively short meaning hour less bouts intense resistance training
times per week can also dramatically alter hormone profiles fact episode
Dr Duncan French find episode hubermanlab.com
described strenuous still brief two day week protocol using resistance
training specifically increase testosterone free testosterone growth hormone
nutrition matters exercise matters comes increasing supporting
augmenting different hormones just discussion testosterone free
testosterone estrogen also vast discussion thyroid hormone Etc
covered topics previous episodes behavioral
tools place right things avoiding wrong things
right things support hormones avoiding things diminish
hormones ways can detrimental nutrition place support
hormones makes sense turn consider supplements can support
hormones believe want get behaviors nutrition correct
start thinking supplementation hormones repeat get
nutrition behaviors correct sake hormones health
purposes start thinking supplementation hormones certainly


start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not

case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't

animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

carbohydrates low blood glucose perhaps taking things like
metformin berberine supplement based approach reducing blood
glucose well sex hormone binding globulin going increase dramatically
conversely eating enough calories form foods allow insulin
bit higher not excessively High hope bit higher well sex hormone
bonding globulin will go free testosterone will go discussion
hormone support augmentation include nod toward understanding
fact nutrition way nutrition impacts hormones way
hormones insulin impact hormones free testosterone
acknowledged not topic today's discussion important
remind everybody nutrition matters General hormone status also important
remember behaviors matter hormone status getting morning sunlight increases
cortisol levels cortisol levels important elevated early day
focus alertness immune function make sure cortisol levels
low night thereby levels growth hormone testosterone secreted
mainly early morning can elevated night early morning getting
morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise form cardiovascular exercise
also relatively short meaning hour less bouts intense resistance training
times per week can also dramatically alter hormone profiles fact episode
Dr Duncan French find episode hubermanlab.com
described strenuous still brief two day week protocol using resistance
training specifically increase testosterone free testosterone growth hormone
nutrition matters exercise matters comes increasing supporting
augmenting different hormones just discussion testosterone free
testosterone estrogen also vast discussion thyroid hormone Etc
covered topics previous episodes behavioral
tools place right things avoiding wrong things
right things support hormones avoiding things diminish
hormones ways can detrimental nutrition place support
hormones makes sense turn consider supplements can support
hormones believe want get behaviors nutrition correct
start thinking supplementation hormones repeat get
nutrition behaviors correct sake hormones health
purposes start thinking supplementation hormones certainly


start

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral

supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting

cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine

caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack

aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single

best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root

thinking prescription-based approaches improving hormones
elements place supplements make sense terms augmenting
hormones come two forms one broadband support multiple hormones
others supplements designed increase cases decrease
specific hormones hormone Pathways consider tandem
certain supplements things like Sheila G instance something ayurvedic
medicine may mainly uh active ingredient fulvic acid known
instance increase things like FSH follicle stimulating hormone women going
increase certain aspects egg growth hence name follicle stimulating hormone
going stimulate certain aspects fertility Pro fertile males can make
sperm production motile sperm FSH also going indirectly increase
testosterone males known increase libido males females things
like shilaji can indeed augment multiple hormones support multiple hormone
systems generally direction pro-fertility pro libido increasing estrogen
testosterone now supplements ashwagandha also fall
category affecting multiple hormones ashwagandha potent supplement
terms reducing cortisol levels also shown increase testosterone
levels probably indirectly cortisol testosterone sort exist
seesaw terms Pathways separate Pathways Pathways
interact enough cortisol lowered general testosterone tends increase
now important certain hormones like ashwagandha don't take
two weeks time high dosages want know
specifics around ashwagandha long take cycle Etc please see
episode Master stress please also see examine.com website put
ashwagandha will get description Sheila G ashwagandha
things instance like L-Carnitine supplement often discuss terms fertility
can indeed improve sperm motility quality egg quality pro
fertile compound also impacts various mitochondrial Pathways
indirect effect hormones many compounds present
available supplements purported pro-hormone support particular


testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early

depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing

high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential

high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons

food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

testosterone estrogen fertility libido description instance things
like maca root maca root can increase libido found particularly effective
women men well people suffering lower libido due
intake ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whatever reason ssris used
treat OCD used treat depression number different things maca root
can many instances effective increasing libido however
augmentation dopamine related Pathways hormone Pathways
Upstream testosterone estrogen reports Maca increases testosterone
somewhat scant little bit weak honest indirect effects
may impact testosterone Downstream put Maca alongside ashwagandha
alongside shilaji supplements impacting multiple hormone Pathways toward
increased libido

01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions

increased fertility increased testosterone estrogen likely indirect pathways
now said like provide examples supplements work
directly specific hormone Pathways aimed achieving specific goals
elevated testosterone elevated free testosterone elevated growth hormone
matter elevated thyroid hormone like talk growth hormone first
actually pretty short discussion first best way augment growth hormone
get quality deep sleep especially sleep occurs first three four hours
night growth hormone released going beneficial avoid
caloric intake two hours preceding sleep don't go bed hungry
wake hour hour half later trouble falling asleep
avoiding food intake two hours prior sleep certainly avoiding alcohol
cannabis going facilitate growth hormone release first hours sleep many
people use intermittent fasting even longer periods fasting increase growth
hormone one interesting things learned expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
medical doctor podcast indeed lengthy fast intermittent
fasting can increase growth hormone levels substantially indirect effects
genetic Pathways receptors growth hormone actually
detrimental function growth hormone avoiding food two hours prior
bedtime good idea avoid food longer just going assist even


certainly isn't going hurt terms growth hormone release extended fast
specifically purpose increasing growth hormone not really logical
look broader effects extended fast not say extended fasting not
appropriate people can certain instances intermittent fasted so-
called time restricted feeding not beneficial people can
referring effects case lack effects intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding growth hormones specifically now terms supplements
increase growth hormone supplements shown
augment pathway idea Arginine supplementation prior bedtime
can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise
really get realm prescription compounds things like
peptides like sermorelin increase igf-1 growth hormone things like growth
hormone prescription prescribed doctor course
safe start getting really significant increases growth
hormone

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel
benefited taking 12 week periods time cycling off full month
repeating best way know whether not fedojia
supplements impacting hormone levels direction want not
impacting hormone levels aspects biology ways don't
want blood test simply no better tool evaluate whether not
supplements working support hormones ways want not
causing issues except take blood test podcast inside tracker sponsor
can in-home blood tests give blood panels sources
blood tests quite good well course first episode


huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially

can Elevate levels growth hormone especially fasted literature
rather weak honest encourage go examine.com want peruse
particular studies really things increase growth hormone potently fall
outside realm supplementation include exercise look Duncan
French episode Kyle Gillette episode optimizing hormones males
particular also pertains females avoiding food two hours prior bedtime
really can boost growth hormone significantly sleep beyond otherwise

01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork

not lot supplements increase growth hormone potently now
different story start thinking talking testosterone free
testosterone luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone released pituitary
gland not far roof mouth nearby neighbor
hypothalamus collection neurons sits roof mouth talks
pituitary talks neural connections hormone-based connections
hormone called GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone released
hypothalamus pituitary stimulates release luteinizing hormone LH
travels bloodstream impact multiple tissues body mainly
ovary females testes males stimulate estrogen production


testosterone production supplements can potently increase GnRH
luteinizing hormone indirectly increase testosterone estrogen
always like remind people testosterone estrogen present males
females okay important things like libido muscle growth lot
people think oh males know high testosterone low
estrogen actually ideal actually not ideal want keep libido anything
lowers estrogen far going reduce libido don't want estrogen
high also not want low supplements can tickle pathway
actually can act bit directed hammer luteinizing hormone
pathway may also impact GnRH things like fedojia agrestis herb
talked podcast taken dosages 600 milligrams per
day many people not report elevated levels libido elevated sperm production
elevated testosterone cases elevated estrogen bunch hormones
Downstream luteinizing hormone now going fedojia agrestis responder
non-responder simply no way know except trying going
go route two important considerations first fairly
extensive literature fact fidoji agrestis can toxic testicular cells
perhaps cells taken high dosages obeying particular dosages
fedogio aggressus recommended various product labels cycling
doji Augustus can important people need cycle eight weeks two weeks
off people opt 12 weeks month off know people taken
continuously no issues want suggest caution taking fidochio
agrestis cautionary notes stay within recommended dosage ranges can
go lower certainly don't go higher think wise cycle every eight weeks
come off two weeks going back choice feel

remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing

people thinking want effect want now think important

entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us

enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include
bunch different ingredients touched idea people might
budget take one product number different products combine
ingredients say interested taking supplement
lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil
capsules liquid can beneficial number different aspects brain body
health can enhance focus cognitive ability especially true developing
brains actually extensive data laboratory University
California Santa Barbara talking mothers supplement Omega-3s
particular epas although also need get dhas leads Greater brain
weights health Offspring something will definitely explore future
episode likely expert guest work laboratory UC Santa
Barbara point somebody limited budget purchase supplements
cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential
fatty acids key get one gram EPA per day threshold
high three grams per day guest podcast Dr Rhonda Patrick
takes anywhere believe three four maybe even

01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein

grams EPA per day variety reasons including reasons
discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want
understand types protein source proteins going
bioavailable best protein synthesis recovery exercise building muscle Etc
like refer segment within episode Dr Lane Norton
talks total protein needs per day one gram per pound body weight
per day people although variation depending activity Etc
quality sourcing various proteins extremely important course
leads discussion quality type protein present
supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode
can find hubermanlab.com actually pointed interesting data
potato protein perhaps great plant-based substitute don't want
take whey-based protein fact whey-based proteins can useful
getting protein threshold sorts reasons not just muscle
building although great purposes well one
category food-based food mimic type supplements instance branched
chain amino acids instance green tea supplements huge
landscape far much us get kind um reasonable detail
want acknowledge exist key thing understand
can serve great role providing replacement meals perhaps couldn't
consumed otherwise often convenient can drink


opposed eat calories think people agree getting
significant fraction nutrition Whole Foods going useful variety
reasons particular fiber comes along bulk food tends
make us feel sated course fact lot vitamins minerals
things contained within Foods well essential fatty acids foods like
animal-based proteins not going

01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements

present not kind food mimic type powders replacements
food another point question age-related effects instance
kids taking supplements well mentioned earlier evidence
making sure kids getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can beneficial
certainly get food-based sources just look online food-based
sources omega-3 fatty acids epas see lists people choose
supplement top particular kids developing quickly
regardless whether not consuming enough epa's food parents
choose supplement top personally not fan children taking
melatonin reason melatonin already chronically elevated kids
growing body literature melatonin supplementation kids can potentially
harmful don't want create alarm among who've already taking giving
kids gave kids past think melatonin
particular approached lot caution especially kids
course issue whether not supplements
discussed whether not kids can take safely highly individual
say supplements relate hormone augmentation support
unless physician board-certified MD specifically recommends
strongly suggest avoiding intake things least puberty probably
late teens early 20s body brain still developing
hormone systems still active even though puberty may happen ages
know 11 14 even 15. puberty can long lasting event long taper tail
want cautious augmenting hormones young people
use supplementation unless physician working closely rather
ages say 22 years old 24 older don't see reason


people 50s 60s different protocols people
30s 40s except perhaps domain cognitive enhancement might
make sense might provide can done safely consult
physician might beneficial people approaching later years
consider increasing dosages variety things approaches take
cognitive enhancement age-related cognitive decline reality no
person escapes question whether not slope decline
steep shallow course opportunity raise point
made much earlier make really
important point today's discussion behaviors exercise sleep making
sure relationship light getting sufficient sunlight early day
throughout day can limiting viewing bright artificial light late
evening especially hours 10 pm 4 a.m things sort
do's don'ts course cardiovascular exercise resistance training exercise
maybe even flexibility training exercise topics covered extensively
podcast soon special series airing Dr Andy Galpin
gets lot detail protocol development can employ
needs done every age certainly past puberty order maximize cognitive
function order maximize cardiovascular function order maximize focus
every aspect really stand want enhance think
supplementation get sleep right getting relationship light
right get exercise right Quality Social connection right course
landscape nutrition talked extensively earlier
episodes really dive deep including episode say particular
episode Dr Lane Norton really took full survey landscape
nutrition everything protein needs vitamins minerals fiber microbiome deep
deep discussion lot actionable takeaways curious nutrition
particular vegan vegetarian carnivore based even
common omnivores found incredible Learning Journey
thanks Dr Lane Norton just much useful knowledge episode want
learn nutrition behavioral tools nutritional tools really going
serve primary two layers upon supplementation Protocols going
rest want emphasize supplementation protocol may zero
supplements include no supplements whatsoever perfectly


fine provided sleeping well want need able focus
work well want need able perform physically well
want need feel hormones related functions
want however people everything right
want explore can make things like sleep focus

01:55:25 Rational Supplementation Protocol

hormone function even better supplementation makes lot
sense say makes lot sense mean makes lot sense explore
rational regimented way couple big themes talked
times today's podcast like reiterate now
crucial developing rational supplementation protocol important
unless talking foundational nutritional support coverage vitamins
minerals digestive enzymes probiotics prebiotics adaptogens really
focusing single ingredient formulations foundational supplements include
things just listed off combined One supplement fine simply don't see
practical reasonable way get every one things
single ingredient formulations however want start thinking
actually practically exploring things like supplementation sleep Hormone Health
cognitive function single ingredient formulations going give
power control going make sure can find minimal effective
doses can rule things not effective may
detrimental whatever fashion not just cost Effectiveness also
arriving small kits cocktails supplements can really manage
work not dependent really feel can augment various
aspects health important really today's episode
even though coverage specific supplements functions
different domains mental physical health performance today's episode
really geared toward giving resources framework think
approach supplementation navigate sticking points pain points
supplementation get supplementation regimen without
spending excessive amount money don't finances allow lot
exploration supplements narrow effective supplements


quickly derive benefits can final point
redundant themes talked today don't think
ever really explicitly stated word supplement makes sound like
compounds something just add top compensate deficiencies
nutrition areas life many actually quite potent compounds
potent non-prescription molecules really can move needle terms
ability think clearly sleep better support hormone function
always just one element within ecosystem factors
behaviors includes do's don'ts nutrition maybe even
prescription drugs also might happen taking hoping taking less
removing completely done discussion Physicians
going real Point call supplements actually
powerful gear within larger system aimed

huberman Lab podcast Dr Kyle Gillette medical doctor expert
hormones diabetes various aspects medicine described time
stamped stand best probability getting insurance cover blood test
talk doctor getting hormone panel refer
episode blood tests going important recommend taking
adding supplement increase hormones kind decreased
hormones kind matter four eight weeks
taking particular supplement order evaluate whether not worked
whether not negative effects like avoid also wanted
remind people dosage conversation earlier just
recommended dosage fedogio agrestis say 600 milligrams per day first
not invitation take twice much expect twice positive effects not
good approach especially something like fedogiograstis can high dosages
toxic also important perhaps consider taking lower dosage seeing
affects hormones approach requires bit patience know
people thinking want effect want now think important
thinking exercise nutrition supplementation really play long game
think going work immediate end long term
ease kind supplement regimen instance taking one thing time
varying One supplement One supplement starting minimal effective dose
build protocols year several years really can beneficial can
say started exploring supplement space taking different supplements
different combination alone evaluating ones worked not work
absolutely dreadful tons stories supplement fail
just kind innocuous meaning waste money
isn't innocuous least wasn't detrimental health supplements
fortunately don't exist market anymore um think actually uh quite
dangerous feel lucky not experience even greater negative effects
supplements tremendously useful people
things like sleep hormone support focus Doja gracias good
example supplement known potent effects need approach
appropriate um say respect fact dosage ranges
works um kept pretty narrow without causing issues increase
luteinizing hormone thereby testosterone estrogen somebody


already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

already excessively high one going hard just direct
testosterone estrogen now topic today's episode not fedoji
Augustus per se highlight one potent supplements sake
hormone augmentation still fairly Broadband little specific
something like shilaji still fairly Broadband terms hitting multiple endpoint
hormones

01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido

testosterone estrogen maybe hormones well
supplements particular Tonga Ali known instance increase libido
whether not way augmenting dopamine related Pathways
testosterone Pathways still isn't clear known increase free testosterone
reducing sex hormone binding globulin Tonga Ali can beneficial men
women dosages anywhere 200 milligrams 600 milligrams per day
say scale according body size although start minimum amount find
minimal effective dose blood work going effective way
determine working not working level objective numbers
subjective experience matters know take 400 milligrams four
weeks don't notice effect might try 600 milligrams not higher
still don't see effect well doesn't appear worked
people experience dramatic effects things like fedoja Tonga Ali
case well look scientific literature find
studies report biggest effects supplement usually start population
somehow diminished back heels one particular Dimension
instance people hypogonadal not making enough testosterone free
testosterone fact levels low subclinical off range terms
charts normal well people take supplements like Tonga
Ali fedoja tend experience greater effects starting lower level
people perhaps close optimal levels achieved either age
genetics exercise nutrition combination important thing
think called floor effects sealing effects ceiling effects
instance individual already high testosterone free testosterone
take supplement increase might not see increase whereas


somebody sits middle low range stands experience much greater
increase fact one individual know took Tonga Ali admittedly
recommendation testosterone initially low number
different symptoms blood work knew low took
Tonga Ali fedoja combination decided just wanted results didn't
care thing going give results experienced big
increases testosterone not free total testosterone experienced
much 600 nanograms per deciliter increase
dramatic near tripling testosterone started off
ended don't know ever done experiment removing fidojia Tonga
find one many people just take combination
budget interested just finding works not
isolating works level single ingredients approach
recommend however think people well figure specific
ingredients going work best isolating variables way
described repeatedly throughout episode knowledge Tonga Ali not need
cycled meaning don't take periods time off note
effects Tonga Ali can take little bit longer experience perhaps blood work
done 8 12 weeks initiating Tonga Ali protocol opposed earlier
seem sort cumulative effects libido points
likelihood impact neural Pathways opposed hormone
Pathways hormone Pathways can slow general neural pathways ones
going explain slow Rising shifts kind physical mental aspect
remains stable time exact effects Tonga Ali meaning
arise brain body aren't known will provide link really
beautiful review article covers literature tonganali came fairly recently
reviewed number um MDS medical medicine related
podcasters really nice review provide link gives

01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility

survey Tonga Ali people discovering finding not
finding forth final note supplements hormone augmentation
supplementation want make brief mention something specifically related


female Health course menstrual cycle across menstrual cycle
different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain
supplements not certain supplements way impact different
hormones different effects maybe even opposite effects different phases
menstrual cycle reason believe especially important tight
control dosage individual ingredients supplement regimen
instance somebody takes Sheila Gene know many women take
Sheila G Tonga Ali instance Maca find really serves well
provides mental physical benefits want enjoy certain phases
menstrual cycle phases menstrual cycle feels like much
actually can start give negative mental physical effects well obviously
control specific ingredients going extremely important
can titrate dosage increase dosage case may cease taking
things entirely certain phases menstrual cycle not say
women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce
fluctuations thus probability certain hormones hormone Pathways will
change across menstrual cycle not eliminate altogether also key
issue fertility males females one important note even though not
episode fertility going one soon important point fertility
supplements not just Sheila G supplements
supplement protocols L-Carnitine particular injectable L-Carnitine


require prescription least US also orally ingested L-Carnitine can
improve sperm health motility egg health motility mentioned earlier
couples trying conceive important going take something
supplement directed towards sperm egg Health also consider
interfaces hormone-based compounds
prescription drugs may taking true people IVF
vitro fertilization not entire discussion will handled episode
fertility

01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine

female hormone health already episode Dr Kyle Gillette male
hormone Health optimization next category supplementation like
address supplements related cognitive enhancement focus
number useful strategies one take like divide conversation
two general categories supplements address cognitive enhancement focus
first category supplements increase energy way stimulant properties
obvious caffeine caffeine course molecule can increase
levels alertness also can increase levels focus provided dosages
appropriate range appropriate range cases going one three
milligrams per kilogram body weight taken 30 minutes kind mental
physical Endeavor entire episode caffeine can learn lots
facts caffeine best utilize caffeine indeed just give
now turns regular caffeine user can still derive cognitive
enhancing focus enhancing effects caffeine ingest caffeine every day
take two days off caffeine completely right now hear
caffeine addicts just kind cringing idea take caffeine 30
minutes prior especially important event physical mental event
really need focus able sustain Focus long periods time
even greater effect normally since people taking
caffeine kind ongoing regular way just want emphasize still Pro
cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture


sleep not going great ingesting caffeine preceding eight
ten even 12 hours actually raises another tangential still important point
going make get back supplements best cognitive
enhancer will ever take really good night's sleep sufficient duration okay
sleep going Bedrock ability focus remember things fact
sleep neural connections remodel so-called neuroplasticity actually not
trigger learning consolidate reinforce learning
number things relate cognitive enhancement focus thing
course going need sufficient levels nutrition don't want
overly hungry going hard focus want overloaded
calories volume food blood glucose high going
make sleepy reason discussing stress so-called
autonomic nervous system phrase rest digest comes play rest
digest name implies relates fact lot food gut
tends make us sleepy words hard us focus hard us
maintain cognitive attention remember things Etc bunch Behavioral
tools enhancing Focus entire episode enhancing focus touch
supplementation can find links formats hubermanlab.com
also newsletter related topic also hubermanlab.com zero cost
said particular Highlight sleep best way enhance
cognitive abilities focus anytime discussion supplements
enhancing cognitive ability focus major category supplements going
fall stimulant category going include often caffeine although
sources stimulants not going touch moment just
talk caffeine people hear caffeine think well can just drink coffee
indeed great source caffeine yerba mate caution people um
going use yerba mate whatever purpose caffeine otherwise
avoid smoked versions yerba mate carcinogenic smoked
versions carcinogenic know consume non-smoked uh varieties um
instead important thing understand caffeine can ingested
form drink energy drink coffee can also ingested pure
supplement caffeine supplements know number people
including prominent podcaster whose name won't mention drinks
herbal tea takes 100 300 milligram tablet caffeine herbal tea


case no longer herbal tea caffeinated herbal tea take caffeine
pill form tends much potent long lasting effect take
caffeine form coffee tea actually world apart terms effects
haven't experienced might something want explore
might not something want explore particular somebody
experiences anxiety panic attacks careful intake caffeine
see episode huberman law podcast caffeine
case even 100 milligrams caffeine tablet form suppose
capsule form well pure form leads much greater enhancement
alertness focus often comparable amount even twice amount
caffeine contained coffee tea now lot
things coffee tea not encouraging people become reliant
caffeine capsules caffeine tablets want increase

01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine

alertness focus caffeine potent way works category
stimulant can work terms enhancing alertness focus going things
increase adrenaline way epinephrine also called adrenaline
epinephrine thing way going touch augment
so-called adrenergic adrenaline systems things like yohimbine
different forms yohimbine like Alpha yohimbine um multiple forms
things now go examine.com explore different forms himbine
10 20 years ago yohimbine marketed primarily pro libido pro-erectile
agent turns low efficacy things certain
forms yohimbine act stimulants effective separate
claims Pathways one particular form called Alpha yohimbine sometimes goes
name raulstein spelled r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e Alpha yohimbine
used stimulant often also promote fat loss alertness say
potent somewhat um precarious supplement people experience
lot anxiety also tend take either empty
stomach combination sub caloric diets sort getting edge
things people can work not well people might actually
find effective stimulant general terms supplement based


approaches increase cognitive function focus caffeine either coffee tea form
tablet capsule form lower dosages find coffee tea
think actually reasonable way explore

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching
mostly trying individual ingredients alone combining sort
cocktail taking workout cognitive work bout
suggest explore way

01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids

going deliver best possible protocols can


determine course category supplements can support
cognitive function focus also touch General functions related
brain body Health metabolic Health mood Etc one comes
mind omega-3 fatty acids talked lot omega-3 fatty acids
available form foods instance fatty ocean fish certain plant-based
sources well certain algaes things sort touched
episodes depression done topic mainly comes around issue
fish oil fish oil capsules liquid discussion think worth early
episode talked foundational nutrition supplements include

lower budget allow taking one General categories
supplements talked earlier foundational nutrition combines everything
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics adaptogens digestive enzymes think
category supplements can greatly enhance probability offsetting
depression maybe even improve mood directly indirectly evidence
tell within scientific literature offset amount
antidepressant medication people need take also demonstrated
improve metabolic function cardiovascular function also enhance ability
focused work referring so-called omega-3 essential fatty acids
particular omega-3 form essential fatty acids now lot data showing
ingesting one three grams EPA particular form either fish oil

cannot afford foundational supplement sort talked earlier
athletic greens similar budget allow purchase
high quality Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil ingest quantity sufficient


enough get one gram EPA per day really important
look product labels often see know 1500 1600 milligrams essential

discussing now move discussing Global themes
related developing rational supplementation protocol want touch vast
category supplementation includes food-based food mimic type supplements
instance whey proteins milk proteins egg proteins plant
proteins discussion deserves entire episode want

supplement like whey protein supplement casein milk protein based
supplement discussion segmented time stamped episode

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting

aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single

different hormones present different levels follicle stimulating hormone high
so-called follicular phase right luteal phase
entire episode coming female hormones Hormone Health will cover
also covered little bit episodes testosterone estrogen
point like make now women fully expect certain

women can't just continuously take supplements throughout menstrual cycle
can find makes uncomfortable
well alter different ingredients different phases cycle speaks
critical importance single ingredient control dosage control ability cease
taking individual multiple ingredients according backdrop health
generally obviously menstrual cycle profound shift hormones thus
entire biological psychological milieu exists body course
issue birth control whether not people taking hormone-based birth
control certain forms hormone-based birth control women involve tonically
elevating means consistently elevating estrogen certainly going reduce

cognitive pro-focus effects even taken every day even multiple times per day
cautionary note don't drink caffeine late day past 2 p.m can really
start impede uh sleep night even can fall asleep night architecture

01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product
suppose take Alpha GPC NL tyrosine together already tried
separately decide worked well decide combine
people tend experience cholinergic stimulation alpha GPC
dopaminergic stimulation l-tyrosine simply l-tyrosine alone Alpha GPC alone
leads increased levels focus without kind overall feelings stimulant-based
alertness one experience caffeine indeed say course
products people combine three
things together caffeine Alpha GPC l-tyrosine not suggesting
good bad thing suggest anytime start explore


cognitive enhancing effects focus enhancing effects supplement
ask ones stimulants instance caffeine Alpha human
ones tend tap neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine
separate conceptually whereas things like Alpha yohim binding
caffeine will mostly serve role increasing levels alertness not tightening
focus things like Alpha GPC l-tyrosine tend serve role less elevation
alertness tightening focus course people often stack
take combination think important distinction people
aren't aware not tell stimulant-based approach
neuromodulator based approach better worse simply different one
another although will say think important explore separately indeed
going explore start combine single
formula individual ingredients going way go terms figuring
best anything people may find even slightest bit
caffeine even slightest spit alpha GPC l-tyrosine just places state
mind body just uncomfortable not compatible kind work
want whereas people searching regularly rely taking 300
milligrams alpha GPC turns kind doesn't work
tends send mind pathway don't like sake cognitive
work will routinely take 300 milligrams alpha GPC prior cognitive work
prior workout often combine caffeine not capsule pill form
rather form cup coffee yerba mate turns just
way example l-tyrosine something works powerfully elevate level
focus tend crash pretty hard afterward tend error away l-
tyrosine people tolerate really well actually really like rely
something else dopamine augmentation phenylethylamine little bit
short lasting arrived protocols mixing matching

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance

function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts

dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
tyrosine amino acid precursor dopamine different neuromodulator taken
loan conjunction believe separating things product

stimulant-based approaches enhancing cognitive function focus mentioned
not think probably already didn't know caffeine can enhance
alertness focus people already know acknowledge rather
contrast point supplement based approach increasing cognitive
function focus increase certain neurotransmitter Pathways not
stimulant based instance Alpha GPC essentially choline donor acts
pathways related neuromodulator acetylcholine can enhance Focus
dosages anywhere 300 600 milligrams people experience heightened levels
focus sake mental work physical work half-life alpha GPC four
six hours relatively short lasting although wouldn't necessarily want take
right bed don't recommend not stimulant tends enhance focus
augmenting acetylcholine acetylcholine Pathways specifically now create
little bit increase alertness people actually perceive subjectively
increase overall stimulation different caffeine type stimulant
instance 300 milligrams 600 milligrams alpha GPC taken alone will allow people
focused doesn't tend make people feel jittery stimulated similarly
500 milligrams thousand milligrams somewhere something like l-
