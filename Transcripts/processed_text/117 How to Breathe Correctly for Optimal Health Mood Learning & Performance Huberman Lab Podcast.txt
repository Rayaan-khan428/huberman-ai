00:09:36 Respiration, Oxygen & Carbon Dioxide

talk breathing. And, course, breathe order bring oxygen
body. also breathe remove certain things body, particular carbon
dioxide. main players today's discussion going oxygen carbon
dioxide. Now, common misconception oxygen good carbon dioxide
bad. simply not case. just take step back statement,
think this. breathe in, largely breathing air order bring
oxygen body. can just stop right say, breathe
all? can't just get oxygen world around us? Well, oxygen
can't diffuse skin deeper cells body. single cell
simple organisms can actually bring oxygen system without need
breathe. breathe order bring oxygen cells reside deep
body. particular, brain cells, metabolically active cells
body, require lot oxygen. brain cells sitting, course, brain,
encased cranial vault, skull. oxygen can't simply pass
cells. need system will deliver oxygen cells. also need
system, turns breathing respiratory system, can offload
remove gas call carbon dioxide, not carbon dioxide bad
much system not good. fact, much today's discussion will


also center around common misconception carbon dioxide something
want get rid of. don't want get rid much carbon dioxide else can't
actually get oxygen cells tissues body efficient way. need
oxygen need carbon dioxide body. also need able offload
remove carbon dioxide bring oxygen correct ratios can perform
kind mental functions physical functions want to. just dial
even further, say, key components breathing? elements
within body allow us bring oxygen tissues cells required
remove carbon dioxide body required yet keep enough carbon dioxide
around order allow oxygen thing? Well, breathing respiratory
apparatus two major components, going just briefly describe those.
this, really want highlight fact time thinking biology
physiology particular, whether not brain liver gut
microbiome, useful categorize things either mechanical mechanisms
chemical mechanisms. mean that? Well, just take analogy
hunger. mechanical mechanisms tell us eat.
instance, neurons, nerve cells gut signal stretched
nonstretched walls stomach are, full empty gut is, send
information brain make feel extent hungry not hungry.
general, stomach full especially distended, even
liquid, suppresses hunger. Whereas stomach devoid
mechanical pressure, especially number hours, tends trigger hunger
signaling via neurons brain. addition, chemical signals go
gut brain. instance, neurons gut can detect
presence amino acids proteins eat, fatty acids foods
eat, lipids, sugars, different forms carbohydrate. neurons gut
paying attention respond much amino acid, fatty acid, carbohydrate
gut sends signals brain either stimulate suppress hunger.
chemical signals passed gut brain, work parallel
mechanical signals. idea "in parallel with," again, common
theme biology, especially neuroscience. term parallel pathways refers fact
time critical bodily function, unlikely just one type
information, like just mechanical information, going used. / Almost always,
going mechanical chemical information. pick number


examples. instance, want avoid damaging skin tissues
body, essential life, well, mechanical information about,
instance, whether not something pinching ready pierce skin.
mechanical information. sent via specific neurons brain signal retraction
reflex move limb away wherever intense pressure coming.
also chemical sensing skin, presence things elicit burn
elicit itch elicit extreme cold. chemical information signaled
brain well parallel. parallel pathways common theme.
thinking respiration, a.k.a. breathing, system, also need look
mechanical system. different components nose, mouth,
lungs, et cetera, allow oxygen brought carbon dioxide removed
body not much carbon dioxide removed allow breathing work
efficiently optimally possible? also need look chemical
systems lungs, bloodstream, different cells use oxygen carbon
dioxide order understand well. can understand mechanical
chemical aspects breathing, even just top contour, well, various tools
discuss today's episode, ability calm
quickly called physiological sigh-- go detail little
bit, two deep inhales nose. first one long inhale
[INHALES DEEPLY],, second one [INHALES SHARPLY]
quick, sharp inhale maximally inflate lungs, followed full exhale
mouth lungs completely empty. big inhale nose, short inhale
nose immediately order maximally inflate lungs,
long exhale mouth lungs empty. will understand
particular pattern breathing not simply one inhale not simply inhale
nose exhale nose well optimal reducing
stress quickly. double inhale nose followed long exhale
mouth works reduce levels stress lower levels so-called
autonomic arousal fast real time. works better known
approach. not hack. actually something body specific neural
circuits do, actually performs sleep regular basis even
throughout day, can perform voluntarily. works well reduce
stress quickly not brings maximum amount oxygen
removes maximum amount carbon dioxide but, rather, optimally


balances oxygen carbon dioxide. understand mechanical chemical
aspects breathing, will understand exactly particular pattern
breathing, so-called physiological sigh, efficient way rapidly reduce
stress real time. can understand mechanical chemical aspects
breathing, will also understand people overbreathing. is,
breathing often, even breathing shallow manner. breathing
often. blowing off removing much carbon dioxide.
understand carbon dioxide critical way oxygen delivered
bloodstream tissues body, including brain, well, will make
good sense people breathing much don't actually experience
effects elevated oxygen, but, rather, putting body called
hypoxic state. not getting enough oxygen tissues body,
particular brain. true not just people obese suffer
sleep apnea, although certainly case, people have, believe
not, certain personality types. talk breathing personality type
actually breathing shown alter personality. right. Breathing can
alter personality positive ways allow anyone show various social
nonsocial endeavors life calm, focus, alertness, improve
overall health. OK, talk mechanical components breathing.
really quite simple. got nose, obviously, got mouth.

00:18:18 Breathing Mechanics

little bit later, talk incredible advantages nasal breather
time also incredible advantages using mouth breathe
inhales exhales particular types endeavors. get back
little later. meantime, two ways bring air system
nose mouth. also larynx, rigid
tissue pipe brings air nose mouth lungs. Now,
word rigid really important will soon learn lungs
basically act like pump. sort know already. two big bags
basically can fill air can squeeze air out. Now, people don't
realize lungs not just big bags air. lungs actually big
bags air inside hundreds millions little sacs called


alveoli lungs. hundreds millions little sacs, increase
surface area lungs. increasing surface area, allow
oxygen pass air lungs bloodstream didn't
sacs. allow carbon dioxide move bloodstream
sacs lungs, exhale, carbon dioxide can removed.
little sacs call alveoli lungs important part mechanical
aspect breathing get little bit later. first pass, mechanical aspects
breathing really straightforward. can breathe nose. can
mouth. goes larynx. told larynx rigid pipe.
lungs not rigid. can expand can contract like pump bring
air expel air. Keep mind lungs not muscles themselves.
need muscles can either squeeze lungs will allow lungs
expand. two general groups muscles that,
diaphragm so-called intercostal muscles. diaphragm thin muscle
sits lungs liver. inhale, provided using
called diaphragmatic breathing, diaphragm contracts. contracts,
moves down, allows space lungs inflate air. Now,
intercostal muscles muscles ribs. number people probably
don't realize this. ribs, course, bone, bones,
muscles. intercostal muscles, inhale, contract, allows
rib cage move expand bit. think, again, people probably don't
realize ribs not fixed place. can actually get closer apart
one another. inhale, rib cage actually moves up. Sometimes
shoulders will move well. intercostal muscles
contracting. Now, muscles can't move own. controlled nerves.
got nose, mouth, larynx, lungs. lungs little
alveoli them. told you, got diaphragm muscle move
lungs, intercostal muscles move ribs, can allow lungs
expand. Again, just mechanical components breathing.
muscles can't move themselves, asking, moves muscles?
really nerves control muscles. whether not contracting biceps
walking contracting quadriceps hamstrings
calf muscles, neurons, nerve cells control that. specialized nerve called
phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C, phrenic nerve, comes neck.


say comes neck, mean little neurons reside
brainstem, back brain, send little wires call axons
neck. go close heart little bit behind it. go
down, form synapses. is, form connections diaphragm.
neurons release neurotransmitters, little chemicals, diaphragm
contracts, moves down. say phrenic nerve motor nerve.
designed move muscle. However, phrenic nerve, like nerves
body, interesting not just motor nerves there, neurons control
contraction muscles. also can sense things, sensory neurons. also sends
connections diaphragm actually deep diaphragm
close liver. note said liver twice now already, going get
back later talk physical movement cramps body.
sensory neurons dive deep diaphragm. go back brain,
allow sense diaphragm is. giving information
diaphragm body. Now, time, not paying attention
this. right now, can actually try this. encourage this.
Diaphragmatic breathing is, many ways, ideal way breathe
efficient way breathe. talk mean exactly say breathing
efficiency later. diaphragm designed allow lungs expand contract
lungs, bring air body remove carbon dioxide body.
want know whether not using diaphragmatic breathing, simple.
inhale-- probably best nose,
mouth. inhale belly moves outward inhale, well, phrenic
nerve controlling diaphragm properly. exhale, belly
go just little bit. diaphragmatic breathing. Now, diaphragmatic
breathing talked context yoga. often talked way calm
on. diaphragmatic breathing just one mode brain
phrenic nerve can control muscle, diaphragm, control mechanical aspects
lungs bring air expel air. mentioned before, also
muscles ribs intercostal muscles. separate set
nerves allow muscles contract rib cage expand order
create room lungs get larger fill air rib cage
contract bit muscles relax order expel air. like go record
saying no rule diaphragmatic breathing better breathing


rib cage moves. common misconception. People say, oh, shoulders
going rib cage moving breathing, well,
not breathing right. belly goes rest body still
breathe, well, breathing correctly. know zero-- fact, zero
minus one data support statement. multiple parallel mechanisms
control mechanics lungs breathing. exerting
hard, tend use intercostal muscles rib cage moving well
diaphragm order bring lot oxygen offload lot carbon
dioxide. calmer, frankly, use diaphragmatic breathing
use rib cage type breathing order bring enough oxygen system.
no real data showing diaphragmatic breathing somehow better worse.
However, able mechanically control independently combine
use together tremendous power toward regulating mental
physical states. talk little bit later. right now, please
understand different mechanical components allow bring
oxygen system expel air thereby offload carbon dioxide
system. Again, haven't talked gas exchange carbon dioxide oxygen
happening bloodstream. talk next. basic
mechanical components pretty simple. again, just review, nose, mouth,
larynx, lungs, alveoli within lungs, two muscles, diaphragm
intercostal muscles ribs. one thing failed mention
important larynx rigid, tube rigid. reason
unlike lungs, want act sort bellow pump
can deflate inflate order move air out, larynx needs rigid
doesn't collapse bringing air out. can imagine
flimsy tube walls larynx flimsy thin, well, can
imagine breathing vigorously, shut like tube suddenly flattens
itself, not good. fact larynx rigid actually
crucial part whole system. important aspect system relates
mechanics breathing fact nose mouth different

breathe mouth [INHALES] mouth versus breathing

Totally normal. Many people think deviated septum don't
actually deviated septum. little bit later, talk repair deviated
septum without surgery actually possible many, not all, cases
immensely beneficial do. know breathing nose
little bit harder, supposed little bit harder. However, little bit
harder resistance, say, actually able draw
force mechanical aspects breathing apparatus actually bring
air lungs. can try right now. Try breathing mouth
maximally inflate lungs try mostly diaphragmatic breathing,
just sake example. words, try breathe mouth.
that, belly expand maximally inflate lungs. right now
can together can prove everyone just
deficient are. [INHALES] OK, can inflate stomach that.
now try nose, please exhale try
nose. nose, going feel resistance, notice can
inflate quite bit further. [SNIFFS] feel entire cavity, belly
maybe even lower back, fill pressure. increased resistance
actually allows draw air system. turns important.
also wipes away common misconception, somebody
challenges breathing nose, somehow avoid breathing
nose, actually, quite opposite true. can go step
say challenges breathing nose, chances
increased resistance breathing nose, provided not
completely occluded, going allow bring oxygen system.
will turn useful later explore different techniques, instance, not just
calm quickly elevate energy quickly, remove cramp
exercise, number things breathing can used can
immensely useful mental physical challenges.


00:31:23 Chemistry Breathing, Hyperventilation



now talk chemical aspects breathing. two major players
discussion oxygen, cells tissues body need, carbon
dioxide, cells tissues body need. fact, carbon dioxide plays
critical roles delivering oxygen cells. without carbon dioxide, not
going get enough oxygen cells tissues body. said, carbon
dioxide levels high, problematic. fact, one ways one can
reliably induce panic anybody breathe air contains much
carbon dioxide, much people lack so-called amygdala-- many
probably heard amygdala. brain area associated fear
threat detection. Even people completely lack amygdalas sides
brain removed epileptic seizures and,
therefore, people completely unafraid things afraid
like heights, poisonous snakes, number different things dangerous humans,
well, people breathe excess amount carbon dioxide, immediately
panic attack. tells us that, again, parallel mechanisms,
redundancy system protect much carbon dioxide
system. need enough carbon dioxide enough oxygen system
not much. way accomplished is, course, breathe air. lungs
inflate. recall little alveoli lungs, little sacs, oxygen can
actually move air little sacs little sacs
vasculature-- vasculature capillaries, veins, arteries body--
walls little alveoli exceedingly thin, tons little
capillaries go around them. amazing, right?
oxygen literally passing inside little sacs lungs inhaled
oxygen air bloodstream, oxygen gets bound
proteins blood, particular hemoglobin. hemoglobin delivers oxygen
various cells tissues body. However, oxygen can't just hop hemoglobin
cruise along hemoglobin gets to, say, brain hop off.
doesn't work way. require carbon dioxide order liberate oxygen
hemoglobin. Carbon dioxide incredible property actually able change
shape hemoglobin. Hemoglobin shaped sort cage around oxygen
molecules. cage shape, oxygen can't liberated.
got oxygen hemoglobin bound one another moving bloodstream.
tissue needs oxygen, needs carbon dioxide present open


cage. carbon dioxide does. allows cage change shape,
oxygen can liberated can delivered tissues, whether
not brain tissue muscle tissue, forth. major
chemical components breathing. aspects related
chemical components breathing, fact carbon dioxide strongly
related acidic basic body general. instance, carbon
dioxide levels go way down, blood pH goes way up. is, become
alkaline. Now, many people, word pH whole concept pH immediately
starts evoke anxiety itself. pH actually simple. want body
basically pH 7.4. regions body, particular
along gut, number importantly different order digestion work
properly. heard gut microbiome, little microbes that, provided
enough diverse enough, allow brain body function
optimally level immune system, hormone system, brain, et cetera. Well,
gut, want pH sometimes slightly acidic. acidic,
little microbiota flourish far basic. basically, want
rest body pH 7.4. carbon dioxide levels go low, pH
increases way might say, oh, well, bad, actually allows
oxygen available tissues body, least temporarily. talk
bit later. losing you, just hang almost
done whole business mechanics chemistry breathing,
can get tools revisit later clean misunderstandings
may arisen. talking carbon dioxide
key carbon dioxide problems going high low,
probably asking yourself, actually makes carbon dioxide go low?
know breathe oxygen, can pass lungs alveoli
bloodstream need carbon dioxide liberate oxygen
hemoglobin cells tissues body. know exhale--
well, actually, haven't told yet. know exhale,
carbon dioxide actually taken bloodstream back alveoli lungs.
exhale, expelled mouth nose
world. way just described that-- inhale, bring oxygen, exhale, expel
carbon dioxide-- pretty straightforward, right? Indeed, is. also tells
exhale lot lot vigorously, expel carbon dioxide.


fact, exactly way works. hyperventilate, course,
inhaling usual, also exhaling usual. you're,
course, bringing air oxygen body. also removing
carbon dioxide body normal. Carbon dioxide, ways
regulates brain state-- fact, way regulates excitability, literally
ability neurons engage electrically not-- can create states panic
anxiety, hyperventilate, feel increase anxiety,
feel increase anxiety, hyperventilate. reciprocal relationship. fact,
don't want anyone anxiety panic attacks try now.
people, probably safe long not driving something mechanical
operating machinery, is. Probably safe 25 30 deep inhales exhales.
notice breath 10, start feel tingly, probably feel
little bit alert. And, again, anxiety panic attack tendencies, please
don't this. will feel increase so-called autonomic arousal, increase
activity overall sympathetic nervous system, nothing
sympathy, everything alertness. actually deploy adrenaline
adrenals. just now. can try now, again, provided
safe place don't anxiety panic attack tendencies. just
breathe nose mouth. Remember, breathing
vigorously, exhaling vigorously
normally would. goes something like this. [INHALING, EXHALING] Now, breath 8
9 10, notice body starts heat up. due couple things,
mainly release adrenaline adrenals. already feeling little bit
lightheaded. lightheadedness actually vasculature, capillaries
veins and, extent, even arteries body particularly
brain, actually starting constrict. cutting off blood flow brain. Why?
Well, carbon dioxide actually vasodilator. Normally, exists body
keep capillaries, veins, arteries dilated allow blood pass them.
hyperventilate, sure, bringing lot oxygen, think make
alert, and, indeed, does. also expelling lot carbon dioxide
normally would. causing vasoconstriction, going
start feeling tingly periphery, fingers toes perhaps legs.
will also notice feeling alert brain might start feel
bit anxiety. hyperventilation, yes, brings oxygen, also removes


carbon dioxide. removal excess carbon dioxide puts state called
hypocapnic, hypoxia. Hypoxia reduced levels oxygen relative normal.
Hypocapnia reduced levels carbon dioxide relative normal.
reduced levels carbon dioxide largely responsible elevation energy
time feeling bit anxiety, construction
microvasculature brain body, therefore feelings kind tingly
kind urgency move. OK, now, clear need
oxygen carbon dioxide. across course episode,

00:40:35 High Altitudes, Oxygen & Breathing

will explain adjust ratios oxygen carbon dioxide depending
immediate needs plan next, whether not sleep
exercise mental work, et cetera. going further, however,
something want touch on. even though not everyone will experience this,
think enough people experience interest, now's right time touch
happens go high altitude, meaning hard
breathe get high altitudes. close sea level, getting
optimal balance oxygen air breathe. ascend altitude--
say go 6,000 feet 10,000 maybe even 11,000 feet sea level.
maybe one rare individuals climbs Denali, climb Mount
Everest, get there, notice people going wear
oxygen mask. need oxygen mask high altitudes
people high altitude skydives need oxygen way high?
Well, lot people will say, oh, not much oxygen there. air thinner.
OK, well, perhaps better way think that, remember talking
mechanical aspects breathing fact lungs don't really move
themselves, muscles, diaphragm intercostal muscles
move them? Well, lot reason lungs can fill readily air
don't much air lungs, low air pressure lungs
relative outside you. mean open mouth
[INHALES] nose breathe in, is, breathe nose mouth,
going happen air going move high pressure low pressure.
easy fill lungs. Even though need muscles move various


things around allow lungs fill, air going go high pressure low
pressure. [INHALES] listening, just took big inhale
nose. exhale, basically taking lungs state
pressure really high lungs, high pressure, like balloon full--
pressure lungs lungs full higher air outside.
pretty easy [EXHALES] expel air nose mouth. high
altitudes, air pressure lower. happens air pressure
lower outside body lungs not full air, don't really steep
gradient high pressure outside body low pressure inside lungs.
actually put lot effort breathing air lungs. really
exert lot force. get diaphragm, intercostal muscles working
really hard. might even find shoulders lifting breath
[INHALES] really generate lot force get enough air
oxygen lungs. Now, important principle understand humans,
species, really talking now humans,
inhale, active process. really need use muscles intercostals
diaphragm order inflate lungs. whole process made easier
air pressure outside body higher lungs
going fill really readily. Exhaling, least humans, passive thing.
just relax diaphragm relax intercostals let rib cage kind
fall back original position. inhaling active, exhaling passive.
happens high altitude air pressure low,
put lot energy breathing air lungs get equivalent amount
oxygen lungs bloodstream. arrive
high altitude location, first days, going feel lightheaded maybe
headache. also going buildup carbon dioxide system.
whole balance oxygen carbon dioxide going disrupted. mention
because, yes, indeed, changes atmospheric gases high
altitudes, can impact much oxygen can bring system,
tissues. heard many explanations hard breathe
feel lousy altitude. Well, just discovered one reason, don't
steep high pressure low pressure gradient outside body
inside body. converse also true. altitude days
opportunity adjust-- lot athletes, instance, will go train


altitude. hard first days weeks, get really good
training altitude. number different adaptations occur terms
amount oxygen can carried blood hemoglobin interactions
carbon dioxide hemoglobin oxygen allow oxygen
delivered tissues, that, altitude, can function just normally.
move quickly altitude-- say, training 8,000 feet 10,000
feet. hiking high level, adapted, come
sea level. Well, two five days, going feel like absolute beast.
going able essentially deliver far oxygen muscles per
breath. part, way hemoglobin oxygen

high altitude, intercostal muscles diaphragms got
trained quite bit allowed generate air volume every breath.
words, muscles got stronger, got efficient driving
phrenic nerve consciously [INHALES] really breathe lot oxygen don't
feel lightheaded, headache, et cetera. OK, little bit aside.
important aside, believe, because, A, answers question lot people ask
lot people wonder and, B, incorporates mechanical
aspects breathing chemical aspects breathing. realize little bit
unusual circumstance. now anyone asks hard breathe altitude,
know lack high pressure low pressure gradient across
body atmosphere outside you. also opportunity say
find altitude headache feeling like just
can't catch breath, spending time really consciously trying draw larger
breaths air, much might seem fatiguing short breath, will
allow adapt quickly. little bit later episode, touch
methods, including deliberate hyperventilation combined breath holds,
can allow deliver oxygen cells immediately upon arriving altitude
don't get quite much headache, disorientation, on. leaving breathing
altitude aside come back conceptual level.

00:47:16 Tool: Sleep Apnea, Nasal Breathing

00:51:50 Brain Centers & Breathing Rhythm

already talked phrenic nerve, nerve innervates diaphragm
allows lungs fill movement diaphragm.
didn't talk about, however, brain centers actually control phrenic nerve
control breathing. Knowing two brain areas
extremely important, not just understanding content episode
understanding tools discuss and, indeed, general health


relates respiration. basically two areas brain control breathing.
first called pre-Botzinger complex. don't worry name
much. Just know named bottle wine discovered
great Jack Feldman, professor neuroscience University
California, Los Angeles. one fundamental discoveries
neuroscience last hundred years brain area Jack
colleagues discovered controls aspects breathing rhythmic, is,
inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. controlled small
set neurons brainstem area, around region neck, called pre-
Botzinger complex. really owe debt gratitude Jack colleagues
discovering area involved everything breathing
asleep breathing not thinking breathing. may role--
is, function disrupted, may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.
event, pre-Botzinger complex controlling inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale patterns
breathing. brain center controlling breathing, again, phrenic nerve-
- converges goes phrenic nerve intercostal muscles--
so-called parafacial nucleus. parafacial nucleus involved patterns
breathing not inhale followed exhale, inhale followed exhale--
is, not rhythmic, one other-- but, rather, doubling
inhales doubling exhales deliberate pause breathing, inhale, pause,


exhale, pause, inhale, pause, exhale, pause, sort thing. little bit later, talk
pattern breathing called box breathing, specific useful
applications, particular adjusting anxiety. case, involves going
rhythmic breathing inhale, inhale, inhale, exhale, is, relying pre-Botzinger
complex neurons, reliance parafacial nucleus neurons box breathing, just
give away probably already obvious, inhale, hold, exhale, hold,
repeat. pattern breathing, even though rhythmic nature
inhales precede exhales precede inhales on, deliberate breath hold
inserted there. anytime taking conscious control breathing, parafacial
nucleus getting involved. Now, don't assume parafacial nucleus
way take conscious control breathing. can also take
control pre-Botzinger complex. can right now. instance,
breathing specific pattern now that, unless speaking eating, no doubt
going involve inhales followed exhales. could, instance, decide that,
yes, inhales active exhales passive. now going make
exhales active well. rather just inhale let lungs deflate,
inhale [INHALES] force air out. [EXHALES] going represent
conscious taking control pre-Botzinger complex. reason
giving mechanistic detail is, A, super important want understand
tools related breathing. B, actually pretty simple system. Even though areas
fancy names like pre-Botzinger parafacial, pretty straightforward.
one area controls rhythmic breathing-- inhale follows exhales-- area
gets involved breathing time start doubling inhales exhales.
fact, parafacial nucleus one relying speak order
make sure still get enough oxygen. also one will use
incorporate physiological sigh box breathing. And, frankly, time,
using circuits brain systems, parafacial pre-Botzinger,
parallel. Again, biology loves parallel systems, especially things critical
didn't them, die, like breathing. makes sense
two different brain structures control this. now understanding
mechanical control breathing, is, different parts within parts list
involved breathing,

00:57:23 Brain, Hyperventilation & “Over-breathing”



everything nose mouth alveoli, lungs, et cetera, muscles involved

breathing one controls nonrhythmic breathing. want repeat something
said little bit earlier well, breathing incredible represents
interface conscious subconscious control not just body, not
just lungs, breathe influences brain state. using
brain consciously control breathing, using brain control
brain. best way ever heard described beautiful, say now
classic paper Journal Physiology, published 1988 Balestrino
Somjen, final line summary intro states, "The brain, regulating
breathing, controls excitability." just remind don't
remember excitability is, excitability threshold given neuron, nerve

ways, brain becomes harder activate. excitability reduced. Now,
might think excitability great thing. always want brain excitable.
actually not case. And, fact, statement Balestrino Somjen
made led number investigations really important defining
people overbreathe, is, hyperventilate, rest, expel, is, exhale

beautiful paper asks, pattern breathing, particular,


overbreathing, change patterns activity brain? paper entitled
"Effects Voluntary Hyperventilation Cortical Sensory Responses." will provide

bringing lot oxygen, people hyperventilating.
feel really alert. And, indeed, happens. people feel alert. However,
not bringing enough carbon dioxide or, rather, proper way say
overbreathing, exhaling much, not retaining
keeping enough carbon dioxide. Well, lack carbon dioxide means
oxygen breathing can't liberated hemoglobin, can't get
brain. observe 30% 40% reduction amount oxygen
delivered brain. reduction carbon dioxide also prevents
normal patterns vasodilation, dilating, opening
capillaries, so, again, less blood flow. importantly, shown paper,
brain overall becomes hyperexcitable. starved oxygen blood
flow. neurons nonspecific way start increasing firing levels.

means hyperventilate, aren't retaining enough carbon

consequence that, brain becomes hyperexcitable. actually know
increase anxiety. become less good, less efficient detecting things
environment. not processing information well all. noise goes up,
signal goes down. Again, incredibly important set findings. also mention
hyperventilation one way that, laboratory anyway neurosurgery units
time, physicians evoke seizure seizure-prone patients. reason
works exactly explanation just gave you. Seizure excitability brain,
not enough inhibition suppression overall circuitry. get waves


storms electrical activity. Low levels carbon dioxide brain
low levels carbon dioxide blood one major triggers seizures. Now,
realize people listening not epileptic. nonetheless, brings
us back question normal healthy breathing. mentioned before,
normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath
minute passes? No. find correct pattern breathing going
involve two things. First all, nasal breathing, resistance provides
nose talked earlier, going deliver oxygen
system. going able generate air pressure fill lungs.
greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen
carbon dioxide proper ways, also taking pauses breaths.
extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.


01:09:44 Tool: Train Healthy Breathing, Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test & Box Breathing

next, like address can normal patterns breathing,
is, anyone can adjust normal patterns breathing unhealthy


unhealthy state. first thing do, course, determine whether
not already breathing unhealthy healthy way. And, again,
say healthy unhealthy, mean, overbreathing? underbreathing?
delivering appropriate ratios oxygen carbon dioxide tissues
brain body? order this, going simple test. Again, please don't
driving operating heavy machinery near water kind.
assuming not things, encourage sit down,
certainly not lie just sit down. suppose also standing.
going called carbon dioxide tolerance test. carbon dioxide
tolerance test sort back envelope measure well managing
carbon dioxide, is, well can control breathing mechanical
chemical level. simple test. going next 10
seconds speaking, just going breathe normally. Now,
throughout episode, going encourage nasal breather
whenever possible. course, instances want engage
mouth breathing. time being, continue blab next
seconds, just inhale nose, exhale nose. don't
deliberately slow breathing increase cadence breathing. However,
time, also going want find sort time measuring device, like
phone stopwatch. going ask
minutes going ask inhale nose deeply possibly
can. is, going fill lungs much can nose.
start timer measure long takes deliberately control
exhale lungs empty. going controlled exhale
nose big deep breath. time being, keep breathing kind calm,
regular cadence. can find time measuring device now, can come
back later like. say inhale, going inhale deeply can
nose, remembering diaphragm can really help get
deep inhale belly move inhale. say start,
going measure time takes complete lungs empty exhale.
fact, measure you. will one rare instances podcast
going long period silence measure something. got
stopwatch here. please prepare big inhale start inhaling now. inhale
deeply can nose. Fill lungs much can. OK? Now


start, meaning slowly control exhale nose. trying let air
slowly possible. just going call every 10 15 seconds so.
want note lungs empty. know can hold breath
lungs empty. not accurate measure. 15 seconds. important
note lungs empty trying control exhale much
possible don't arrive lungs empty time quickly. explain
quickly means. 30 seconds. OK, already reached lungs empty,
please go back breathing normally. haven't, can hang
little longer still discarding air. 45 seconds. rounding
toward minute, not quite there. probably still letting air. want
point none cardiovascular fitness level, least not
kind direct way. 60 seconds. realize will small subset
still expelling air slow lungs-- slow exhale manner
nose. OK, just back envelope carbon dioxide discard rate
need pause go back try just want time long
takes go lungs full lungs empty, again, full understanding know
can sit like beasts hold breath lungs empty.
please don't not going informative telling
now. going tell now took 20 seconds less expel
air, is, couldn't extend exhale longer 20 seconds, kind
back envelope way, can say relatively brief low carbon dioxide
tolerance. took somewhere 25 40, maybe 45 seconds expel
air, is, control exhale 45 seconds 30 seconds,
moderate level carbon dioxide tolerance. if, instance,
able go 50 seconds longer discard hit lungs empty,
fairly high degree carbon dioxide tolerance. Now, deal. low
carbon dioxide tolerance, is, 20 seconds less, going write
number three. moderate levels carbon dioxide tolerance, going
write number five. even put five six.
bracket people able discard air period 50 seconds more,
going write number 8 10. OK? Now, numbers?
talking about? get numbers,
want emphasize again, not fitness level per se. know
world class triathletes fast carbon dioxide blow-off times. is,


discard rates 20 seconds less. also point stressed,
number going small. relaxed, like just woke
long night sleep feel great, number going extended.
back envelope measure going use time decide
exercise going tell moment. exercise going tell
moment can done every day like. interesting
studies, least me, indicate exercise tell even
just twice week greatly improve efficiency breathing shift
away overbreathing rest, even not thinking
breathing rest. exercise? Well, just got number, either
low, medium, high bracket number carbon dioxide discard rate. Remember,
low category, number three. medium, five six.
long carbon dioxide discard rate, long duration carbon dioxide discard
rate, is, 8 10 number. Now going two minutes
people call box breathing. box breathing? Box breathing equal
duration inhale, hold, exhale, hold, repeat. inhale, hold, exhale, hold. Sounds
easy, right? long inhale hold, exhale hold? Well, now
know. low group carbon dioxide discard rate, inhale going
three seconds, hold will three seconds, exhale will three seconds,
repeat, three seconds. side box, will, going
three seconds long. moderate carbon dioxide discard rate category,
going inhale five six seconds, hold five six, exhale five

box breathing-- encouraging phrenic control diaphragm.
getting six liters air per minute using fewer fewer breaths
time. a, again, zero cost-- although cost little bit time-- zero cost
approach adjusting normal pattern breathing rest, huge number
positive outcomes terms ability stay relatively calm, not get

01:22:39 Tool: Breathwork & Stress Reduction; Cyclic Sighing

restore normal patterns breathing not overbreathe therefore not eliminate
much carbon dioxide exactly two tests incorporated study
laboratory collaboration associate chair psychiatry Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. David Spiegel, also guest podcast
previously. study explored box breathing. also explored forms
breathing actually compared forms deliberate breathing meditation
means explore going minimal effective doses effective
ways chronically reduce stress around clock improve mood improve
sleep. study referring just published recently. entitled "Brief
Structured Respiration Practices Enhance Mood Reduce Physiological Arousal."
will also provide link paper show note captions. study really
focused simple question, is, shortest effective
practice people can use order reduce levels stress not just


breathwork practice meditation practice around clock, 24 hours day,
including improvements sleep? excited study many
studies explored meditation or, cases, fewer studies explored
breathwork can impact different brain states bodily states. studies
explored breathwork meditation practices influenced body-brain states
around clock people not performing particular meditation
breathwork practice. reason able study really fortunate.
folks WHOOP generous enough donate bunch WHOOP straps,
allowed us measure heart rate variability, number different
physiological parameters. also got subjective reports people's mood
feelings well-being. got data sleep pinged us remote locations.
people, rather brought laboratory artificial
circumstance, laboratory, much like think laboratory realistic--
virtual reality things like that-- nothing realistic real world.
able hundred subjects real world living
real lives pinging back us data time, 24 hours day measure
different interventions asked do, breathwork practices
meditation practices, impacting physiological parameters. also
informing us regularly subjective mood, et cetera. got lot data,
can imagine. basic takeaway study twofold. First all,
discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly
lead improvements focus memory, not much reductions stress, although
lead reductions stress. found number different
breathwork practices-- explored three-- done five minutes day outperformed
meditation terms ability breathwork reduce stress around clock
compared meditation. three types breathwork explored also showed
different effects. mention three types breathwork compared


box breathing sort just learned about. compare something
called cyclic sighing, involves two inhales nose get maximally
inflated lungs followed long exhale. return moment.
repeated five minutes time session. third breathwork practice,
cyclic hyperventilation, which, name suggests, involves people inhaling
deeply nose, exhaling passively mouth, repeating
inhale nose, exhale mouth, repeating 25 cycles, one
cycle inhale exhale. equals one cycle. Repeating 25
cycles, exhaling air holding breath lungs empty 15
30 seconds, repeating inhale, exhale, cyclic hyperventilation duration
five minutes. people divided different groups, either mindfulness
meditation sat, not told control breathing specific
way. closed eyes. focused attention region just behind
forehead. One group that. group cyclic sighing. Another group box
breathing. Another group cyclic hyperventilation. sort clinical trial like
to, swapped people different groups. served
control. evaluate within individual variability. Again,
lot data paper. takeaway sake stress reduction
around clock sake improving sleep mood, effective
practice four practices examined cyclic sighing. Again, cyclic
sighing performed following way. inhale nose deeply
can. second inhale immediately afterwards try maximally inflate
lungs. fact, happens. know second inhale, even
just sharp, short inhale, extra physical vigor required generate
second inhale causes alveoli lungs, may collapsed-- and,
indeed, breaths often even just course day
especially get stressed, alveoli lungs start collapse.
damp inside-- little bit fluid. like balloon
little bit fluid middle. takes little bit physical force pop open. Now,
not literally exploding pop. reinflating air.
perform long exhale mouth lungs empty. looks exactly like
this. [INHALES DEEPLY] [INHALES SHARPLY] [EXHALES] Now, know one
single physiological sigh sort just described performed time day
conditions, whether not walk stage give talk


meeting feeling stressed, conversation
stressful, can feel stress mounting traffic number
psychological physical stressors may approaching feel
oppressing you, one physiological sigh sort just described
fastest physiologically verified way aware reduce levels stress
reintroduce calm, is, shift autonomic nervous system state
heightened levels autonomic arousal. is, sympathetic nervous system as,
called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything
so-called fight flight, although controls things, too, including positive
arousal. parasympathetic nervous system, often referred rest
digest system, although things, too, associated calming. two
things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep
inhale, short second inhale also nose, long exhale completely
lungs empty, known restore level balance sympathetic-parasympathetic
neural circuitry fastest way reintroduce calm. one physiological sigh.
study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.
translated, again, sorts positive subjective changes-- improvements
sleep, lower resting heart rate times day. important. Again, study
not just exploring happens meditation breathwork, cyclic sighing, et
cetera. exploring changes occur practice translate
changes breathing heart rate, mood, et cetera, throughout 24-hour cycle.
takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress
reduction practice now supported data translate reductions stress
around clock, data say want invest cyclic sighing, is,
double inhale nose, extended exhale mouth lungs


empty, repeat five minutes day. You, course, like,
meditation. still positive effects, meaning reduced stress, although not much
cyclic sighing. box breathing want purpose reducing
stress. practices explored reduce stress. cyclic sighing performed
five minutes day robust pervasive effect reducing stress,
improving mood, improving sleep. first message study. second
takeaway one physiological sigh-- right just one physiological sigh,
inhale deeply nose another inhale nose maximally inflate
alveoli lungs, exhale completely lungs empty go
back normal breathing, fastest way introduce level calm reduce
overall levels stress real time. important. think
days, hear lot stress reduction techniques. stress
reduction techniques explored, everything massage meditation
breathwork hot shower foot rub, will calm down. question is,
calm just practice? Great does. also translate
reduced levels stress times 24-hour cycle positive effects
well? one physiological sigh efficient way adjust ratio sympathetic
parasympathetic activation immediately bring calm. excellent
real-time control stress. thing physiological sighs not
hack. not application breathing practice something wasn't intended
for. fact, physiological sighs not discovered all. discovered

Again, doesn't tend work lot time. people, works every time.
people, doesn't work all. However, technique can reliably
eliminate hiccups. technique takes advantage hypercontracting

focused breathing techniques emphasize exhale,

01:51:17 Tool: Stress Management & Cyclic Hyperventilation, “Wim Hof Method”

whether not carbon dioxide tolerance test, whether not cyclic sighing

haven't talked much cyclic hyperventilation. Cyclic hyperventilation,

title paper "Nasal Respiration Entrains Human Limbic Oscillations
Modulates Cognitive Function." paper followed earlier paper
showed people breathe nose, recognition
discrimination different odors far greater breathe
mouth. Now, result interesting, also sort duh smell
things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal
inhalations versus nasal exhalations versus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.
basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal
noise talked earlier, recall, ability brain detect things
environment, increased inhalations. earlier study focused
smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate
variables. paper, one just mentioned, "Nasal Respiration Entrains
Human Limbic Oscillations Modulates Cognitive Function," not look
detection odors. Rather, looked things like reaction time fear. basically,
found reaction time greatly reduced people inhaling.
people look fearful stimuli. looked reaction time fearful stimuli,

basic takeaway people inhaling, is, drawing air

people inhaling, ability detect novel stimuli, things unexpected

Now, one caveat think important know number

might come surprise. now, basically talking inhalation

don't want overbreathe kick much carbon dioxide. Well, course
exhalation great things. fact, somebody played baseball

called volitional, voluntary movements greatly enhanced
exhale, not inhale. Now, said, haven't yet really talked mouth
versus nasal breathing.

really quite simple. got nose, obviously, got mouth.

00:18:18 Breathing Mechanics

little bit later, talk incredible advantages nasal breather
time also incredible advantages using mouth breathe
inhales exhales particular types endeavors. get back
little later. meantime, two ways bring air system
nose mouth. also larynx, rigid
tissue pipe brings air nose mouth lungs. Now,
word rigid really important will soon learn lungs
basically act like pump. sort know already. two big bags
basically can fill air can squeeze air out. Now, people don't
realize lungs not just big bags air. lungs actually big
bags air inside hundreds millions little sacs called


alveoli lungs. hundreds millions little sacs, increase
surface area lungs. increasing surface area, allow
oxygen pass air lungs bloodstream didn't
sacs. allow carbon dioxide move bloodstream
sacs lungs, exhale, carbon dioxide can removed.
little sacs call alveoli lungs important part mechanical
aspect breathing get little bit later. first pass, mechanical aspects
breathing really straightforward. can breathe nose. can
mouth. goes larynx. told larynx rigid pipe.
lungs not rigid. can expand can contract like pump bring
air expel air. Keep mind lungs not muscles themselves.
need muscles can either squeeze lungs will allow lungs
expand. two general groups muscles that,
diaphragm so-called intercostal muscles. diaphragm thin muscle
sits lungs liver. inhale, provided using
called diaphragmatic breathing, diaphragm contracts. contracts,
moves down, allows space lungs inflate air. Now,
intercostal muscles muscles ribs. number people probably
don't realize this. ribs, course, bone, bones,
muscles. intercostal muscles, inhale, contract, allows
rib cage move expand bit. think, again, people probably don't
realize ribs not fixed place. can actually get closer apart
one another. inhale, rib cage actually moves up. Sometimes
shoulders will move well. intercostal muscles
contracting. Now, muscles can't move own. controlled nerves.
got nose, mouth, larynx, lungs. lungs little
alveoli them. told you, got diaphragm muscle move
lungs, intercostal muscles move ribs, can allow lungs
expand. Again, just mechanical components breathing.
muscles can't move themselves, asking, moves muscles?
really nerves control muscles. whether not contracting biceps
walking contracting quadriceps hamstrings
calf muscles, neurons, nerve cells control that. specialized nerve called
phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C, phrenic nerve, comes neck.


say comes neck, mean little neurons reside
brainstem, back brain, send little wires call axons
neck. go close heart little bit behind it. go
down, form synapses. is, form connections diaphragm.
neurons release neurotransmitters, little chemicals, diaphragm
contracts, moves down. say phrenic nerve motor nerve.
designed move muscle. However, phrenic nerve, like nerves
body, interesting not just motor nerves there, neurons control
contraction muscles. also can sense things, sensory neurons. also sends
connections diaphragm actually deep diaphragm
close liver. note said liver twice now already, going get
back later talk physical movement cramps body.
sensory neurons dive deep diaphragm. go back brain,
allow sense diaphragm is. giving information
diaphragm body. Now, time, not paying attention
this. right now, can actually try this. encourage this.
Diaphragmatic breathing is, many ways, ideal way breathe
efficient way breathe. talk mean exactly say breathing
efficiency later. diaphragm designed allow lungs expand contract
lungs, bring air body remove carbon dioxide body.
want know whether not using diaphragmatic breathing, simple.
inhale-- probably best nose,
mouth. inhale belly moves outward inhale, well, phrenic
nerve controlling diaphragm properly. exhale, belly
go just little bit. diaphragmatic breathing. Now, diaphragmatic
breathing talked context yoga. often talked way calm
on. diaphragmatic breathing just one mode brain
phrenic nerve can control muscle, diaphragm, control mechanical aspects
lungs bring air expel air. mentioned before, also
muscles ribs intercostal muscles. separate set
nerves allow muscles contract rib cage expand order
create room lungs get larger fill air rib cage
contract bit muscles relax order expel air. like go record
saying no rule diaphragmatic breathing better breathing


rib cage moves. common misconception. People say, oh, shoulders
going rib cage moving breathing, well,
not breathing right. belly goes rest body still
breathe, well, breathing correctly. know zero-- fact, zero
minus one data support statement. multiple parallel mechanisms
control mechanics lungs breathing. exerting
hard, tend use intercostal muscles rib cage moving well
diaphragm order bring lot oxygen offload lot carbon

use rib cage type breathing order bring enough oxygen system.
no real data showing diaphragmatic breathing somehow better worse.
However, able mechanically control independently combine
use together tremendous power toward regulating mental
physical states. talk little bit later. right now, please
understand different mechanical components allow bring
oxygen system expel air thereby offload carbon dioxide
system. Again, haven't talked gas exchange carbon dioxide oxygen
happening bloodstream. talk next. basic
mechanical components pretty simple. again, just review, nose, mouth,
larynx, lungs, alveoli within lungs, two muscles, diaphragm

now try nose, please exhale try

also wipes away common misconception, somebody
challenges breathing nose, somehow avoid breathing

00:31:23 Chemistry Breathing, Hyperventilation



now talk chemical aspects breathing. two major players
discussion oxygen, cells tissues body need, carbon
dioxide, cells tissues body need. fact, carbon dioxide plays
critical roles delivering oxygen cells. without carbon dioxide, not
going get enough oxygen cells tissues body. said, carbon
dioxide levels high, problematic. fact, one ways one can
reliably induce panic anybody breathe air contains much
carbon dioxide, much people lack so-called amygdala-- many
probably heard amygdala. brain area associated fear
threat detection. Even people completely lack amygdalas sides
brain removed epileptic seizures and,
therefore, people completely unafraid things afraid
like heights, poisonous snakes, number different things dangerous humans,
well, people breathe excess amount carbon dioxide, immediately
panic attack. tells us that, again, parallel mechanisms,
redundancy system protect much carbon dioxide
system. need enough carbon dioxide enough oxygen system
not much. way accomplished is, course, breathe air. lungs
inflate. recall little alveoli lungs, little sacs, oxygen can
actually move air little sacs little sacs
vasculature-- vasculature capillaries, veins, arteries body--
walls little alveoli exceedingly thin, tons little
capillaries go around them. amazing, right?
oxygen literally passing inside little sacs lungs inhaled

various cells tissues body. However, oxygen can't just hop hemoglobin
cruise along hemoglobin gets to, say, brain hop off.
doesn't work way. require carbon dioxide order liberate oxygen
hemoglobin. Carbon dioxide incredible property actually able change
shape hemoglobin. Hemoglobin shaped sort cage around oxygen

got oxygen hemoglobin bound one another moving bloodstream.
tissue needs oxygen, needs carbon dioxide present open


cage. carbon dioxide does. allows cage change shape,
oxygen can liberated can delivered tissues, whether
not brain tissue muscle tissue, forth. major
chemical components breathing. aspects related
chemical components breathing, fact carbon dioxide strongly
related acidic basic body general. instance, carbon
dioxide levels go way down, blood pH goes way up. is, become
alkaline. Now, many people, word pH whole concept pH immediately
starts evoke anxiety itself. pH actually simple. want body
basically pH 7.4. regions body, particular
along gut, number importantly different order digestion work
properly. heard gut microbiome, little microbes that, provided
enough diverse enough, allow brain body function
optimally level immune system, hormone system, brain, et cetera. Well,
gut, want pH sometimes slightly acidic. acidic,
little microbiota flourish far basic. basically, want
rest body pH 7.4. carbon dioxide levels go low, pH
increases way might say, oh, well, bad, actually allows
oxygen available tissues body, least temporarily. talk
bit later. losing you, just hang almost
done whole business mechanics chemistry breathing,
can get tools revisit later clean misunderstandings
may arisen. talking carbon dioxide
key carbon dioxide problems going high low,
probably asking yourself, actually makes carbon dioxide go low?
know breathe oxygen, can pass lungs alveoli
bloodstream need carbon dioxide liberate oxygen
hemoglobin cells tissues body. know exhale--
well, actually, haven't told yet. know exhale,
carbon dioxide actually taken bloodstream back alveoli lungs.
exhale, expelled mouth nose
world. way just described that-- inhale, bring oxygen, exhale, expel
carbon dioxide-- pretty straightforward, right? Indeed, is. also tells
exhale lot lot vigorously, expel carbon dioxide.


fact, exactly way works. hyperventilate, course,
inhaling usual, also exhaling usual. you're,
course, bringing air oxygen body. also removing
carbon dioxide body normal. Carbon dioxide, ways
regulates brain state-- fact, way regulates excitability, literally
ability neurons engage electrically not-- can create states panic

don't want anyone anxiety panic attacks try now.
people, probably safe long not driving something mechanical

don't this. will feel increase so-called autonomic arousal, increase

sympathy, everything alertness. actually deploy adrenaline
adrenals. just now. can try now, again, provided
safe place don't anxiety panic attack tendencies. just
breathe nose mouth. Remember, breathing
vigorously, exhaling vigorously
normally would. goes something like this. [INHALING, EXHALING] Now, breath 8
9 10, notice body starts heat up. due couple things,
mainly release adrenaline adrenals. already feeling little bit
lightheaded. lightheadedness actually vasculature, capillaries
veins and, extent, even arteries body particularly
brain, actually starting constrict. cutting off blood flow brain. Why?
Well, carbon dioxide actually vasodilator. Normally, exists body
keep capillaries, veins, arteries dilated allow blood pass them.
hyperventilate, sure, bringing lot oxygen, think make
alert, and, indeed, does. also expelling lot carbon dioxide
normally would. causing vasoconstriction, going
start feeling tingly periphery, fingers toes perhaps legs.
will also notice feeling alert brain might start feel
bit anxiety. hyperventilation, yes, brings oxygen, also removes


carbon dioxide. removal excess carbon dioxide puts state called
hypocapnic, hypoxia. Hypoxia reduced levels oxygen relative normal.
Hypocapnia reduced levels carbon dioxide relative normal.
reduced levels carbon dioxide largely responsible elevation energy
time feeling bit anxiety, construction
microvasculature brain body, therefore feelings kind tingly
kind urgency move. OK, now, clear need
oxygen carbon dioxide. across course episode,

00:40:35 High Altitudes, Oxygen & Breathing

will explain adjust ratios oxygen carbon dioxide depending
immediate needs plan next, whether not sleep
exercise mental work, et cetera. going further, however,
something want touch on. even though not everyone will experience this,
think enough people experience interest, now's right time touch
happens go high altitude, meaning hard
breathe get high altitudes. close sea level, getting
optimal balance oxygen air breathe. ascend altitude--
say go 6,000 feet 10,000 maybe even 11,000 feet sea level.
maybe one rare individuals climbs Denali, climb Mount
Everest, get there, notice people going wear
oxygen mask. need oxygen mask high altitudes
people high altitude skydives need oxygen way high?
Well, lot people will say, oh, not much oxygen there. air thinner.
OK, well, perhaps better way think that, remember talking
mechanical aspects breathing fact lungs don't really move
themselves, muscles, diaphragm intercostal muscles
move them? Well, lot reason lungs can fill readily air
don't much air lungs, low air pressure lungs
relative outside you. mean open mouth
[INHALES] nose breathe in, is, breathe nose mouth,
going happen air going move high pressure low pressure.
easy fill lungs. Even though need muscles move various


things around allow lungs fill, air going go high pressure low
pressure. [INHALES] listening, just took big inhale
nose. exhale, basically taking lungs state
pressure really high lungs, high pressure, like balloon full--
pressure lungs lungs full higher air outside.
pretty easy [EXHALES] expel air nose mouth. high
altitudes, air pressure lower. happens air pressure
lower outside body lungs not full air, don't really steep
gradient high pressure outside body low pressure inside lungs.
actually put lot effort breathing air lungs. really
exert lot force. get diaphragm, intercostal muscles working
really hard. might even find shoulders lifting breath
[INHALES] really generate lot force get enough air
oxygen lungs. Now, important principle understand humans,
species, really talking now humans,
inhale, active process. really need use muscles intercostals
diaphragm order inflate lungs. whole process made easier
air pressure outside body higher lungs
going fill really readily. Exhaling, least humans, passive thing.
just relax diaphragm relax intercostals let rib cage kind
fall back original position. inhaling active, exhaling passive.
happens high altitude air pressure low,
put lot energy breathing air lungs get equivalent amount
oxygen lungs bloodstream. arrive
high altitude location, first days, going feel lightheaded maybe
headache. also going buildup carbon dioxide system.
whole balance oxygen carbon dioxide going disrupted. mention
because, yes, indeed, changes atmospheric gases high
altitudes, can impact much oxygen can bring system,

00:51:50 Brain Centers & Breathing Rhythm

already talked phrenic nerve, nerve innervates diaphragm
allows lungs fill movement diaphragm.
didn't talk about, however, brain centers actually control phrenic nerve
control breathing. Knowing two brain areas
extremely important, not just understanding content episode
understanding tools discuss and, indeed, general health


relates respiration. basically two areas brain control breathing.
first called pre-Botzinger complex. don't worry name
much. Just know named bottle wine discovered
great Jack Feldman, professor neuroscience University
California, Los Angeles. one fundamental discoveries
neuroscience last hundred years brain area Jack
colleagues discovered controls aspects breathing rhythmic, is,
inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. controlled small
set neurons brainstem area, around region neck, called pre-
Botzinger complex. really owe debt gratitude Jack colleagues
discovering area involved everything breathing
asleep breathing not thinking breathing. may role--
is, function disrupted, may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.
event, pre-Botzinger complex controlling inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale patterns
breathing. brain center controlling breathing, again, phrenic nerve-
- converges goes phrenic nerve intercostal muscles--
so-called parafacial nucleus. parafacial nucleus involved patterns
breathing not inhale followed exhale, inhale followed exhale--
is, not rhythmic, one other-- but, rather, doubling
inhales doubling exhales deliberate pause breathing, inhale, pause,


exhale, pause, inhale, pause, exhale, pause, sort thing. little bit later, talk
pattern breathing called box breathing, specific useful
applications, particular adjusting anxiety. case, involves going

inhales precede exhales precede inhales on, deliberate breath hold
inserted there. anytime taking conscious control breathing, parafacial
nucleus getting involved. Now, don't assume parafacial nucleus
way take conscious control breathing. can also take
control pre-Botzinger complex. can right now. instance,
breathing specific pattern now that, unless speaking eating, no doubt
going involve inhales followed exhales. could, instance, decide that,
yes, inhales active exhales passive. now going make
exhales active well. rather just inhale let lungs deflate,
inhale [INHALES] force air out. [EXHALES] going represent
conscious taking control pre-Botzinger complex. reason
giving mechanistic detail is, A, super important want understand
tools related breathing. B, actually pretty simple system. Even though areas
fancy names like pre-Botzinger parafacial, pretty straightforward.
one area controls rhythmic breathing-- inhale follows exhales-- area
gets involved breathing time start doubling inhales exhales.
fact, parafacial nucleus one relying speak order
make sure still get enough oxygen. also one will use
incorporate physiological sigh box breathing. And, frankly, time,
using circuits brain systems, parafacial pre-Botzinger,

two different brain structures control this. now understanding
mechanical control breathing, is, different parts within parts list

feel really alert. And, indeed, happens. people feel alert. However,
not bringing enough carbon dioxide or, rather, proper way say
overbreathing, exhaling much, not retaining
keeping enough carbon dioxide. Well, lack carbon dioxide means
oxygen breathing can't liberated hemoglobin, can't get

us back question normal healthy breathing. mentioned before,
normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath

involve two things. First all, nasal breathing, resistance provides
nose talked earlier, going deliver oxygen
system. going able generate air pressure fill lungs.
greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen
carbon dioxide proper ways, also taking pauses breaths.
extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.

discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,

research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly

called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything
so-called fight flight, although controls things, too, including positive
arousal. parasympathetic nervous system, often referred rest

things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep
inhale, short second inhale also nose, long exhale completely
lungs empty, known restore level balance sympathetic-parasympathetic
neural circuitry fastest way reintroduce calm. one physiological sigh.
study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.

takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress
reduction practice now supported data translate reductions stress

01:39:16 Breathing & Heart Rate Variability

organs neighborhood, talk relationship
breathing heart rate. incredibly important topic, much
perhaps brought beginning episode. nonetheless,
now know diaphragm does. inhale, diaphragm moves down.
right. contract diaphragm, moves down. creates space
lungs inhale. exhale, diaphragm moves up. Well, inhale
diaphragm moves down, happens space created


thoracic cavity particularly also breathing deeply using
intercostal muscles expand ribs. consequence, heart actually gets
little bit bigger. temporary enlargement heart. real enlargement.
consequence, whatever blood heart now larger volume
heart got bigger. consequence, blood moving slowly
larger volume short period time. nonetheless, moving slowly.
nervous system detects sends neural signal heart speed heart

exhale. exhale, diaphragm moves up. rib cage tends move
inward bit. compact heart. reduce volume heart overall.
reduce volume heart overall, blood flow heart
accelerates smaller volume. given unit blood going move
quickly small volume. nervous system detects sends
signal slow heart down. just inhales speed heart up, exhales slow
heart rate down. Now, course, even though can double inhales even
triple inhales, sooner later, inhale, going exhale.
converse also true, course. mean terms controlling
heart rate? Well, say going blood draw, going stage
stressed. Well, encourage physiological sigh, maybe two
physiological sighs bring level calm level stress down.
Nonetheless, reason want quickly reduce heart rate
accelerate heart rate sake physical work output calm
additionally, not just use physiological sigh, well, can take advantage
relationship inhales exhales controlling heart rate. want increase
heart rate, can simply inhale longer vigorously relative
exhales. want decrease heart rate, well, going make
exhales longer and/or vigorous inhales. fact, process,
called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, basis call heart rate variability.
Heart rate variability involves vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve,
parasympathetic nerve associated calming aspect autonomic
nervous system, slowing heart rate extending exhales. really
forms basis breathing practices. look breathing practices,

heart rate breathing intimate discussion one another,
always forever inhales increase heart rate, exhales decrease it. Now,
feature, physicians call respiratory sinus arrhythmia, sometimes hear
often nowadays heart rate variability, something people sport
known long time. why, instance, marksmen will exhale
just prior taking shot. particularly true people compete biathlon,
cross country ski. heart rate up, up, up, up, up. get

title paper "Nasal Respiration Entrains Human Limbic Oscillations

showed people breathe nose, recognition
discrimination different odors far greater breathe
mouth. Now, result interesting, also sort duh smell
things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal
inhalations versus nasal exhalations versus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.
basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal
noise talked earlier, recall, ability brain detect things
environment, increased inhalations. earlier study focused
smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate
variables. paper, one just mentioned, "Nasal Respiration Entrains
Human Limbic Oscillations Modulates Cognitive Function," not look
detection odors. Rather, looked things like reaction time fear. basically,
found reaction time greatly reduced people inhaling.
people look fearful stimuli. looked reaction time fearful stimuli,

called volitional, voluntary movements greatly enhanced
exhale, not inhale. Now, said, haven't yet really talked mouth
versus nasal breathing.

little bit later, talk incredible advantages nasal breather
time also incredible advantages using mouth breathe
inhales exhales particular types endeavors. get back
little later. meantime, two ways bring air system
nose mouth. also larynx, rigid
tissue pipe brings air nose mouth lungs. Now,
word rigid really important will soon learn lungs
basically act like pump. sort know already. two big bags
basically can fill air can squeeze air out. Now, people don't
realize lungs not just big bags air. lungs actually big
bags air inside hundreds millions little sacs called


alveoli lungs. hundreds millions little sacs, increase
surface area lungs. increasing surface area, allow
oxygen pass air lungs bloodstream didn't
sacs. allow carbon dioxide move bloodstream
sacs lungs, exhale, carbon dioxide can removed.
little sacs call alveoli lungs important part mechanical
aspect breathing get little bit later. first pass, mechanical aspects
breathing really straightforward. can breathe nose. can
mouth. goes larynx. told larynx rigid pipe.
lungs not rigid. can expand can contract like pump bring
air expel air. Keep mind lungs not muscles themselves.
need muscles can either squeeze lungs will allow lungs
expand. two general groups muscles that,
diaphragm so-called intercostal muscles. diaphragm thin muscle
sits lungs liver. inhale, provided using
called diaphragmatic breathing, diaphragm contracts. contracts,
moves down, allows space lungs inflate air. Now,
intercostal muscles muscles ribs. number people probably
don't realize this. ribs, course, bone, bones,
muscles. intercostal muscles, inhale, contract, allows
rib cage move expand bit. think, again, people probably don't
realize ribs not fixed place. can actually get closer apart
one another. inhale, rib cage actually moves up. Sometimes
shoulders will move well. intercostal muscles
contracting. Now, muscles can't move own. controlled nerves.
got nose, mouth, larynx, lungs. lungs little
alveoli them. told you, got diaphragm muscle move
lungs, intercostal muscles move ribs, can allow lungs
expand. Again, just mechanical components breathing.
muscles can't move themselves, asking, moves muscles?
really nerves control muscles. whether not contracting biceps
walking contracting quadriceps hamstrings
calf muscles, neurons, nerve cells control that. specialized nerve called
phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C, phrenic nerve, comes neck.


say comes neck, mean little neurons reside
brainstem, back brain, send little wires call axons
neck. go close heart little bit behind it. go
down, form synapses. is, form connections diaphragm.
neurons release neurotransmitters, little chemicals, diaphragm
contracts, moves down. say phrenic nerve motor nerve.
designed move muscle. However, phrenic nerve, like nerves
body, interesting not just motor nerves there, neurons control
contraction muscles. also can sense things, sensory neurons. also sends
connections diaphragm actually deep diaphragm
close liver. note said liver twice now already, going get
back later talk physical movement cramps body.
sensory neurons dive deep diaphragm. go back brain,
allow sense diaphragm is. giving information
diaphragm body. Now, time, not paying attention
this. right now, can actually try this. encourage this.
Diaphragmatic breathing is, many ways, ideal way breathe
efficient way breathe. talk mean exactly say breathing
efficiency later. diaphragm designed allow lungs expand contract
lungs, bring air body remove carbon dioxide body.
want know whether not using diaphragmatic breathing, simple.
inhale-- probably best nose,

go just little bit. diaphragmatic breathing. Now, diaphragmatic
breathing talked context yoga. often talked way calm
on. diaphragmatic breathing just one mode brain
phrenic nerve can control muscle, diaphragm, control mechanical aspects
lungs bring air expel air. mentioned before, also
muscles ribs intercostal muscles. separate set
nerves allow muscles contract rib cage expand order
create room lungs get larger fill air rib cage
contract bit muscles relax order expel air. like go record

use rib cage type breathing order bring enough oxygen system.
no real data showing diaphragmatic breathing somehow better worse.
However, able mechanically control independently combine

00:31:23 Chemistry Breathing, Hyperventilation



now talk chemical aspects breathing. two major players
discussion oxygen, cells tissues body need, carbon
dioxide, cells tissues body need. fact, carbon dioxide plays
critical roles delivering oxygen cells. without carbon dioxide, not
going get enough oxygen cells tissues body. said, carbon
dioxide levels high, problematic. fact, one ways one can
reliably induce panic anybody breathe air contains much
carbon dioxide, much people lack so-called amygdala-- many
probably heard amygdala. brain area associated fear
threat detection. Even people completely lack amygdalas sides
brain removed epileptic seizures and,
therefore, people completely unafraid things afraid
like heights, poisonous snakes, number different things dangerous humans,
well, people breathe excess amount carbon dioxide, immediately
panic attack. tells us that, again, parallel mechanisms,
redundancy system protect much carbon dioxide
system. need enough carbon dioxide enough oxygen system
not much. way accomplished is, course, breathe air. lungs
inflate. recall little alveoli lungs, little sacs, oxygen can
actually move air little sacs little sacs
vasculature-- vasculature capillaries, veins, arteries body--
walls little alveoli exceedingly thin, tons little
capillaries go around them. amazing, right?
oxygen literally passing inside little sacs lungs inhaled
oxygen air bloodstream, oxygen gets bound
proteins blood, particular hemoglobin. hemoglobin delivers oxygen
various cells tissues body. However, oxygen can't just hop hemoglobin
cruise along hemoglobin gets to, say, brain hop off.
doesn't work way. require carbon dioxide order liberate oxygen
hemoglobin. Carbon dioxide incredible property actually able change
shape hemoglobin. Hemoglobin shaped sort cage around oxygen
molecules. cage shape, oxygen can't liberated.
got oxygen hemoglobin bound one another moving bloodstream.
tissue needs oxygen, needs carbon dioxide present open


cage. carbon dioxide does. allows cage change shape,
oxygen can liberated can delivered tissues, whether
not brain tissue muscle tissue, forth. major
chemical components breathing. aspects related
chemical components breathing, fact carbon dioxide strongly
related acidic basic body general. instance, carbon
dioxide levels go way down, blood pH goes way up. is, become
alkaline. Now, many people, word pH whole concept pH immediately
starts evoke anxiety itself. pH actually simple. want body
basically pH 7.4. regions body, particular
along gut, number importantly different order digestion work
properly. heard gut microbiome, little microbes that, provided
enough diverse enough, allow brain body function
optimally level immune system, hormone system, brain, et cetera. Well,
gut, want pH sometimes slightly acidic. acidic,
little microbiota flourish far basic. basically, want
rest body pH 7.4. carbon dioxide levels go low, pH
increases way might say, oh, well, bad, actually allows
oxygen available tissues body, least temporarily. talk
bit later. losing you, just hang almost
done whole business mechanics chemistry breathing,
can get tools revisit later clean misunderstandings
may arisen. talking carbon dioxide
key carbon dioxide problems going high low,
probably asking yourself, actually makes carbon dioxide go low?
know breathe oxygen, can pass lungs alveoli
bloodstream need carbon dioxide liberate oxygen
hemoglobin cells tissues body. know exhale--
well, actually, haven't told yet. know exhale,
carbon dioxide actually taken bloodstream back alveoli lungs.
exhale, expelled mouth nose
world. way just described that-- inhale, bring oxygen, exhale, expel
carbon dioxide-- pretty straightforward, right? Indeed, is. also tells
exhale lot lot vigorously, expel carbon dioxide.


fact, exactly way works. hyperventilate, course,
inhaling usual, also exhaling usual. you're,
course, bringing air oxygen body. also removing
carbon dioxide body normal. Carbon dioxide, ways
regulates brain state-- fact, way regulates excitability, literally
ability neurons engage electrically not-- can create states panic
anxiety, hyperventilate, feel increase anxiety,
feel increase anxiety, hyperventilate. reciprocal relationship. fact,
don't want anyone anxiety panic attacks try now.
people, probably safe long not driving something mechanical
operating machinery, is. Probably safe 25 30 deep inhales exhales.
notice breath 10, start feel tingly, probably feel
little bit alert. And, again, anxiety panic attack tendencies, please
don't this. will feel increase so-called autonomic arousal, increase
activity overall sympathetic nervous system, nothing
sympathy, everything alertness. actually deploy adrenaline
adrenals. just now. can try now, again, provided
safe place don't anxiety panic attack tendencies. just
breathe nose mouth. Remember, breathing
vigorously, exhaling vigorously
normally would. goes something like this. [INHALING, EXHALING] Now, breath 8
9 10, notice body starts heat up. due couple things,
mainly release adrenaline adrenals. already feeling little bit
lightheaded. lightheadedness actually vasculature, capillaries
veins and, extent, even arteries body particularly
brain, actually starting constrict. cutting off blood flow brain. Why?
Well, carbon dioxide actually vasodilator. Normally, exists body
keep capillaries, veins, arteries dilated allow blood pass them.
hyperventilate, sure, bringing lot oxygen, think make
alert, and, indeed, does. also expelling lot carbon dioxide
normally would. causing vasoconstriction, going
start feeling tingly periphery, fingers toes perhaps legs.
will also notice feeling alert brain might start feel
bit anxiety. hyperventilation, yes, brings oxygen, also removes


carbon dioxide. removal excess carbon dioxide puts state called
hypocapnic, hypoxia. Hypoxia reduced levels oxygen relative normal.
Hypocapnia reduced levels carbon dioxide relative normal.
reduced levels carbon dioxide largely responsible elevation energy
time feeling bit anxiety, construction
microvasculature brain body, therefore feelings kind tingly
kind urgency move. OK, now, clear need
oxygen carbon dioxide. across course episode,

00:40:35 High Altitudes, Oxygen & Breathing

will explain adjust ratios oxygen carbon dioxide depending
immediate needs plan next, whether not sleep
exercise mental work, et cetera. going further, however,
something want touch on. even though not everyone will experience this,
think enough people experience interest, now's right time touch
happens go high altitude, meaning hard
breathe get high altitudes. close sea level, getting
optimal balance oxygen air breathe. ascend altitude--
say go 6,000 feet 10,000 maybe even 11,000 feet sea level.
maybe one rare individuals climbs Denali, climb Mount
Everest, get there, notice people going wear
oxygen mask. need oxygen mask high altitudes
people high altitude skydives need oxygen way high?
Well, lot people will say, oh, not much oxygen there. air thinner.
OK, well, perhaps better way think that, remember talking
mechanical aspects breathing fact lungs don't really move
themselves, muscles, diaphragm intercostal muscles
move them? Well, lot reason lungs can fill readily air
don't much air lungs, low air pressure lungs
relative outside you. mean open mouth
[INHALES] nose breathe in, is, breathe nose mouth,
going happen air going move high pressure low pressure.
easy fill lungs. Even though need muscles move various


things around allow lungs fill, air going go high pressure low
pressure. [INHALES] listening, just took big inhale
nose. exhale, basically taking lungs state
pressure really high lungs, high pressure, like balloon full--
pressure lungs lungs full higher air outside.
pretty easy [EXHALES] expel air nose mouth. high
altitudes, air pressure lower. happens air pressure
lower outside body lungs not full air, don't really steep
gradient high pressure outside body low pressure inside lungs.
actually put lot effort breathing air lungs. really
exert lot force. get diaphragm, intercostal muscles working
really hard. might even find shoulders lifting breath
[INHALES] really generate lot force get enough air
oxygen lungs. Now, important principle understand humans,
species, really talking now humans,
inhale, active process. really need use muscles intercostals
diaphragm order inflate lungs. whole process made easier
air pressure outside body higher lungs
going fill really readily. Exhaling, least humans, passive thing.
just relax diaphragm relax intercostals let rib cage kind
fall back original position. inhaling active, exhaling passive.
happens high altitude air pressure low,
put lot energy breathing air lungs get equivalent amount

high altitude location, first days, going feel lightheaded maybe
headache. also going buildup carbon dioxide system.
whole balance oxygen carbon dioxide going disrupted. mention
because, yes, indeed, changes atmospheric gases high
altitudes, can impact much oxygen can bring system,
tissues. heard many explanations hard breathe
feel lousy altitude. Well, just discovered one reason, don't
steep high pressure low pressure gradient outside body
inside body. converse also true. altitude days
opportunity adjust-- lot athletes, instance, will go train


altitude. hard first days weeks, get really good
training altitude. number different adaptations occur terms

move quickly altitude-- say, training 8,000 feet 10,000
feet. hiking high level, adapted, come

going able essentially deliver far oxygen muscles per

high altitude, intercostal muscles diaphragms got
trained quite bit allowed generate air volume every breath.
words, muscles got stronger, got efficient driving
phrenic nerve consciously [INHALES] really breathe lot oxygen don't
feel lightheaded, headache, et cetera. OK, little bit aside.
important aside, believe, because, A, answers question lot people ask
lot people wonder and, B, incorporates mechanical
aspects breathing chemical aspects breathing. realize little bit
unusual circumstance. now anyone asks hard breathe altitude,
know lack high pressure low pressure gradient across
body atmosphere outside you. also opportunity say
find altitude headache feeling like just
can't catch breath, spending time really consciously trying draw larger
breaths air, much might seem fatiguing short breath, will
allow adapt quickly. little bit later episode, touch
methods, including deliberate hyperventilation combined breath holds,
can allow deliver oxygen cells immediately upon arriving altitude
don't get quite much headache, disorientation, on. leaving breathing
altitude aside come back conceptual level.

00:47:16 Tool: Sleep Apnea, Nasal Breathing

can ask ourselves, instance, healthy breathing, unhealthy

meat that. (Nasal Strips)

00:51:50 Brain Centers & Breathing Rhythm

already talked phrenic nerve, nerve innervates diaphragm
allows lungs fill movement diaphragm.
didn't talk about, however, brain centers actually control phrenic nerve
control breathing. Knowing two brain areas
extremely important, not just understanding content episode
understanding tools discuss and, indeed, general health


relates respiration. basically two areas brain control breathing.
first called pre-Botzinger complex. don't worry name
much. Just know named bottle wine discovered
great Jack Feldman, professor neuroscience University
California, Los Angeles. one fundamental discoveries
neuroscience last hundred years brain area Jack
colleagues discovered controls aspects breathing rhythmic, is,
inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. controlled small
set neurons brainstem area, around region neck, called pre-
Botzinger complex. really owe debt gratitude Jack colleagues
discovering area involved everything breathing
asleep breathing not thinking breathing. may role--
is, function disrupted, may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.
event, pre-Botzinger complex controlling inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale patterns
breathing. brain center controlling breathing, again, phrenic nerve-
- converges goes phrenic nerve intercostal muscles--
so-called parafacial nucleus. parafacial nucleus involved patterns
breathing not inhale followed exhale, inhale followed exhale--
is, not rhythmic, one other-- but, rather, doubling
inhales doubling exhales deliberate pause breathing, inhale, pause,


exhale, pause, inhale, pause, exhale, pause, sort thing. little bit later, talk
pattern breathing called box breathing, specific useful
applications, particular adjusting anxiety. case, involves going
rhythmic breathing inhale, inhale, inhale, exhale, is, relying pre-Botzinger
complex neurons, reliance parafacial nucleus neurons box breathing, just
give away probably already obvious, inhale, hold, exhale, hold,
repeat. pattern breathing, even though rhythmic nature
inhales precede exhales precede inhales on, deliberate breath hold
inserted there. anytime taking conscious control breathing, parafacial
nucleus getting involved. Now, don't assume parafacial nucleus
way take conscious control breathing. can also take
control pre-Botzinger complex. can right now. instance,
breathing specific pattern now that, unless speaking eating, no doubt
going involve inhales followed exhales. could, instance, decide that,
yes, inhales active exhales passive. now going make
exhales active well. rather just inhale let lungs deflate,
inhale [INHALES] force air out. [EXHALES] going represent
conscious taking control pre-Botzinger complex. reason
giving mechanistic detail is, A, super important want understand
tools related breathing. B, actually pretty simple system. Even though areas
fancy names like pre-Botzinger parafacial, pretty straightforward.
one area controls rhythmic breathing-- inhale follows exhales-- area
gets involved breathing time start doubling inhales exhales.
fact, parafacial nucleus one relying speak order
make sure still get enough oxygen. also one will use
incorporate physiological sigh box breathing. And, frankly, time,
using circuits brain systems, parafacial pre-Botzinger,
parallel. Again, biology loves parallel systems, especially things critical
didn't them, die, like breathing. makes sense
two different brain structures control this. now understanding
mechanical control breathing, is, different parts within parts list

said little bit earlier well, breathing incredible represents
interface conscious subconscious control not just body, not
just lungs, breathe influences brain state. using
brain consciously control breathing, using brain control
brain. best way ever heard described beautiful, say now
classic paper Journal Physiology, published 1988 Balestrino
Somjen, final line summary intro states, "The brain, regulating
breathing, controls excitability." just remind don't
remember excitability is, excitability threshold given neuron, nerve

ways, brain becomes harder activate. excitability reduced. Now,
might think excitability great thing. always want brain excitable.
actually not case. And, fact, statement Balestrino Somjen
made led number investigations really important defining
people overbreathe, is, hyperventilate, rest, expel, is, exhale

beautiful paper asks, pattern breathing, particular,


overbreathing, change patterns activity brain? paper entitled
"Effects Voluntary Hyperventilation Cortical Sensory Responses." will provide
link study show note captions. somewhat complicated paper
look detailed analyzes. However, takeaway paper exquisitely
simple also believe incredibly important. Basically, showed
people hyperventilate, expel, is, exhale carbon dioxide

body. carbon dioxide level drops low, say, OK, well, still
bringing lot oxygen, people hyperventilating.
feel really alert. And, indeed, happens. people feel alert. However,
not bringing enough carbon dioxide or, rather, proper way say
overbreathing, exhaling much, not retaining
keeping enough carbon dioxide. Well, lack carbon dioxide means
oxygen breathing can't liberated hemoglobin, can't get
brain. observe 30% 40% reduction amount oxygen
delivered brain. reduction carbon dioxide also prevents
normal patterns vasodilation, dilating, opening
capillaries, so, again, less blood flow. importantly, shown paper,
brain overall becomes hyperexcitable. starved oxygen blood

means hyperventilate, aren't retaining enough carbon

consequence that, brain becomes hyperexcitable. actually know
increase anxiety. become less good, less efficient detecting things

realize people listening not epileptic. nonetheless, brings
us back question normal healthy breathing. mentioned before,
normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath

involve two things. First all, nasal breathing, resistance provides
nose talked earlier, going deliver oxygen
system. going able generate air pressure fill lungs.
greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen
carbon dioxide proper ways, also taking pauses breaths.
extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.

minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing

research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly

not, certain personality types. talk breathing personality type
actually breathing shown alter personality. right. Breathing can
alter personality positive ways allow anyone show various social

really quite simple. got nose, obviously, got mouth.

00:18:18 Breathing Mechanics

little bit later, talk incredible advantages nasal breather
time also incredible advantages using mouth breathe
inhales exhales particular types endeavors. get back
little later. meantime, two ways bring air system
nose mouth. also larynx, rigid
tissue pipe brings air nose mouth lungs. Now,
word rigid really important will soon learn lungs
basically act like pump. sort know already. two big bags
basically can fill air can squeeze air out. Now, people don't
realize lungs not just big bags air. lungs actually big
bags air inside hundreds millions little sacs called


alveoli lungs. hundreds millions little sacs, increase
surface area lungs. increasing surface area, allow
oxygen pass air lungs bloodstream didn't
sacs. allow carbon dioxide move bloodstream
sacs lungs, exhale, carbon dioxide can removed.
little sacs call alveoli lungs important part mechanical
aspect breathing get little bit later. first pass, mechanical aspects
breathing really straightforward. can breathe nose. can
mouth. goes larynx. told larynx rigid pipe.
lungs not rigid. can expand can contract like pump bring
air expel air. Keep mind lungs not muscles themselves.
need muscles can either squeeze lungs will allow lungs
expand. two general groups muscles that,
diaphragm so-called intercostal muscles. diaphragm thin muscle
sits lungs liver. inhale, provided using
called diaphragmatic breathing, diaphragm contracts. contracts,
moves down, allows space lungs inflate air. Now,
intercostal muscles muscles ribs. number people probably
don't realize this. ribs, course, bone, bones,
muscles. intercostal muscles, inhale, contract, allows
rib cage move expand bit. think, again, people probably don't
realize ribs not fixed place. can actually get closer apart
one another. inhale, rib cage actually moves up. Sometimes
shoulders will move well. intercostal muscles
contracting. Now, muscles can't move own. controlled nerves.
got nose, mouth, larynx, lungs. lungs little
alveoli them. told you, got diaphragm muscle move
lungs, intercostal muscles move ribs, can allow lungs
expand. Again, just mechanical components breathing.
muscles can't move themselves, asking, moves muscles?
really nerves control muscles. whether not contracting biceps
walking contracting quadriceps hamstrings
calf muscles, neurons, nerve cells control that. specialized nerve called
phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C, phrenic nerve, comes neck.


say comes neck, mean little neurons reside
brainstem, back brain, send little wires call axons
neck. go close heart little bit behind it. go
down, form synapses. is, form connections diaphragm.
neurons release neurotransmitters, little chemicals, diaphragm
contracts, moves down. say phrenic nerve motor nerve.
designed move muscle. However, phrenic nerve, like nerves
body, interesting not just motor nerves there, neurons control
contraction muscles. also can sense things, sensory neurons. also sends
connections diaphragm actually deep diaphragm
close liver. note said liver twice now already, going get
back later talk physical movement cramps body.
sensory neurons dive deep diaphragm. go back brain,
allow sense diaphragm is. giving information
diaphragm body. Now, time, not paying attention
this. right now, can actually try this. encourage this.
Diaphragmatic breathing is, many ways, ideal way breathe
efficient way breathe. talk mean exactly say breathing
efficiency later. diaphragm designed allow lungs expand contract
lungs, bring air body remove carbon dioxide body.
want know whether not using diaphragmatic breathing, simple.
inhale-- probably best nose,
mouth. inhale belly moves outward inhale, well, phrenic
nerve controlling diaphragm properly. exhale, belly
go just little bit. diaphragmatic breathing. Now, diaphragmatic
breathing talked context yoga. often talked way calm
on. diaphragmatic breathing just one mode brain
phrenic nerve can control muscle, diaphragm, control mechanical aspects
lungs bring air expel air. mentioned before, also
muscles ribs intercostal muscles. separate set
nerves allow muscles contract rib cage expand order
create room lungs get larger fill air rib cage
contract bit muscles relax order expel air. like go record
saying no rule diaphragmatic breathing better breathing


rib cage moves. common misconception. People say, oh, shoulders
going rib cage moving breathing, well,
not breathing right. belly goes rest body still
breathe, well, breathing correctly. know zero-- fact, zero
minus one data support statement. multiple parallel mechanisms
control mechanics lungs breathing. exerting
hard, tend use intercostal muscles rib cage moving well
diaphragm order bring lot oxygen offload lot carbon
dioxide. calmer, frankly, use diaphragmatic breathing
use rib cage type breathing order bring enough oxygen system.
no real data showing diaphragmatic breathing somehow better worse.
However, able mechanically control independently combine
use together tremendous power toward regulating mental
physical states. talk little bit later. right now, please
understand different mechanical components allow bring
oxygen system expel air thereby offload carbon dioxide
system. Again, haven't talked gas exchange carbon dioxide oxygen
happening bloodstream. talk next. basic
mechanical components pretty simple. again, just review, nose, mouth,
larynx, lungs, alveoli within lungs, two muscles, diaphragm
intercostal muscles ribs. one thing failed mention
important larynx rigid, tube rigid. reason
unlike lungs, want act sort bellow pump

now try nose, please exhale try

also wipes away common misconception, somebody

immensely useful mental physical challenges.


00:31:23 Chemistry Breathing, Hyperventilation



now talk chemical aspects breathing. two major players
discussion oxygen, cells tissues body need, carbon
dioxide, cells tissues body need. fact, carbon dioxide plays
critical roles delivering oxygen cells. without carbon dioxide, not
going get enough oxygen cells tissues body. said, carbon
dioxide levels high, problematic. fact, one ways one can
reliably induce panic anybody breathe air contains much
carbon dioxide, much people lack so-called amygdala-- many
probably heard amygdala. brain area associated fear
threat detection. Even people completely lack amygdalas sides
brain removed epileptic seizures and,
therefore, people completely unafraid things afraid
like heights, poisonous snakes, number different things dangerous humans,
well, people breathe excess amount carbon dioxide, immediately
panic attack. tells us that, again, parallel mechanisms,
redundancy system protect much carbon dioxide
system. need enough carbon dioxide enough oxygen system
not much. way accomplished is, course, breathe air. lungs
inflate. recall little alveoli lungs, little sacs, oxygen can
actually move air little sacs little sacs
vasculature-- vasculature capillaries, veins, arteries body--
walls little alveoli exceedingly thin, tons little
capillaries go around them. amazing, right?
oxygen literally passing inside little sacs lungs inhaled
oxygen air bloodstream, oxygen gets bound
proteins blood, particular hemoglobin. hemoglobin delivers oxygen
various cells tissues body. However, oxygen can't just hop hemoglobin
cruise along hemoglobin gets to, say, brain hop off.
doesn't work way. require carbon dioxide order liberate oxygen
hemoglobin. Carbon dioxide incredible property actually able change
shape hemoglobin. Hemoglobin shaped sort cage around oxygen
molecules. cage shape, oxygen can't liberated.
got oxygen hemoglobin bound one another moving bloodstream.
tissue needs oxygen, needs carbon dioxide present open


cage. carbon dioxide does. allows cage change shape,
oxygen can liberated can delivered tissues, whether
not brain tissue muscle tissue, forth. major
chemical components breathing. aspects related
chemical components breathing, fact carbon dioxide strongly
related acidic basic body general. instance, carbon
dioxide levels go way down, blood pH goes way up. is, become
alkaline. Now, many people, word pH whole concept pH immediately
starts evoke anxiety itself. pH actually simple. want body
basically pH 7.4. regions body, particular
along gut, number importantly different order digestion work
properly. heard gut microbiome, little microbes that, provided
enough diverse enough, allow brain body function
optimally level immune system, hormone system, brain, et cetera. Well,
gut, want pH sometimes slightly acidic. acidic,
little microbiota flourish far basic. basically, want
rest body pH 7.4. carbon dioxide levels go low, pH
increases way might say, oh, well, bad, actually allows
oxygen available tissues body, least temporarily. talk
bit later. losing you, just hang almost
done whole business mechanics chemistry breathing,
can get tools revisit later clean misunderstandings
may arisen. talking carbon dioxide
key carbon dioxide problems going high low,
probably asking yourself, actually makes carbon dioxide go low?
know breathe oxygen, can pass lungs alveoli
bloodstream need carbon dioxide liberate oxygen
hemoglobin cells tissues body. know exhale--
well, actually, haven't told yet. know exhale,
carbon dioxide actually taken bloodstream back alveoli lungs.
exhale, expelled mouth nose
world. way just described that-- inhale, bring oxygen, exhale, expel
carbon dioxide-- pretty straightforward, right? Indeed, is. also tells
exhale lot lot vigorously, expel carbon dioxide.


fact, exactly way works. hyperventilate, course,
inhaling usual, also exhaling usual. you're,
course, bringing air oxygen body. also removing
carbon dioxide body normal. Carbon dioxide, ways
regulates brain state-- fact, way regulates excitability, literally
ability neurons engage electrically not-- can create states panic

safe place don't anxiety panic attack tendencies. just
breathe nose mouth. Remember, breathing
vigorously, exhaling vigorously
normally would. goes something like this. [INHALING, EXHALING] Now, breath 8
9 10, notice body starts heat up. due couple things,
mainly release adrenaline adrenals. already feeling little bit
lightheaded. lightheadedness actually vasculature, capillaries
veins and, extent, even arteries body particularly
brain, actually starting constrict. cutting off blood flow brain. Why?
Well, carbon dioxide actually vasodilator. Normally, exists body
keep capillaries, veins, arteries dilated allow blood pass them.
hyperventilate, sure, bringing lot oxygen, think make
alert, and, indeed, does. also expelling lot carbon dioxide
normally would. causing vasoconstriction, going
start feeling tingly periphery, fingers toes perhaps legs.
will also notice feeling alert brain might start feel
bit anxiety. hyperventilation, yes, brings oxygen, also removes


carbon dioxide. removal excess carbon dioxide puts state called
hypocapnic, hypoxia. Hypoxia reduced levels oxygen relative normal.
Hypocapnia reduced levels carbon dioxide relative normal.
reduced levels carbon dioxide largely responsible elevation energy
time feeling bit anxiety, construction
microvasculature brain body, therefore feelings kind tingly

oxygen carbon dioxide. across course episode,

00:40:35 High Altitudes, Oxygen & Breathing

will explain adjust ratios oxygen carbon dioxide depending
immediate needs plan next, whether not sleep
exercise mental work, et cetera. going further, however,
something want touch on. even though not everyone will experience this,
think enough people experience interest, now's right time touch
happens go high altitude, meaning hard
breathe get high altitudes. close sea level, getting
optimal balance oxygen air breathe. ascend altitude--
say go 6,000 feet 10,000 maybe even 11,000 feet sea level.
maybe one rare individuals climbs Denali, climb Mount
Everest, get there, notice people going wear
oxygen mask. need oxygen mask high altitudes
people high altitude skydives need oxygen way high?
Well, lot people will say, oh, not much oxygen there. air thinner.
OK, well, perhaps better way think that, remember talking
mechanical aspects breathing fact lungs don't really move
themselves, muscles, diaphragm intercostal muscles
move them? Well, lot reason lungs can fill readily air
don't much air lungs, low air pressure lungs
relative outside you. mean open mouth
[INHALES] nose breathe in, is, breathe nose mouth,
going happen air going move high pressure low pressure.
easy fill lungs. Even though need muscles move various


things around allow lungs fill, air going go high pressure low
pressure. [INHALES] listening, just took big inhale
nose. exhale, basically taking lungs state
pressure really high lungs, high pressure, like balloon full--
pressure lungs lungs full higher air outside.
pretty easy [EXHALES] expel air nose mouth. high
altitudes, air pressure lower. happens air pressure
lower outside body lungs not full air, don't really steep
gradient high pressure outside body low pressure inside lungs.
actually put lot effort breathing air lungs. really
exert lot force. get diaphragm, intercostal muscles working
really hard. might even find shoulders lifting breath
[INHALES] really generate lot force get enough air
oxygen lungs. Now, important principle understand humans,
species, really talking now humans,
inhale, active process. really need use muscles intercostals
diaphragm order inflate lungs. whole process made easier
air pressure outside body higher lungs
going fill really readily. Exhaling, least humans, passive thing.
just relax diaphragm relax intercostals let rib cage kind
fall back original position. inhaling active, exhaling passive.
happens high altitude air pressure low,
put lot energy breathing air lungs get equivalent amount

high altitude location, first days, going feel lightheaded maybe
headache. also going buildup carbon dioxide system.
whole balance oxygen carbon dioxide going disrupted. mention
because, yes, indeed, changes atmospheric gases high

words, muscles got stronger, got efficient driving
phrenic nerve consciously [INHALES] really breathe lot oxygen don't
feel lightheaded, headache, et cetera. OK, little bit aside.
important aside, believe, because, A, answers question lot people ask
lot people wonder and, B, incorporates mechanical
aspects breathing chemical aspects breathing. realize little bit
unusual circumstance. now anyone asks hard breathe altitude,
know lack high pressure low pressure gradient across
body atmosphere outside you. also opportunity say
find altitude headache feeling like just
can't catch breath, spending time really consciously trying draw larger
breaths air, much might seem fatiguing short breath, will
allow adapt quickly. little bit later episode, touch
methods, including deliberate hyperventilation combined breath holds,
can allow deliver oxygen cells immediately upon arriving altitude
don't get quite much headache, disorientation, on. leaving breathing
altitude aside come back conceptual level.

00:47:16 Tool: Sleep Apnea, Nasal Breathing

00:51:50 Brain Centers & Breathing Rhythm

already talked phrenic nerve, nerve innervates diaphragm
allows lungs fill movement diaphragm.
didn't talk about, however, brain centers actually control phrenic nerve
control breathing. Knowing two brain areas
extremely important, not just understanding content episode
understanding tools discuss and, indeed, general health


relates respiration. basically two areas brain control breathing.
first called pre-Botzinger complex. don't worry name
much. Just know named bottle wine discovered
great Jack Feldman, professor neuroscience University
California, Los Angeles. one fundamental discoveries
neuroscience last hundred years brain area Jack
colleagues discovered controls aspects breathing rhythmic, is,
inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. controlled small
set neurons brainstem area, around region neck, called pre-
Botzinger complex. really owe debt gratitude Jack colleagues
discovering area involved everything breathing
asleep breathing not thinking breathing. may role--
is, function disrupted, may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.
event, pre-Botzinger complex controlling inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale patterns
breathing. brain center controlling breathing, again, phrenic nerve-
- converges goes phrenic nerve intercostal muscles--
so-called parafacial nucleus. parafacial nucleus involved patterns
breathing not inhale followed exhale, inhale followed exhale--
is, not rhythmic, one other-- but, rather, doubling
inhales doubling exhales deliberate pause breathing, inhale, pause,


exhale, pause, inhale, pause, exhale, pause, sort thing. little bit later, talk
pattern breathing called box breathing, specific useful
applications, particular adjusting anxiety. case, involves going
rhythmic breathing inhale, inhale, inhale, exhale, is, relying pre-Botzinger
complex neurons, reliance parafacial nucleus neurons box breathing, just
give away probably already obvious, inhale, hold, exhale, hold,
repeat. pattern breathing, even though rhythmic nature
inhales precede exhales precede inhales on, deliberate breath hold
inserted there. anytime taking conscious control breathing, parafacial
nucleus getting involved. Now, don't assume parafacial nucleus
way take conscious control breathing. can also take
control pre-Botzinger complex. can right now. instance,
breathing specific pattern now that, unless speaking eating, no doubt
going involve inhales followed exhales. could, instance, decide that,
yes, inhales active exhales passive. now going make
exhales active well. rather just inhale let lungs deflate,
inhale [INHALES] force air out. [EXHALES] going represent
conscious taking control pre-Botzinger complex. reason
giving mechanistic detail is, A, super important want understand
tools related breathing. B, actually pretty simple system. Even though areas
fancy names like pre-Botzinger parafacial, pretty straightforward.
one area controls rhythmic breathing-- inhale follows exhales-- area
gets involved breathing time start doubling inhales exhales.
fact, parafacial nucleus one relying speak order
make sure still get enough oxygen. also one will use
incorporate physiological sigh box breathing. And, frankly, time,
using circuits brain systems, parafacial pre-Botzinger,
parallel. Again, biology loves parallel systems, especially things critical
didn't them, die, like breathing. makes sense
two different brain structures control this. now understanding
mechanical control breathing, is, different parts within parts list
involved breathing,

00:57:23 Brain, Hyperventilation & “Over-breathing”

said little bit earlier well, breathing incredible represents
interface conscious subconscious control not just body, not
just lungs, breathe influences brain state. using
brain consciously control breathing, using brain control
brain. best way ever heard described beautiful, say now
classic paper Journal Physiology, published 1988 Balestrino
Somjen, final line summary intro states, "The brain, regulating
breathing, controls excitability." just remind don't
remember excitability is, excitability threshold given neuron, nerve

likely get engaged. likely active. breathe
ways, brain becomes harder activate. excitability reduced. Now,
might think excitability great thing. always want brain excitable.
actually not case. And, fact, statement Balestrino Somjen
made led number investigations really important defining
people overbreathe, is, hyperventilate, rest, expel, is, exhale

incredible things brain can do, need signal get noise.
beautiful paper asks, pattern breathing, particular,


overbreathing, change patterns activity brain? paper entitled
"Effects Voluntary Hyperventilation Cortical Sensory Responses." will provide
link study show note captions. somewhat complicated paper
look detailed analyzes. However, takeaway paper exquisitely
simple also believe incredibly important. Basically, showed
people hyperventilate, expel, is, exhale carbon dioxide

low blood. short period time, become low tissues
body. carbon dioxide level drops low, say, OK, well, still
bringing lot oxygen, people hyperventilating.
feel really alert. And, indeed, happens. people feel alert. However,
not bringing enough carbon dioxide or, rather, proper way say
overbreathing, exhaling much, not retaining
keeping enough carbon dioxide. Well, lack carbon dioxide means
oxygen breathing can't liberated hemoglobin, can't get
brain. observe 30% 40% reduction amount oxygen
delivered brain. reduction carbon dioxide also prevents
normal patterns vasodilation, dilating, opening
capillaries, so, again, less blood flow. importantly, shown paper,
brain overall becomes hyperexcitable. starved oxygen blood
flow. neurons nonspecific way start increasing firing levels.
background activity getting louder louder. like rumble noise

touch event world doesn't get noise.
means hyperventilate, aren't retaining enough carbon
dioxide, not getting enough oxygen tissues need oxygen.
consequence that, brain becomes hyperexcitable. actually know
increase anxiety. become less good, less efficient detecting things
environment. not processing information well all. noise goes up,
signal goes down. Again, incredibly important set findings. also mention
hyperventilation one way that, laboratory anyway neurosurgery units
time, physicians evoke seizure seizure-prone patients. reason
works exactly explanation just gave you. Seizure excitability brain,
not enough inhibition suppression overall circuitry. get waves


storms electrical activity. Low levels carbon dioxide brain
low levels carbon dioxide blood one major triggers seizures. Now,
realize people listening not epileptic. nonetheless, brings
us back question normal healthy breathing. mentioned before,
normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath
minute passes? No. find correct pattern breathing going
involve two things. First all, nasal breathing, resistance provides
nose talked earlier, going deliver oxygen
system. going able generate air pressure fill lungs.
greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen
carbon dioxide proper ways, also taking pauses breaths.
extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.


01:09:44 Tool: Train Healthy Breathing, Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test & Box Breathing

next, like address can normal patterns breathing,
is, anyone can adjust normal patterns breathing unhealthy

start, meaning slowly control exhale nose. trying let air
slowly possible. just going call every 10 15 seconds so.
want note lungs empty. know can hold breath
lungs empty. not accurate measure. 15 seconds. important
note lungs empty trying control exhale much
possible don't arrive lungs empty time quickly. explain

01:22:39 Tool: Breathwork & Stress Reduction; Cyclic Sighing

restore normal patterns breathing not overbreathe therefore not eliminate
much carbon dioxide exactly two tests incorporated study
laboratory collaboration associate chair psychiatry Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. David Spiegel, also guest podcast
previously. study explored box breathing. also explored forms
breathing actually compared forms deliberate breathing meditation
means explore going minimal effective doses effective
ways chronically reduce stress around clock improve mood improve
sleep. study referring just published recently. entitled "Brief
Structured Respiration Practices Enhance Mood Reduce Physiological Arousal."
will also provide link paper show note captions. study really
focused simple question, is, shortest effective
practice people can use order reduce levels stress not just


breathwork practice meditation practice around clock, 24 hours day,
including improvements sleep? excited study many
studies explored meditation or, cases, fewer studies explored
breathwork can impact different brain states bodily states. studies
explored breathwork meditation practices influenced body-brain states
around clock people not performing particular meditation
breathwork practice. reason able study really fortunate.
folks WHOOP generous enough donate bunch WHOOP straps,
allowed us measure heart rate variability, number different
physiological parameters. also got subjective reports people's mood
feelings well-being. got data sleep pinged us remote locations.
people, rather brought laboratory artificial
circumstance, laboratory, much like think laboratory realistic--
virtual reality things like that-- nothing realistic real world.
able hundred subjects real world living
real lives pinging back us data time, 24 hours day measure
different interventions asked do, breathwork practices
meditation practices, impacting physiological parameters. also
informing us regularly subjective mood, et cetera. got lot data,
can imagine. basic takeaway study twofold. First all,
discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly
lead improvements focus memory, not much reductions stress, although
lead reductions stress. found number different
breathwork practices-- explored three-- done five minutes day outperformed
meditation terms ability breathwork reduce stress around clock
compared meditation. three types breathwork explored also showed
different effects. mention three types breathwork compared


box breathing sort just learned about. compare something
called cyclic sighing, involves two inhales nose get maximally
inflated lungs followed long exhale. return moment.
repeated five minutes time session. third breathwork practice,
cyclic hyperventilation, which, name suggests, involves people inhaling
deeply nose, exhaling passively mouth, repeating
inhale nose, exhale mouth, repeating 25 cycles, one
cycle inhale exhale. equals one cycle. Repeating 25
cycles, exhaling air holding breath lungs empty 15
30 seconds, repeating inhale, exhale, cyclic hyperventilation duration
five minutes. people divided different groups, either mindfulness
meditation sat, not told control breathing specific
way. closed eyes. focused attention region just behind
forehead. One group that. group cyclic sighing. Another group box
breathing. Another group cyclic hyperventilation. sort clinical trial like
to, swapped people different groups. served
control. evaluate within individual variability. Again,
lot data paper. takeaway sake stress reduction
around clock sake improving sleep mood, effective
practice four practices examined cyclic sighing. Again, cyclic
sighing performed following way. inhale nose deeply
can. second inhale immediately afterwards try maximally inflate
lungs. fact, happens. know second inhale, even
just sharp, short inhale, extra physical vigor required generate
second inhale causes alveoli lungs, may collapsed-- and,
indeed, breaths often even just course day
especially get stressed, alveoli lungs start collapse.
damp inside-- little bit fluid. like balloon
little bit fluid middle. takes little bit physical force pop open. Now,
not literally exploding pop. reinflating air.
perform long exhale mouth lungs empty. looks exactly like
this. [INHALES DEEPLY] [INHALES SHARPLY] [EXHALES] Now, know one
single physiological sigh sort just described performed time day
conditions, whether not walk stage give talk


meeting feeling stressed, conversation
stressful, can feel stress mounting traffic number
psychological physical stressors may approaching feel
oppressing you, one physiological sigh sort just described
fastest physiologically verified way aware reduce levels stress
reintroduce calm, is, shift autonomic nervous system state
heightened levels autonomic arousal. is, sympathetic nervous system as,
called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything
so-called fight flight, although controls things, too, including positive
arousal. parasympathetic nervous system, often referred rest
digest system, although things, too, associated calming. two
things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep
inhale, short second inhale also nose, long exhale completely
lungs empty, known restore level balance sympathetic-parasympathetic
neural circuitry fastest way reintroduce calm. one physiological sigh.
study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.
translated, again, sorts positive subjective changes-- improvements
sleep, lower resting heart rate times day. important. Again, study
not just exploring happens meditation breathwork, cyclic sighing, et
cetera. exploring changes occur practice translate
changes breathing heart rate, mood, et cetera, throughout 24-hour cycle.
takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress
reduction practice now supported data translate reductions stress
around clock, data say want invest cyclic sighing, is,
double inhale nose, extended exhale mouth lungs


empty, repeat five minutes day. You, course, like,
meditation. still positive effects, meaning reduced stress, although not much
cyclic sighing. box breathing want purpose reducing
stress. practices explored reduce stress. cyclic sighing performed
five minutes day robust pervasive effect reducing stress,
improving mood, improving sleep. first message study. second
takeaway one physiological sigh-- right just one physiological sigh,
inhale deeply nose another inhale nose maximally inflate
alveoli lungs, exhale completely lungs empty go
back normal breathing, fastest way introduce level calm reduce
overall levels stress real time. important. think
days, hear lot stress reduction techniques. stress
reduction techniques explored, everything massage meditation
breathwork hot shower foot rub, will calm down. question is,
calm just practice? Great does. also translate
reduced levels stress times 24-hour cycle positive effects
well? one physiological sigh efficient way adjust ratio sympathetic
parasympathetic activation immediately bring calm. excellent
real-time control stress. thing physiological sighs not
hack. not application breathing practice something wasn't intended
for. fact, physiological sighs not discovered all. discovered

01:39:16 Breathing & Heart Rate Variability

organs neighborhood, talk relationship
breathing heart rate. incredibly important topic, much
perhaps brought beginning episode. nonetheless,
now know diaphragm does. inhale, diaphragm moves down.
right. contract diaphragm, moves down. creates space
lungs inhale. exhale, diaphragm moves up. Well, inhale
diaphragm moves down, happens space created


thoracic cavity particularly also breathing deeply using
intercostal muscles expand ribs. consequence, heart actually gets
little bit bigger. temporary enlargement heart. real enlargement.
consequence, whatever blood heart now larger volume
heart got bigger. consequence, blood moving slowly

exhale. exhale, diaphragm moves up. rib cage tends move
inward bit. compact heart. reduce volume heart overall.
reduce volume heart overall, blood flow heart
accelerates smaller volume. given unit blood going move
quickly small volume. nervous system detects sends
signal slow heart down. just inhales speed heart up, exhales slow
heart rate down. Now, course, even though can double inhales even
triple inhales, sooner later, inhale, going exhale.
converse also true, course. mean terms controlling
heart rate? Well, say going blood draw, going stage

physiological sighs bring level calm level stress down.
Nonetheless, reason want quickly reduce heart rate

additionally, not just use physiological sigh, well, can take advantage
relationship inhales exhales controlling heart rate. want increase
heart rate, can simply inhale longer vigorously relative
exhales. want decrease heart rate, well, going make
exhales longer and/or vigorous inhales. fact, process,
called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, basis call heart rate variability.
Heart rate variability involves vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve,
parasympathetic nerve associated calming aspect autonomic
nervous system, slowing heart rate extending exhales. really
forms basis breathing practices. look breathing practices,

feature, physicians call respiratory sinus arrhythmia, sometimes hear
often nowadays heart rate variability, something people sport

number different contexts, including sport, military. also now
incorporated clinical context people feel panic attack coming on.
gratified learn physiological sigh now explored tool prevent

exhale really terrific skill master, easy skill master, frankly.
say skill? Well, remember said earlier, humans inhale actively


typically will passively exhale, just let air [EXHALES] drop
whatever rate, depending much air inhaled. Actively exhaling, is,
actively relaxing diaphragm actively relaxing intercostal muscles

think people agree one hiccup sort funny.

01:46:21 Tool: Stop Hiccups

Two hiccups row really funny. three hiccups row starts
concerning, part hiccups can kind painful. can experience pain
gut lower abdomen sometimes chest well. feels kind

Fortunately, simple way get rid hiccups. can arrive simple
technique understand little bit gives rise hiccups. reason
get hiccups experience spasm phrenic nerve. phrenic
nerve, recall, nerve emanates cervical region, specific C3,

Again, doesn't tend work lot time. people, works every time.
people, doesn't work all. However, technique can reliably
eliminate hiccups. technique takes advantage hypercontracting
phrenic nerve short period time subsequently relaxes
alleviates spasming phrenic nerve. simple method inhale three
times row. unusual pattern breathing. involves taking
big, deep inhale nose. exhale air, take second
inhale nose, however brief inhale might be, third even micro
millisecond long inhale nose get third inhale. hold
breath 15 20 seconds, slowly exhale. even though not

title paper "Nasal Respiration Entrains Human Limbic Oscillations
Modulates Cognitive Function." paper followed earlier paper
showed people breathe nose, recognition
discrimination different odors far greater breathe
mouth. Now, result interesting, also sort duh smell
things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal
inhalations versus nasal exhalations versus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.
basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal
noise talked earlier, recall, ability brain detect things
environment, increased inhalations. earlier study focused
smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate
variables. paper, one just mentioned, "Nasal Respiration Entrains
Human Limbic Oscillations Modulates Cognitive Function," not look
detection odors. Rather, looked things like reaction time fear. basically,
found reaction time greatly reduced people inhaling.
people look fearful stimuli. looked reaction time fearful stimuli,
words, ability detect certain kinds stimuli. given lot
different kinds stimuli. able discriminate one sort of--
oops, excuse me. way, folks, listening, just bumped microphone,
getting rather animated here. subjects detect one type

people inhaling fear-inducing stimulus presented, reaction

detect epileptic seizures. lot study lot discuss.
basic takeaway people inhaling, is, drawing air
nose particular, ability detect going world
around greatly enhanced not just fear also surprise sorts.
people inhaling, ability detect novel stimuli, things unexpected
unusual environment, significantly increased. Again, put link
study well. find one interesting studies realm,
although now many additional studies support statement made
earlier, inhalation, also called inspiration, number
fast physiological changes, changes pupil diameter, changes activity

research study really want learn information-- maybe listening
podcast sorts information want retain-- actually makes
sense increase duration intensity inhales that.
inhaling relative exhaling terms duration, brain

Now, one caveat think important know number
people listen podcast sake gleaning tools not just cognitive enhancement
physical enhancement. turns inhaling air, actually
less able or, say, less efficient generating voluntary movements. Now,
might come surprise. now, basically talking inhalation
great, almost point wonder like, exhalation good anything?
don't want overbreathe kick much carbon dioxide. Well, course
exhalation great things. fact, somebody played baseball

engage intercostal muscles. Whereas exhales tend passive unless
take active control exhale. And, indeed, ability generate fast, directed, so-


called volitional, voluntary movements greatly enhanced
exhale, not inhale. Now, said, haven't yet really talked mouth
versus nasal breathing.

02:09:15 Mouth vs. Nasal Breathing, Aesthetics

really can fairly short discussion abundant data now show

called diaphragmatic breathing, diaphragm contracts. contracts,

intercostal muscles muscles ribs. number people probably
don't realize this. ribs, course, bone, bones,

rib cage move expand bit. think, again, people probably don't
realize ribs not fixed place. can actually get closer apart

lungs, intercostal muscles move ribs, can allow lungs
expand. Again, just mechanical components breathing.
muscles can't move themselves, asking, moves muscles?
really nerves control muscles. whether not contracting biceps
walking contracting quadriceps hamstrings
calf muscles, neurons, nerve cells control that. specialized nerve called
phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C, phrenic nerve, comes neck.


say comes neck, mean little neurons reside

this. right now, can actually try this. encourage this.
Diaphragmatic breathing is, many ways, ideal way breathe
efficient way breathe. talk mean exactly say breathing

lungs, bring air body remove carbon dioxide body.
want know whether not using diaphragmatic breathing, simple.
inhale-- probably best nose,

no real data showing diaphragmatic breathing somehow better worse.
However, able mechanically control independently combine

00:31:23 Chemistry Breathing, Hyperventilation



now talk chemical aspects breathing. two major players
discussion oxygen, cells tissues body need, carbon
dioxide, cells tissues body need. fact, carbon dioxide plays
critical roles delivering oxygen cells. without carbon dioxide, not
going get enough oxygen cells tissues body. said, carbon
dioxide levels high, problematic. fact, one ways one can
reliably induce panic anybody breathe air contains much
carbon dioxide, much people lack so-called amygdala-- many
probably heard amygdala. brain area associated fear
threat detection. Even people completely lack amygdalas sides
brain removed epileptic seizures and,
therefore, people completely unafraid things afraid
like heights, poisonous snakes, number different things dangerous humans,
well, people breathe excess amount carbon dioxide, immediately
panic attack. tells us that, again, parallel mechanisms,
redundancy system protect much carbon dioxide
system. need enough carbon dioxide enough oxygen system
not much. way accomplished is, course, breathe air. lungs
inflate. recall little alveoli lungs, little sacs, oxygen can
actually move air little sacs little sacs
vasculature-- vasculature capillaries, veins, arteries body--
walls little alveoli exceedingly thin, tons little
capillaries go around them. amazing, right?
oxygen literally passing inside little sacs lungs inhaled

got oxygen hemoglobin bound one another moving bloodstream.
tissue needs oxygen, needs carbon dioxide present open

oxygen can liberated can delivered tissues, whether
not brain tissue muscle tissue, forth. major
chemical components breathing. aspects related
chemical components breathing, fact carbon dioxide strongly
related acidic basic body general. instance, carbon

alkaline. Now, many people, word pH whole concept pH immediately
starts evoke anxiety itself. pH actually simple. want body
basically pH 7.4. regions body, particular
along gut, number importantly different order digestion work

enough diverse enough, allow brain body function
optimally level immune system, hormone system, brain, et cetera. Well,
gut, want pH sometimes slightly acidic. acidic,
little microbiota flourish far basic. basically, want
rest body pH 7.4. carbon dioxide levels go low, pH
increases way might say, oh, well, bad, actually allows
oxygen available tissues body, least temporarily. talk
bit later. losing you, just hang almost
done whole business mechanics chemistry breathing,
can get tools revisit later clean misunderstandings
may arisen. talking carbon dioxide
key carbon dioxide problems going high low,
probably asking yourself, actually makes carbon dioxide go low?
know breathe oxygen, can pass lungs alveoli
bloodstream need carbon dioxide liberate oxygen
hemoglobin cells tissues body. know exhale--
well, actually, haven't told yet. know exhale,
carbon dioxide actually taken bloodstream back alveoli lungs.
exhale, expelled mouth nose
world. way just described that-- inhale, bring oxygen, exhale, expel
carbon dioxide-- pretty straightforward, right? Indeed, is. also tells
exhale lot lot vigorously, expel carbon dioxide.


fact, exactly way works. hyperventilate, course,
inhaling usual, also exhaling usual. you're,
course, bringing air oxygen body. also removing
carbon dioxide body normal. Carbon dioxide, ways

mainly release adrenaline adrenals. already feeling little bit

brain, actually starting constrict. cutting off blood flow brain. Why?
Well, carbon dioxide actually vasodilator. Normally, exists body
keep capillaries, veins, arteries dilated allow blood pass them.
hyperventilate, sure, bringing lot oxygen, think make

normally would. causing vasoconstriction, going
start feeling tingly periphery, fingers toes perhaps legs.
will also notice feeling alert brain might start feel
bit anxiety. hyperventilation, yes, brings oxygen, also removes


carbon dioxide. removal excess carbon dioxide puts state called
hypocapnic, hypoxia. Hypoxia reduced levels oxygen relative normal.
Hypocapnia reduced levels carbon dioxide relative normal.
reduced levels carbon dioxide largely responsible elevation energy

oxygen carbon dioxide. across course episode,

00:40:35 High Altitudes, Oxygen & Breathing

will explain adjust ratios oxygen carbon dioxide depending
immediate needs plan next, whether not sleep
exercise mental work, et cetera. going further, however,
something want touch on. even though not everyone will experience this,
think enough people experience interest, now's right time touch
happens go high altitude, meaning hard
breathe get high altitudes. close sea level, getting
optimal balance oxygen air breathe. ascend altitude--
say go 6,000 feet 10,000 maybe even 11,000 feet sea level.
maybe one rare individuals climbs Denali, climb Mount
Everest, get there, notice people going wear
oxygen mask. need oxygen mask high altitudes
people high altitude skydives need oxygen way high?
Well, lot people will say, oh, not much oxygen there. air thinner.
OK, well, perhaps better way think that, remember talking
mechanical aspects breathing fact lungs don't really move
themselves, muscles, diaphragm intercostal muscles
move them? Well, lot reason lungs can fill readily air
don't much air lungs, low air pressure lungs
relative outside you. mean open mouth
[INHALES] nose breathe in, is, breathe nose mouth,
going happen air going move high pressure low pressure.
easy fill lungs. Even though need muscles move various


things around allow lungs fill, air going go high pressure low
pressure. [INHALES] listening, just took big inhale
nose. exhale, basically taking lungs state
pressure really high lungs, high pressure, like balloon full--
pressure lungs lungs full higher air outside.
pretty easy [EXHALES] expel air nose mouth. high

actually put lot effort breathing air lungs. really
exert lot force. get diaphragm, intercostal muscles working

words, muscles got stronger, got efficient driving

important aside, believe, because, A, answers question lot people ask
lot people wonder and, B, incorporates mechanical
aspects breathing chemical aspects breathing. realize little bit
unusual circumstance. now anyone asks hard breathe altitude,
know lack high pressure low pressure gradient across
body atmosphere outside you. also opportunity say
find altitude headache feeling like just
can't catch breath, spending time really consciously trying draw larger

00:51:50 Brain Centers & Breathing Rhythm

already talked phrenic nerve, nerve innervates diaphragm
allows lungs fill movement diaphragm.
didn't talk about, however, brain centers actually control phrenic nerve
control breathing. Knowing two brain areas
extremely important, not just understanding content episode
understanding tools discuss and, indeed, general health


relates respiration. basically two areas brain control breathing.
first called pre-Botzinger complex. don't worry name
much. Just know named bottle wine discovered
great Jack Feldman, professor neuroscience University
California, Los Angeles. one fundamental discoveries
neuroscience last hundred years brain area Jack
colleagues discovered controls aspects breathing rhythmic, is,
inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. controlled small
set neurons brainstem area, around region neck, called pre-
Botzinger complex. really owe debt gratitude Jack colleagues
discovering area involved everything breathing
asleep breathing not thinking breathing. may role--
is, function disrupted, may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.
event, pre-Botzinger complex controlling inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale patterns
breathing. brain center controlling breathing, again, phrenic nerve-
- converges goes phrenic nerve intercostal muscles--
so-called parafacial nucleus. parafacial nucleus involved patterns
breathing not inhale followed exhale, inhale followed exhale--
is, not rhythmic, one other-- but, rather, doubling

inhales precede exhales precede inhales on, deliberate breath hold
inserted there. anytime taking conscious control breathing, parafacial
nucleus getting involved. Now, don't assume parafacial nucleus
way take conscious control breathing. can also take
control pre-Botzinger complex. can right now. instance,
breathing specific pattern now that, unless speaking eating, no doubt
going involve inhales followed exhales. could, instance, decide that,
yes, inhales active exhales passive. now going make
exhales active well. rather just inhale let lungs deflate,
inhale [INHALES] force air out. [EXHALES] going represent
conscious taking control pre-Botzinger complex. reason
giving mechanistic detail is, A, super important want understand
tools related breathing. B, actually pretty simple system. Even though areas
fancy names like pre-Botzinger parafacial, pretty straightforward.
one area controls rhythmic breathing-- inhale follows exhales-- area
gets involved breathing time start doubling inhales exhales.
fact, parafacial nucleus one relying speak order
make sure still get enough oxygen. also one will use
incorporate physiological sigh box breathing. And, frankly, time,
using circuits brain systems, parafacial pre-Botzinger,
parallel. Again, biology loves parallel systems, especially things critical
didn't them, die, like breathing. makes sense
two different brain structures control this. now understanding
mechanical control breathing, is, different parts within parts list

look detailed analyzes. However, takeaway paper exquisitely
simple also believe incredibly important. Basically, showed
people hyperventilate, expel, is, exhale carbon dioxide

low blood. short period time, become low tissues
body. carbon dioxide level drops low, say, OK, well, still
bringing lot oxygen, people hyperventilating.
feel really alert. And, indeed, happens. people feel alert. However,
not bringing enough carbon dioxide or, rather, proper way say
overbreathing, exhaling much, not retaining
keeping enough carbon dioxide. Well, lack carbon dioxide means
oxygen breathing can't liberated hemoglobin, can't get
brain. observe 30% 40% reduction amount oxygen
delivered brain. reduction carbon dioxide also prevents
normal patterns vasodilation, dilating, opening
capillaries, so, again, less blood flow. importantly, shown paper,
brain overall becomes hyperexcitable. starved oxygen blood
flow. neurons nonspecific way start increasing firing levels.
background activity getting louder louder. like rumble noise

touch event world doesn't get noise.
means hyperventilate, aren't retaining enough carbon
dioxide, not getting enough oxygen tissues need oxygen.
consequence that, brain becomes hyperexcitable. actually know
increase anxiety. become less good, less efficient detecting things
environment. not processing information well all. noise goes up,
signal goes down. Again, incredibly important set findings. also mention
hyperventilation one way that, laboratory anyway neurosurgery units
time, physicians evoke seizure seizure-prone patients. reason
works exactly explanation just gave you. Seizure excitability brain,
not enough inhibition suppression overall circuitry. get waves


storms electrical activity. Low levels carbon dioxide brain
low levels carbon dioxide blood one major triggers seizures. Now,
realize people listening not epileptic. nonetheless, brings
us back question normal healthy breathing. mentioned before,
normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath
minute passes? No. find correct pattern breathing going
involve two things. First all, nasal breathing, resistance provides
nose talked earlier, going deliver oxygen
system. going able generate air pressure fill lungs.
greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen
carbon dioxide proper ways, also taking pauses breaths.
extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.


01:09:44 Tool: Train Healthy Breathing, Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test & Box Breathing

next, like address can normal patterns breathing,
is, anyone can adjust normal patterns breathing unhealthy

01:22:39 Tool: Breathwork & Stress Reduction; Cyclic Sighing

restore normal patterns breathing not overbreathe therefore not eliminate
much carbon dioxide exactly two tests incorporated study
laboratory collaboration associate chair psychiatry Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. David Spiegel, also guest podcast
previously. study explored box breathing. also explored forms
breathing actually compared forms deliberate breathing meditation
means explore going minimal effective doses effective
ways chronically reduce stress around clock improve mood improve
sleep. study referring just published recently. entitled "Brief
Structured Respiration Practices Enhance Mood Reduce Physiological Arousal."
will also provide link paper show note captions. study really
focused simple question, is, shortest effective
practice people can use order reduce levels stress not just


breathwork practice meditation practice around clock, 24 hours day,
including improvements sleep? excited study many
studies explored meditation or, cases, fewer studies explored
breathwork can impact different brain states bodily states. studies
explored breathwork meditation practices influenced body-brain states
around clock people not performing particular meditation
breathwork practice. reason able study really fortunate.
folks WHOOP generous enough donate bunch WHOOP straps,
allowed us measure heart rate variability, number different
physiological parameters. also got subjective reports people's mood
feelings well-being. got data sleep pinged us remote locations.
people, rather brought laboratory artificial
circumstance, laboratory, much like think laboratory realistic--
virtual reality things like that-- nothing realistic real world.
able hundred subjects real world living
real lives pinging back us data time, 24 hours day measure
different interventions asked do, breathwork practices
meditation practices, impacting physiological parameters. also
informing us regularly subjective mood, et cetera. got lot data,
can imagine. basic takeaway study twofold. First all,
discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly
lead improvements focus memory, not much reductions stress, although
lead reductions stress. found number different
breathwork practices-- explored three-- done five minutes day outperformed
meditation terms ability breathwork reduce stress around clock
compared meditation. three types breathwork explored also showed
different effects. mention three types breathwork compared


box breathing sort just learned about. compare something
called cyclic sighing, involves two inhales nose get maximally
inflated lungs followed long exhale. return moment.
repeated five minutes time session. third breathwork practice,
cyclic hyperventilation, which, name suggests, involves people inhaling
deeply nose, exhaling passively mouth, repeating
inhale nose, exhale mouth, repeating 25 cycles, one
cycle inhale exhale. equals one cycle. Repeating 25
cycles, exhaling air holding breath lungs empty 15
30 seconds, repeating inhale, exhale, cyclic hyperventilation duration
five minutes. people divided different groups, either mindfulness
meditation sat, not told control breathing specific
way. closed eyes. focused attention region just behind
forehead. One group that. group cyclic sighing. Another group box
breathing. Another group cyclic hyperventilation. sort clinical trial like
to, swapped people different groups. served
control. evaluate within individual variability. Again,
lot data paper. takeaway sake stress reduction
around clock sake improving sleep mood, effective
practice four practices examined cyclic sighing. Again, cyclic
sighing performed following way. inhale nose deeply
can. second inhale immediately afterwards try maximally inflate
lungs. fact, happens. know second inhale, even
just sharp, short inhale, extra physical vigor required generate
second inhale causes alveoli lungs, may collapsed-- and,
indeed, breaths often even just course day
especially get stressed, alveoli lungs start collapse.
damp inside-- little bit fluid. like balloon
little bit fluid middle. takes little bit physical force pop open. Now,
not literally exploding pop. reinflating air.
perform long exhale mouth lungs empty. looks exactly like
this. [INHALES DEEPLY] [INHALES SHARPLY] [EXHALES] Now, know one
single physiological sigh sort just described performed time day
conditions, whether not walk stage give talk


meeting feeling stressed, conversation
stressful, can feel stress mounting traffic number
psychological physical stressors may approaching feel
oppressing you, one physiological sigh sort just described
fastest physiologically verified way aware reduce levels stress
reintroduce calm, is, shift autonomic nervous system state
heightened levels autonomic arousal. is, sympathetic nervous system as,
called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything
so-called fight flight, although controls things, too, including positive
arousal. parasympathetic nervous system, often referred rest
digest system, although things, too, associated calming. two
things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep
inhale, short second inhale also nose, long exhale completely
lungs empty, known restore level balance sympathetic-parasympathetic
neural circuitry fastest way reintroduce calm. one physiological sigh.
study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.
translated, again, sorts positive subjective changes-- improvements
sleep, lower resting heart rate times day. important. Again, study
not just exploring happens meditation breathwork, cyclic sighing, et
cetera. exploring changes occur practice translate
changes breathing heart rate, mood, et cetera, throughout 24-hour cycle.
takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress
reduction practice now supported data translate reductions stress
around clock, data say want invest cyclic sighing, is,
double inhale nose, extended exhale mouth lungs


empty, repeat five minutes day. You, course, like,
meditation. still positive effects, meaning reduced stress, although not much
cyclic sighing. box breathing want purpose reducing
stress. practices explored reduce stress. cyclic sighing performed
five minutes day robust pervasive effect reducing stress,
improving mood, improving sleep. first message study. second
takeaway one physiological sigh-- right just one physiological sigh,
inhale deeply nose another inhale nose maximally inflate
alveoli lungs, exhale completely lungs empty go
back normal breathing, fastest way introduce level calm reduce
overall levels stress real time. important. think
days, hear lot stress reduction techniques. stress
reduction techniques explored, everything massage meditation
breathwork hot shower foot rub, will calm down. question is,
calm just practice? Great does. also translate
reduced levels stress times 24-hour cycle positive effects
well? one physiological sigh efficient way adjust ratio sympathetic
parasympathetic activation immediately bring calm. excellent
real-time control stress. thing physiological sighs not

Heart rate variability involves vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve,
parasympathetic nerve associated calming aspect autonomic

Again, doesn't tend work lot time. people, works every time.
people, doesn't work all. However, technique can reliably
eliminate hiccups. technique takes advantage hypercontracting
phrenic nerve short period time subsequently relaxes
alleviates spasming phrenic nerve. simple method inhale three

focused breathing techniques emphasize exhale,

01:51:17 Tool: Stress Management & Cyclic Hyperventilation, “Wim Hof Method”

whether not carbon dioxide tolerance test, whether not cyclic sighing
physiological sigh use real time reduce stress. One thing
haven't talked much cyclic hyperventilation. Cyclic hyperventilation,
recall, bout 25 breaths inhaling deeply nose passively

Well, course, not going best approach. need exhale well
reasons now well aware of. findings really illustrate--
mention findings carried humans. relate

title paper "Nasal Respiration Entrains Human Limbic Oscillations
Modulates Cognitive Function." paper followed earlier paper
showed people breathe nose, recognition
discrimination different odors far greater breathe
mouth. Now, result interesting, also sort duh smell
things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal
inhalations versus nasal exhalations versus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.
basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal
noise talked earlier, recall, ability brain detect things
environment, increased inhalations. earlier study focused
smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate
variables. paper, one just mentioned, "Nasal Respiration Entrains
Human Limbic Oscillations Modulates Cognitive Function," not look
detection odors. Rather, looked things like reaction time fear. basically,
found reaction time greatly reduced people inhaling.
people look fearful stimuli. looked reaction time fearful stimuli,

basic takeaway people inhaling, is, drawing air
nose particular, ability detect going world
around greatly enhanced not just fear also surprise sorts.
people inhaling, ability detect novel stimuli, things unexpected

study well. find one interesting studies realm,
although now many additional studies support statement made

Now, one caveat think important know number
people listen podcast sake gleaning tools not just cognitive enhancement
physical enhancement. turns inhaling air, actually
less able or, say, less efficient generating voluntary movements. Now,
might come surprise. now, basically talking inhalation
great, almost point wonder like, exhalation good anything?
don't want overbreathe kick much carbon dioxide. Well, course
exhalation great things. fact, somebody played baseball

engage intercostal muscles. Whereas exhales tend passive unless
take active control exhale. And, indeed, ability generate fast, directed, so-


called volitional, voluntary movements greatly enhanced
exhale, not inhale. Now, said, haven't yet really talked mouth
versus nasal breathing.

00:31:23 Chemistry Breathing, Hyperventilation



now talk chemical aspects breathing. two major players
discussion oxygen, cells tissues body need, carbon
dioxide, cells tissues body need. fact, carbon dioxide plays
critical roles delivering oxygen cells. without carbon dioxide, not
going get enough oxygen cells tissues body. said, carbon
dioxide levels high, problematic. fact, one ways one can
reliably induce panic anybody breathe air contains much
carbon dioxide, much people lack so-called amygdala-- many
probably heard amygdala. brain area associated fear
threat detection. Even people completely lack amygdalas sides
brain removed epileptic seizures and,
therefore, people completely unafraid things afraid
like heights, poisonous snakes, number different things dangerous humans,
well, people breathe excess amount carbon dioxide, immediately
panic attack. tells us that, again, parallel mechanisms,

not much. way accomplished is, course, breathe air. lungs

chemical components breathing. aspects related
chemical components breathing, fact carbon dioxide strongly

gut, want pH sometimes slightly acidic. acidic,
little microbiota flourish far basic. basically, want
rest body pH 7.4. carbon dioxide levels go low, pH
increases way might say, oh, well, bad, actually allows
oxygen available tissues body, least temporarily. talk
bit later. losing you, just hang almost
done whole business mechanics chemistry breathing,
can get tools revisit later clean misunderstandings
may arisen. talking carbon dioxide
key carbon dioxide problems going high low,
probably asking yourself, actually makes carbon dioxide go low?
know breathe oxygen, can pass lungs alveoli
bloodstream need carbon dioxide liberate oxygen
hemoglobin cells tissues body. know exhale--
well, actually, haven't told yet. know exhale,
carbon dioxide actually taken bloodstream back alveoli lungs.
exhale, expelled mouth nose
world. way just described that-- inhale, bring oxygen, exhale, expel
carbon dioxide-- pretty straightforward, right? Indeed, is. also tells
exhale lot lot vigorously, expel carbon dioxide.


fact, exactly way works. hyperventilate, course,
inhaling usual, also exhaling usual. you're,
course, bringing air oxygen body. also removing

Well, carbon dioxide actually vasodilator. Normally, exists body

hyperventilate, sure, bringing lot oxygen, think make

will also notice feeling alert brain might start feel

00:40:35 High Altitudes, Oxygen & Breathing

will explain adjust ratios oxygen carbon dioxide depending
immediate needs plan next, whether not sleep
exercise mental work, et cetera. going further, however,
something want touch on. even though not everyone will experience this,
think enough people experience interest, now's right time touch
happens go high altitude, meaning hard
breathe get high altitudes. close sea level, getting
optimal balance oxygen air breathe. ascend altitude--
say go 6,000 feet 10,000 maybe even 11,000 feet sea level.
maybe one rare individuals climbs Denali, climb Mount
Everest, get there, notice people going wear
oxygen mask. need oxygen mask high altitudes
people high altitude skydives need oxygen way high?
Well, lot people will say, oh, not much oxygen there. air thinner.
OK, well, perhaps better way think that, remember talking
mechanical aspects breathing fact lungs don't really move
themselves, muscles, diaphragm intercostal muscles
move them? Well, lot reason lungs can fill readily air
don't much air lungs, low air pressure lungs
relative outside you. mean open mouth
[INHALES] nose breathe in, is, breathe nose mouth,
going happen air going move high pressure low pressure.
easy fill lungs. Even though need muscles move various


things around allow lungs fill, air going go high pressure low
pressure. [INHALES] listening, just took big inhale
nose. exhale, basically taking lungs state
pressure really high lungs, high pressure, like balloon full--
pressure lungs lungs full higher air outside.
pretty easy [EXHALES] expel air nose mouth. high
altitudes, air pressure lower. happens air pressure
lower outside body lungs not full air, don't really steep
gradient high pressure outside body low pressure inside lungs.
actually put lot effort breathing air lungs. really
exert lot force. get diaphragm, intercostal muscles working
really hard. might even find shoulders lifting breath
[INHALES] really generate lot force get enough air
oxygen lungs. Now, important principle understand humans,
species, really talking now humans,
inhale, active process. really need use muscles intercostals
diaphragm order inflate lungs. whole process made easier
air pressure outside body higher lungs
going fill really readily. Exhaling, least humans, passive thing.
just relax diaphragm relax intercostals let rib cage kind
fall back original position. inhaling active, exhaling passive.
happens high altitude air pressure low,
put lot energy breathing air lungs get equivalent amount
oxygen lungs bloodstream. arrive
high altitude location, first days, going feel lightheaded maybe
headache. also going buildup carbon dioxide system.
whole balance oxygen carbon dioxide going disrupted. mention
because, yes, indeed, changes atmospheric gases high
altitudes, can impact much oxygen can bring system,
tissues. heard many explanations hard breathe
feel lousy altitude. Well, just discovered one reason, don't
steep high pressure low pressure gradient outside body
inside body. converse also true. altitude days
opportunity adjust-- lot athletes, instance, will go train


altitude. hard first days weeks, get really good
training altitude. number different adaptations occur terms
amount oxygen can carried blood hemoglobin interactions
carbon dioxide hemoglobin oxygen allow oxygen

move quickly altitude-- say, training 8,000 feet 10,000
feet. hiking high level, adapted, come

going able essentially deliver far oxygen muscles per
breath. part, way hemoglobin oxygen

high altitude, intercostal muscles diaphragms got
trained quite bit allowed generate air volume every breath.
words, muscles got stronger, got efficient driving
phrenic nerve consciously [INHALES] really breathe lot oxygen don't
feel lightheaded, headache, et cetera. OK, little bit aside.
important aside, believe, because, A, answers question lot people ask
lot people wonder and, B, incorporates mechanical
aspects breathing chemical aspects breathing. realize little bit
unusual circumstance. now anyone asks hard breathe altitude,
know lack high pressure low pressure gradient across
body atmosphere outside you. also opportunity say
find altitude headache feeling like just
can't catch breath, spending time really consciously trying draw larger
breaths air, much might seem fatiguing short breath, will
allow adapt quickly. little bit later episode, touch
methods, including deliberate hyperventilation combined breath holds,
can allow deliver oxygen cells immediately upon arriving altitude
don't get quite much headache, disorientation, on. leaving breathing
altitude aside come back conceptual level.

California, Los Angeles. one fundamental discoveries
neuroscience last hundred years brain area Jack
colleagues discovered controls aspects breathing rhythmic, is,
inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. controlled small
set neurons brainstem area, around region neck, called pre-
Botzinger complex. really owe debt gratitude Jack colleagues
discovering area involved everything breathing
asleep breathing not thinking breathing. may role--
is, function disrupted, may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.

feel really alert. And, indeed, happens. people feel alert. However,
not bringing enough carbon dioxide or, rather, proper way say
overbreathing, exhaling much, not retaining
keeping enough carbon dioxide. Well, lack carbon dioxide means
oxygen breathing can't liberated hemoglobin, can't get

us back question normal healthy breathing. mentioned before,
normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath

greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen

extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.

discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly

nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal

now talk chemical aspects breathing. two major players
discussion oxygen, cells tissues body need, carbon

critical roles delivering oxygen cells. without carbon dioxide, not
going get enough oxygen cells tissues body. said, carbon

bit later. losing you, just hang almost
done whole business mechanics chemistry breathing,
can get tools revisit later clean misunderstandings
may arisen. talking carbon dioxide
key carbon dioxide problems going high low,
probably asking yourself, actually makes carbon dioxide go low?
know breathe oxygen, can pass lungs alveoli

well, actually, haven't told yet. know exhale,

00:40:35 High Altitudes, Oxygen & Breathing

will explain adjust ratios oxygen carbon dioxide depending
immediate needs plan next, whether not sleep
exercise mental work, et cetera. going further, however,
something want touch on. even though not everyone will experience this,
think enough people experience interest, now's right time touch
happens go high altitude, meaning hard
breathe get high altitudes. close sea level, getting
optimal balance oxygen air breathe. ascend altitude--
say go 6,000 feet 10,000 maybe even 11,000 feet sea level.
maybe one rare individuals climbs Denali, climb Mount
Everest, get there, notice people going wear
oxygen mask. need oxygen mask high altitudes
people high altitude skydives need oxygen way high?
Well, lot people will say, oh, not much oxygen there. air thinner.
OK, well, perhaps better way think that, remember talking
mechanical aspects breathing fact lungs don't really move
themselves, muscles, diaphragm intercostal muscles
move them? Well, lot reason lungs can fill readily air
don't much air lungs, low air pressure lungs
relative outside you. mean open mouth
[INHALES] nose breathe in, is, breathe nose mouth,
going happen air going move high pressure low pressure.
easy fill lungs. Even though need muscles move various


things around allow lungs fill, air going go high pressure low
pressure. [INHALES] listening, just took big inhale
nose. exhale, basically taking lungs state
pressure really high lungs, high pressure, like balloon full--
pressure lungs lungs full higher air outside.
pretty easy [EXHALES] expel air nose mouth. high
altitudes, air pressure lower. happens air pressure
lower outside body lungs not full air, don't really steep

actually put lot effort breathing air lungs. really
exert lot force. get diaphragm, intercostal muscles working

[INHALES] really generate lot force get enough air
oxygen lungs. Now, important principle understand humans,
species, really talking now humans,
inhale, active process. really need use muscles intercostals
diaphragm order inflate lungs. whole process made easier
air pressure outside body higher lungs
going fill really readily. Exhaling, least humans, passive thing.
just relax diaphragm relax intercostals let rib cage kind

happens high altitude air pressure low,
put lot energy breathing air lungs get equivalent amount

whole balance oxygen carbon dioxide going disrupted. mention
because, yes, indeed, changes atmospheric gases high

feel lousy altitude. Well, just discovered one reason, don't
steep high pressure low pressure gradient outside body
inside body. converse also true. altitude days
opportunity adjust-- lot athletes, instance, will go train


altitude. hard first days weeks, get really good
training altitude. number different adaptations occur terms

move quickly altitude-- say, training 8,000 feet 10,000
feet. hiking high level, adapted, come

going able essentially deliver far oxygen muscles per

high altitude, intercostal muscles diaphragms got
trained quite bit allowed generate air volume every breath.
words, muscles got stronger, got efficient driving
phrenic nerve consciously [INHALES] really breathe lot oxygen don't
feel lightheaded, headache, et cetera. OK, little bit aside.
important aside, believe, because, A, answers question lot people ask
lot people wonder and, B, incorporates mechanical
aspects breathing chemical aspects breathing. realize little bit
unusual circumstance. now anyone asks hard breathe altitude,
know lack high pressure low pressure gradient across
body atmosphere outside you. also opportunity say
find altitude headache feeling like just
can't catch breath, spending time really consciously trying draw larger
breaths air, much might seem fatiguing short breath, will
allow adapt quickly. little bit later episode, touch
methods, including deliberate hyperventilation combined breath holds,
can allow deliver oxygen cells immediately upon arriving altitude
don't get quite much headache, disorientation, on. leaving breathing
altitude aside come back conceptual level.

00:51:50 Brain Centers & Breathing Rhythm

already talked phrenic nerve, nerve innervates diaphragm
allows lungs fill movement diaphragm.
didn't talk about, however, brain centers actually control phrenic nerve
control breathing. Knowing two brain areas
extremely important, not just understanding content episode
understanding tools discuss and, indeed, general health


relates respiration. basically two areas brain control breathing.
first called pre-Botzinger complex. don't worry name
much. Just know named bottle wine discovered
great Jack Feldman, professor neuroscience University
California, Los Angeles. one fundamental discoveries
neuroscience last hundred years brain area Jack
colleagues discovered controls aspects breathing rhythmic, is,
inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. controlled small
set neurons brainstem area, around region neck, called pre-
Botzinger complex. really owe debt gratitude Jack colleagues
discovering area involved everything breathing
asleep breathing not thinking breathing. may role--
is, function disrupted, may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.
event, pre-Botzinger complex controlling inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale patterns
breathing. brain center controlling breathing, again, phrenic nerve-
- converges goes phrenic nerve intercostal muscles--
so-called parafacial nucleus. parafacial nucleus involved patterns
breathing not inhale followed exhale, inhale followed exhale--
is, not rhythmic, one other-- but, rather, doubling
inhales doubling exhales deliberate pause breathing, inhale, pause,


exhale, pause, inhale, pause, exhale, pause, sort thing. little bit later, talk
pattern breathing called box breathing, specific useful
applications, particular adjusting anxiety. case, involves going

inhales precede exhales precede inhales on, deliberate breath hold
inserted there. anytime taking conscious control breathing, parafacial
nucleus getting involved. Now, don't assume parafacial nucleus
way take conscious control breathing. can also take
control pre-Botzinger complex. can right now. instance,
breathing specific pattern now that, unless speaking eating, no doubt
going involve inhales followed exhales. could, instance, decide that,
yes, inhales active exhales passive. now going make
exhales active well. rather just inhale let lungs deflate,
inhale [INHALES] force air out. [EXHALES] going represent
conscious taking control pre-Botzinger complex. reason
giving mechanistic detail is, A, super important want understand
tools related breathing. B, actually pretty simple system. Even though areas
fancy names like pre-Botzinger parafacial, pretty straightforward.
one area controls rhythmic breathing-- inhale follows exhales-- area
gets involved breathing time start doubling inhales exhales.
fact, parafacial nucleus one relying speak order
make sure still get enough oxygen. also one will use
incorporate physiological sigh box breathing. And, frankly, time,
using circuits brain systems, parafacial pre-Botzinger,

two different brain structures control this. now understanding

feel really alert. And, indeed, happens. people feel alert. However,
not bringing enough carbon dioxide or, rather, proper way say
overbreathing, exhaling much, not retaining
keeping enough carbon dioxide. Well, lack carbon dioxide means
oxygen breathing can't liberated hemoglobin, can't get

us back question normal healthy breathing. mentioned before,
normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath

involve two things. First all, nasal breathing, resistance provides
nose talked earlier, going deliver oxygen
system. going able generate air pressure fill lungs.
greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen
carbon dioxide proper ways, also taking pauses breaths.
extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.

can imagine. basic takeaway study twofold. First all,
discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly

things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep

showed people breathe nose, recognition

things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal
inhalations versus nasal exhalations versus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.
basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal
noise talked earlier, recall, ability brain detect things
environment, increased inhalations. earlier study focused
smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate

called volitional, voluntary movements greatly enhanced
exhale, not inhale. Now, said, haven't yet really talked mouth

00:31:23 Chemistry Breathing, Hyperventilation



now talk chemical aspects breathing. two major players
discussion oxygen, cells tissues body need, carbon
dioxide, cells tissues body need. fact, carbon dioxide plays
critical roles delivering oxygen cells. without carbon dioxide, not
going get enough oxygen cells tissues body. said, carbon
dioxide levels high, problematic. fact, one ways one can
reliably induce panic anybody breathe air contains much
carbon dioxide, much people lack so-called amygdala-- many

therefore, people completely unafraid things afraid

gut, want pH sometimes slightly acidic. acidic,
little microbiota flourish far basic. basically, want
rest body pH 7.4. carbon dioxide levels go low, pH
increases way might say, oh, well, bad, actually allows
oxygen available tissues body, least temporarily. talk
bit later. losing you, just hang almost
done whole business mechanics chemistry breathing,
can get tools revisit later clean misunderstandings
may arisen. talking carbon dioxide
key carbon dioxide problems going high low,
probably asking yourself, actually makes carbon dioxide go low?
know breathe oxygen, can pass lungs alveoli
bloodstream need carbon dioxide liberate oxygen
hemoglobin cells tissues body. know exhale--
well, actually, haven't told yet. know exhale,
carbon dioxide actually taken bloodstream back alveoli lungs.
exhale, expelled mouth nose
world. way just described that-- inhale, bring oxygen, exhale, expel
carbon dioxide-- pretty straightforward, right? Indeed, is. also tells
exhale lot lot vigorously, expel carbon dioxide.


fact, exactly way works. hyperventilate, course,

course, bringing air oxygen body. also removing

Well, carbon dioxide actually vasodilator. Normally, exists body

something want touch on. even though not everyone will experience this,
think enough people experience interest, now's right time touch
happens go high altitude, meaning hard
breathe get high altitudes. close sea level, getting
optimal balance oxygen air breathe. ascend altitude--
say go 6,000 feet 10,000 maybe even 11,000 feet sea level.
maybe one rare individuals climbs Denali, climb Mount

people high altitude skydives need oxygen way high?
Well, lot people will say, oh, not much oxygen there. air thinner.
OK, well, perhaps better way think that, remember talking
mechanical aspects breathing fact lungs don't really move
themselves, muscles, diaphragm intercostal muscles
move them? Well, lot reason lungs can fill readily air

00:51:50 Brain Centers & Breathing Rhythm

already talked phrenic nerve, nerve innervates diaphragm
allows lungs fill movement diaphragm.
didn't talk about, however, brain centers actually control phrenic nerve
control breathing. Knowing two brain areas
extremely important, not just understanding content episode
understanding tools discuss and, indeed, general health


relates respiration. basically two areas brain control breathing.
first called pre-Botzinger complex. don't worry name
much. Just know named bottle wine discovered
great Jack Feldman, professor neuroscience University
California, Los Angeles. one fundamental discoveries
neuroscience last hundred years brain area Jack
colleagues discovered controls aspects breathing rhythmic, is,
inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. controlled small
set neurons brainstem area, around region neck, called pre-
Botzinger complex. really owe debt gratitude Jack colleagues
discovering area involved everything breathing
asleep breathing not thinking breathing. may role--
is, function disrupted, may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.
event, pre-Botzinger complex controlling inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale patterns
breathing. brain center controlling breathing, again, phrenic nerve-
- converges goes phrenic nerve intercostal muscles--
so-called parafacial nucleus. parafacial nucleus involved patterns
breathing not inhale followed exhale, inhale followed exhale--
is, not rhythmic, one other-- but, rather, doubling
inhales doubling exhales deliberate pause breathing, inhale, pause,


exhale, pause, inhale, pause, exhale, pause, sort thing. little bit later, talk
pattern breathing called box breathing, specific useful
applications, particular adjusting anxiety. case, involves going

give away probably already obvious, inhale, hold, exhale, hold,
repeat. pattern breathing, even though rhythmic nature
inhales precede exhales precede inhales on, deliberate breath hold
inserted there. anytime taking conscious control breathing, parafacial
nucleus getting involved. Now, don't assume parafacial nucleus
way take conscious control breathing. can also take
control pre-Botzinger complex. can right now. instance,
breathing specific pattern now that, unless speaking eating, no doubt
going involve inhales followed exhales. could, instance, decide that,
yes, inhales active exhales passive. now going make
exhales active well. rather just inhale let lungs deflate,
inhale [INHALES] force air out. [EXHALES] going represent
conscious taking control pre-Botzinger complex. reason
giving mechanistic detail is, A, super important want understand
tools related breathing. B, actually pretty simple system. Even though areas
fancy names like pre-Botzinger parafacial, pretty straightforward.
one area controls rhythmic breathing-- inhale follows exhales-- area
gets involved breathing time start doubling inhales exhales.
fact, parafacial nucleus one relying speak order
make sure still get enough oxygen. also one will use
incorporate physiological sigh box breathing. And, frankly, time,
using circuits brain systems, parafacial pre-Botzinger,

two different brain structures control this. now understanding

bringing lot oxygen, people hyperventilating.
feel really alert. And, indeed, happens. people feel alert. However,
not bringing enough carbon dioxide or, rather, proper way say
overbreathing, exhaling much, not retaining
keeping enough carbon dioxide. Well, lack carbon dioxide means
oxygen breathing can't liberated hemoglobin, can't get

us back question normal healthy breathing. mentioned before,
normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath
minute passes? No. find correct pattern breathing going
involve two things. First all, nasal breathing, resistance provides
nose talked earlier, going deliver oxygen
system. going able generate air pressure fill lungs.
greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen
carbon dioxide proper ways, also taking pauses breaths.
extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.

discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly

called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything
so-called fight flight, although controls things, too, including positive
arousal. parasympathetic nervous system, often referred rest

things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep
inhale, short second inhale also nose, long exhale completely
lungs empty, known restore level balance sympathetic-parasympathetic
neural circuitry fastest way reintroduce calm. one physiological sigh.
study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.

takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress
reduction practice now supported data translate reductions stress

takeaway one physiological sigh-- right just one physiological sigh,

called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, basis call heart rate variability.
Heart rate variability involves vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve,

title paper "Nasal Respiration Entrains Human Limbic Oscillations

showed people breathe nose, recognition

things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal
inhalations versus nasal exhalations versus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.
basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal
noise talked earlier, recall, ability brain detect things
environment, increased inhalations. earlier study focused
smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate

called volitional, voluntary movements greatly enhanced
exhale, not inhale. Now, said, haven't yet really talked mouth

now talk chemical aspects breathing. two major players
discussion oxygen, cells tissues body need, carbon

critical roles delivering oxygen cells. without carbon dioxide, not
going get enough oxygen cells tissues body. said, carbon

bit later. losing you, just hang almost
done whole business mechanics chemistry breathing,
can get tools revisit later clean misunderstandings
may arisen. talking carbon dioxide
key carbon dioxide problems going high low,
probably asking yourself, actually makes carbon dioxide go low?
know breathe oxygen, can pass lungs alveoli

well, actually, haven't told yet. know exhale,
carbon dioxide actually taken bloodstream back alveoli lungs.
exhale, expelled mouth nose

exhale lot lot vigorously, expel carbon dioxide.


fact, exactly way works. hyperventilate, course,

Well, carbon dioxide actually vasodilator. Normally, exists body

will explain adjust ratios oxygen carbon dioxide depending
immediate needs plan next, whether not sleep

something want touch on. even though not everyone will experience this,
think enough people experience interest, now's right time touch
happens go high altitude, meaning hard
breathe get high altitudes. close sea level, getting
optimal balance oxygen air breathe. ascend altitude--
say go 6,000 feet 10,000 maybe even 11,000 feet sea level.
maybe one rare individuals climbs Denali, climb Mount
Everest, get there, notice people going wear
oxygen mask. need oxygen mask high altitudes
people high altitude skydives need oxygen way high?
Well, lot people will say, oh, not much oxygen there. air thinner.
OK, well, perhaps better way think that, remember talking
mechanical aspects breathing fact lungs don't really move
themselves, muscles, diaphragm intercostal muscles
move them? Well, lot reason lungs can fill readily air
don't much air lungs, low air pressure lungs
relative outside you. mean open mouth
[INHALES] nose breathe in, is, breathe nose mouth,
going happen air going move high pressure low pressure.
easy fill lungs. Even though need muscles move various


things around allow lungs fill, air going go high pressure low

nose. exhale, basically taking lungs state
pressure really high lungs, high pressure, like balloon full--
pressure lungs lungs full higher air outside.
pretty easy [EXHALES] expel air nose mouth. high
altitudes, air pressure lower. happens air pressure
lower outside body lungs not full air, don't really steep

actually put lot effort breathing air lungs. really
exert lot force. get diaphragm, intercostal muscles working

00:51:50 Brain Centers & Breathing Rhythm

already talked phrenic nerve, nerve innervates diaphragm
allows lungs fill movement diaphragm.
didn't talk about, however, brain centers actually control phrenic nerve
control breathing. Knowing two brain areas
extremely important, not just understanding content episode
understanding tools discuss and, indeed, general health


relates respiration. basically two areas brain control breathing.
first called pre-Botzinger complex. don't worry name
much. Just know named bottle wine discovered
great Jack Feldman, professor neuroscience University
California, Los Angeles. one fundamental discoveries
neuroscience last hundred years brain area Jack
colleagues discovered controls aspects breathing rhythmic, is,
inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. controlled small
set neurons brainstem area, around region neck, called pre-
Botzinger complex. really owe debt gratitude Jack colleagues
discovering area involved everything breathing
asleep breathing not thinking breathing. may role--
is, function disrupted, may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.
event, pre-Botzinger complex controlling inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale patterns
breathing. brain center controlling breathing, again, phrenic nerve-
- converges goes phrenic nerve intercostal muscles--
so-called parafacial nucleus. parafacial nucleus involved patterns
breathing not inhale followed exhale, inhale followed exhale--
is, not rhythmic, one other-- but, rather, doubling
inhales doubling exhales deliberate pause breathing, inhale, pause,


exhale, pause, inhale, pause, exhale, pause, sort thing. little bit later, talk
pattern breathing called box breathing, specific useful
applications, particular adjusting anxiety. case, involves going

complex neurons, reliance parafacial nucleus neurons box breathing, just
give away probably already obvious, inhale, hold, exhale, hold,
repeat. pattern breathing, even though rhythmic nature
inhales precede exhales precede inhales on, deliberate breath hold
inserted there. anytime taking conscious control breathing, parafacial
nucleus getting involved. Now, don't assume parafacial nucleus
way take conscious control breathing. can also take
control pre-Botzinger complex. can right now. instance,
breathing specific pattern now that, unless speaking eating, no doubt
going involve inhales followed exhales. could, instance, decide that,
yes, inhales active exhales passive. now going make
exhales active well. rather just inhale let lungs deflate,
inhale [INHALES] force air out. [EXHALES] going represent
conscious taking control pre-Botzinger complex. reason
giving mechanistic detail is, A, super important want understand
tools related breathing. B, actually pretty simple system. Even though areas
fancy names like pre-Botzinger parafacial, pretty straightforward.
one area controls rhythmic breathing-- inhale follows exhales-- area
gets involved breathing time start doubling inhales exhales.
fact, parafacial nucleus one relying speak order
make sure still get enough oxygen. also one will use
incorporate physiological sigh box breathing. And, frankly, time,
using circuits brain systems, parafacial pre-Botzinger,

two different brain structures control this. now understanding

bringing lot oxygen, people hyperventilating.
feel really alert. And, indeed, happens. people feel alert. However,
not bringing enough carbon dioxide or, rather, proper way say
overbreathing, exhaling much, not retaining
keeping enough carbon dioxide. Well, lack carbon dioxide means
oxygen breathing can't liberated hemoglobin, can't get

us back question normal healthy breathing. mentioned before,
normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath

involve two things. First all, nasal breathing, resistance provides
nose talked earlier, going deliver oxygen
system. going able generate air pressure fill lungs.
greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen
carbon dioxide proper ways, also taking pauses breaths.
extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.

discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly

called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything
so-called fight flight, although controls things, too, including positive
arousal. parasympathetic nervous system, often referred rest

things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep
inhale, short second inhale also nose, long exhale completely
lungs empty, known restore level balance sympathetic-parasympathetic
neural circuitry fastest way reintroduce calm. one physiological sigh.
study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.

takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress
reduction practice now supported data translate reductions stress

takeaway one physiological sigh-- right just one physiological sigh,

showed people breathe nose, recognition

things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal

smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate

called volitional, voluntary movements greatly enhanced
exhale, not inhale. Now, said, haven't yet really talked mouth

something want touch on. even though not everyone will experience this,
think enough people experience interest, now's right time touch
happens go high altitude, meaning hard
breathe get high altitudes. close sea level, getting
optimal balance oxygen air breathe. ascend altitude--
say go 6,000 feet 10,000 maybe even 11,000 feet sea level.
maybe one rare individuals climbs Denali, climb Mount
Everest, get there, notice people going wear
oxygen mask. need oxygen mask high altitudes
people high altitude skydives need oxygen way high?
Well, lot people will say, oh, not much oxygen there. air thinner.
OK, well, perhaps better way think that, remember talking
mechanical aspects breathing fact lungs don't really move
themselves, muscles, diaphragm intercostal muscles
move them? Well, lot reason lungs can fill readily air
don't much air lungs, low air pressure lungs
relative outside you. mean open mouth
[INHALES] nose breathe in, is, breathe nose mouth,
going happen air going move high pressure low pressure.
easy fill lungs. Even though need muscles move various


things around allow lungs fill, air going go high pressure low

00:51:50 Brain Centers & Breathing Rhythm

already talked phrenic nerve, nerve innervates diaphragm
allows lungs fill movement diaphragm.
didn't talk about, however, brain centers actually control phrenic nerve
control breathing. Knowing two brain areas
extremely important, not just understanding content episode
understanding tools discuss and, indeed, general health


relates respiration. basically two areas brain control breathing.
first called pre-Botzinger complex. don't worry name
much. Just know named bottle wine discovered
great Jack Feldman, professor neuroscience University
California, Los Angeles. one fundamental discoveries
neuroscience last hundred years brain area Jack
colleagues discovered controls aspects breathing rhythmic, is,
inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. controlled small
set neurons brainstem area, around region neck, called pre-
Botzinger complex. really owe debt gratitude Jack colleagues
discovering area involved everything breathing
asleep breathing not thinking breathing. may role--
is, function disrupted, may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.
event, pre-Botzinger complex controlling inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale patterns

so-called parafacial nucleus. parafacial nucleus involved patterns

breathing specific pattern now that, unless speaking eating, no doubt
going involve inhales followed exhales. could, instance, decide that,
yes, inhales active exhales passive. now going make
exhales active well. rather just inhale let lungs deflate,
inhale [INHALES] force air out. [EXHALES] going represent
conscious taking control pre-Botzinger complex. reason
giving mechanistic detail is, A, super important want understand
tools related breathing. B, actually pretty simple system. Even though areas
fancy names like pre-Botzinger parafacial, pretty straightforward.
one area controls rhythmic breathing-- inhale follows exhales-- area

fact, parafacial nucleus one relying speak order
make sure still get enough oxygen. also one will use
incorporate physiological sigh box breathing. And, frankly, time,
using circuits brain systems, parafacial pre-Botzinger,

feel really alert. And, indeed, happens. people feel alert. However,
not bringing enough carbon dioxide or, rather, proper way say
overbreathing, exhaling much, not retaining
keeping enough carbon dioxide. Well, lack carbon dioxide means
oxygen breathing can't liberated hemoglobin, can't get

normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath

greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen

extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.

discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,

research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly

nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal

something want touch on. even though not everyone will experience this,
think enough people experience interest, now's right time touch
happens go high altitude, meaning hard
breathe get high altitudes. close sea level, getting

say go 6,000 feet 10,000 maybe even 11,000 feet sea level.
maybe one rare individuals climbs Denali, climb Mount

people high altitude skydives need oxygen way high?
Well, lot people will say, oh, not much oxygen there. air thinner.
OK, well, perhaps better way think that, remember talking
mechanical aspects breathing fact lungs don't really move
themselves, muscles, diaphragm intercostal muscles
move them? Well, lot reason lungs can fill readily air
don't much air lungs, low air pressure lungs

shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.
event, pre-Botzinger complex controlling inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale patterns

so-called parafacial nucleus. parafacial nucleus involved patterns
breathing not inhale followed exhale, inhale followed exhale--
is, not rhythmic, one other-- but, rather, doubling

exhale, pause, inhale, pause, exhale, pause, sort thing. little bit later, talk
pattern breathing called box breathing, specific useful
applications, particular adjusting anxiety. case, involves going
rhythmic breathing inhale, inhale, inhale, exhale, is, relying pre-Botzinger
complex neurons, reliance parafacial nucleus neurons box breathing, just
give away probably already obvious, inhale, hold, exhale, hold,
repeat. pattern breathing, even though rhythmic nature
inhales precede exhales precede inhales on, deliberate breath hold
inserted there. anytime taking conscious control breathing, parafacial
nucleus getting involved. Now, don't assume parafacial nucleus
way take conscious control breathing. can also take
control pre-Botzinger complex. can right now. instance,
breathing specific pattern now that, unless speaking eating, no doubt
going involve inhales followed exhales. could, instance, decide that,
yes, inhales active exhales passive. now going make
exhales active well. rather just inhale let lungs deflate,
inhale [INHALES] force air out. [EXHALES] going represent
conscious taking control pre-Botzinger complex. reason
giving mechanistic detail is, A, super important want understand
tools related breathing. B, actually pretty simple system. Even though areas
fancy names like pre-Botzinger parafacial, pretty straightforward.
one area controls rhythmic breathing-- inhale follows exhales-- area
gets involved breathing time start doubling inhales exhales.
fact, parafacial nucleus one relying speak order
make sure still get enough oxygen. also one will use
incorporate physiological sigh box breathing. And, frankly, time,
using circuits brain systems, parafacial pre-Botzinger,

everything nose mouth alveoli, lungs, et cetera, muscles involved
moving lungs. understand, like think, bit bringing oxygen
removing carbon dioxide not much carbon dioxide can't actually use
oxygen have. know two brain centers, one controlling rhythmic
breathing one controls nonrhythmic breathing. want repeat something
said little bit earlier well, breathing incredible represents
interface conscious subconscious control not just body, not
just lungs, breathe influences brain state. using
brain consciously control breathing, using brain control
brain. best way ever heard described beautiful, say now
classic paper Journal Physiology, published 1988 Balestrino
Somjen, final line summary intro states, "The brain, regulating
breathing, controls excitability." just remind don't
remember excitability is, excitability threshold given neuron, nerve
cell can active not. breathe certain way, neurons brain
likely get engaged. likely active. breathe
ways, brain becomes harder activate. excitability reduced. Now,
might think excitability great thing. always want brain excitable.
actually not case. And, fact, statement Balestrino Somjen
made led number investigations really important defining
people overbreathe, is, hyperventilate, rest, expel, is, exhale
much carbon dioxide, classic paper Balestrino Somjen led
number different investigations humans looking different patterns
breathing impact overall state brain ability brain respond
certain called sensory stimuli. Keep mind brain always active.
neurons firing low level, low level, low level. see something
hear something, want focus something, want exercise really
listen something learn, certain circuits brain need active
everything else. is, needs really high called signal noise.
always lot noise chatter background, just like chatter
cocktail party stadium event. order really pay attention, focus, learn,
incredible things brain can do, need signal get noise.
beautiful paper asks, pattern breathing, particular,


overbreathing, change patterns activity brain? paper entitled
"Effects Voluntary Hyperventilation Cortical Sensory Responses." will provide
link study show note captions. somewhat complicated paper
look detailed analyzes. However, takeaway paper exquisitely
simple also believe incredibly important. Basically, showed
people hyperventilate, expel, is, exhale carbon dioxide
normally. become called hypocapnic, OK? Carbon dioxide levels
low blood. short period time, become low tissues
body. carbon dioxide level drops low, say, OK, well, still
bringing lot oxygen, people hyperventilating.
feel really alert. And, indeed, happens. people feel alert. However,
not bringing enough carbon dioxide or, rather, proper way say
overbreathing, exhaling much, not retaining
keeping enough carbon dioxide. Well, lack carbon dioxide means
oxygen breathing can't liberated hemoglobin, can't get
brain. observe 30% 40% reduction amount oxygen
delivered brain. reduction carbon dioxide also prevents
normal patterns vasodilation, dilating, opening
capillaries, so, again, less blood flow. importantly, shown paper,
brain overall becomes hyperexcitable. starved oxygen blood
flow. neurons nonspecific way start increasing firing levels.
background activity getting louder louder. like rumble noise

touch event world doesn't get noise.
means hyperventilate, aren't retaining enough carbon
dioxide, not getting enough oxygen tissues need oxygen.
consequence that, brain becomes hyperexcitable. actually know
increase anxiety. become less good, less efficient detecting things
environment. not processing information well all. noise goes up,
signal goes down. Again, incredibly important set findings. also mention
hyperventilation one way that, laboratory anyway neurosurgery units
time, physicians evoke seizure seizure-prone patients. reason
works exactly explanation just gave you. Seizure excitability brain,
not enough inhibition suppression overall circuitry. get waves


storms electrical activity. Low levels carbon dioxide brain
low levels carbon dioxide blood one major triggers seizures. Now,
realize people listening not epileptic. nonetheless, brings
us back question normal healthy breathing. mentioned before,
normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath
minute passes? No. find correct pattern breathing going
involve two things. First all, nasal breathing, resistance provides
nose talked earlier, going deliver oxygen
system. going able generate air pressure fill lungs.
greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen
carbon dioxide proper ways, also taking pauses breaths.
extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.

01:22:39 Tool: Breathwork & Stress Reduction; Cyclic Sighing

restore normal patterns breathing not overbreathe therefore not eliminate
much carbon dioxide exactly two tests incorporated study
laboratory collaboration associate chair psychiatry Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. David Spiegel, also guest podcast
previously. study explored box breathing. also explored forms
breathing actually compared forms deliberate breathing meditation
means explore going minimal effective doses effective
ways chronically reduce stress around clock improve mood improve
sleep. study referring just published recently. entitled "Brief
Structured Respiration Practices Enhance Mood Reduce Physiological Arousal."
will also provide link paper show note captions. study really
focused simple question, is, shortest effective
practice people can use order reduce levels stress not just


breathwork practice meditation practice around clock, 24 hours day,
including improvements sleep? excited study many
studies explored meditation or, cases, fewer studies explored
breathwork can impact different brain states bodily states. studies
explored breathwork meditation practices influenced body-brain states
around clock people not performing particular meditation
breathwork practice. reason able study really fortunate.
folks WHOOP generous enough donate bunch WHOOP straps,
allowed us measure heart rate variability, number different
physiological parameters. also got subjective reports people's mood
feelings well-being. got data sleep pinged us remote locations.
people, rather brought laboratory artificial
circumstance, laboratory, much like think laboratory realistic--
virtual reality things like that-- nothing realistic real world.
able hundred subjects real world living
real lives pinging back us data time, 24 hours day measure
different interventions asked do, breathwork practices
meditation practices, impacting physiological parameters. also
informing us regularly subjective mood, et cetera. got lot data,
can imagine. basic takeaway study twofold. First all,
discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly
lead improvements focus memory, not much reductions stress, although
lead reductions stress. found number different
breathwork practices-- explored three-- done five minutes day outperformed
meditation terms ability breathwork reduce stress around clock
compared meditation. three types breathwork explored also showed
different effects. mention three types breathwork compared


box breathing sort just learned about. compare something
called cyclic sighing, involves two inhales nose get maximally
inflated lungs followed long exhale. return moment.
repeated five minutes time session. third breathwork practice,
cyclic hyperventilation, which, name suggests, involves people inhaling
deeply nose, exhaling passively mouth, repeating
inhale nose, exhale mouth, repeating 25 cycles, one
cycle inhale exhale. equals one cycle. Repeating 25
cycles, exhaling air holding breath lungs empty 15
30 seconds, repeating inhale, exhale, cyclic hyperventilation duration
five minutes. people divided different groups, either mindfulness
meditation sat, not told control breathing specific
way. closed eyes. focused attention region just behind
forehead. One group that. group cyclic sighing. Another group box
breathing. Another group cyclic hyperventilation. sort clinical trial like
to, swapped people different groups. served
control. evaluate within individual variability. Again,
lot data paper. takeaway sake stress reduction
around clock sake improving sleep mood, effective
practice four practices examined cyclic sighing. Again, cyclic
sighing performed following way. inhale nose deeply
can. second inhale immediately afterwards try maximally inflate
lungs. fact, happens. know second inhale, even
just sharp, short inhale, extra physical vigor required generate
second inhale causes alveoli lungs, may collapsed-- and,
indeed, breaths often even just course day
especially get stressed, alveoli lungs start collapse.
damp inside-- little bit fluid. like balloon
little bit fluid middle. takes little bit physical force pop open. Now,
not literally exploding pop. reinflating air.
perform long exhale mouth lungs empty. looks exactly like
this. [INHALES DEEPLY] [INHALES SHARPLY] [EXHALES] Now, know one

fastest physiologically verified way aware reduce levels stress
reintroduce calm, is, shift autonomic nervous system state
heightened levels autonomic arousal. is, sympathetic nervous system as,
called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything
so-called fight flight, although controls things, too, including positive
arousal. parasympathetic nervous system, often referred rest
digest system, although things, too, associated calming. two
things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep
inhale, short second inhale also nose, long exhale completely
lungs empty, known restore level balance sympathetic-parasympathetic
neural circuitry fastest way reintroduce calm. one physiological sigh.
study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.
translated, again, sorts positive subjective changes-- improvements
sleep, lower resting heart rate times day. important. Again, study
not just exploring happens meditation breathwork, cyclic sighing, et
cetera. exploring changes occur practice translate
changes breathing heart rate, mood, et cetera, throughout 24-hour cycle.
takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress
reduction practice now supported data translate reductions stress
around clock, data say want invest cyclic sighing, is,
double inhale nose, extended exhale mouth lungs


empty, repeat five minutes day. You, course, like,
meditation. still positive effects, meaning reduced stress, although not much
cyclic sighing. box breathing want purpose reducing
stress. practices explored reduce stress. cyclic sighing performed
five minutes day robust pervasive effect reducing stress,
improving mood, improving sleep. first message study. second
takeaway one physiological sigh-- right just one physiological sigh,
inhale deeply nose another inhale nose maximally inflate
alveoli lungs, exhale completely lungs empty go
back normal breathing, fastest way introduce level calm reduce
overall levels stress real time. important. think
days, hear lot stress reduction techniques. stress
reduction techniques explored, everything massage meditation

calm just practice? Great does. also translate
reduced levels stress times 24-hour cycle positive effects
well? one physiological sigh efficient way adjust ratio sympathetic
parasympathetic activation immediately bring calm. excellent
real-time control stress. thing physiological sighs not

Well, lot people will say, oh, not much oxygen there. air thinner.
OK, well, perhaps better way think that, remember talking

00:51:50 Brain Centers & Breathing Rhythm

didn't talk about, however, brain centers actually control phrenic nerve
control breathing. Knowing two brain areas
extremely important, not just understanding content episode
understanding tools discuss and, indeed, general health


relates respiration. basically two areas brain control breathing.
first called pre-Botzinger complex. don't worry name
much. Just know named bottle wine discovered
great Jack Feldman, professor neuroscience University
California, Los Angeles. one fundamental discoveries
neuroscience last hundred years brain area Jack
colleagues discovered controls aspects breathing rhythmic, is,
inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. controlled small
set neurons brainstem area, around region neck, called pre-
Botzinger complex. really owe debt gratitude Jack colleagues
discovering area involved everything breathing

is, function disrupted, may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.

oxygen breathing can't liberated hemoglobin, can't get
brain. observe 30% 40% reduction amount oxygen
delivered brain. reduction carbon dioxide also prevents
normal patterns vasodilation, dilating, opening
capillaries, so, again, less blood flow. importantly, shown paper,
brain overall becomes hyperexcitable. starved oxygen blood
flow. neurons nonspecific way start increasing firing levels.
background activity getting louder louder. like rumble noise
crowd stadium. consequence, sensory input sound
touch event world doesn't get noise.
means hyperventilate, aren't retaining enough carbon
dioxide, not getting enough oxygen tissues need oxygen.
consequence that, brain becomes hyperexcitable. actually know
increase anxiety. become less good, less efficient detecting things
environment. not processing information well all. noise goes up,
signal goes down. Again, incredibly important set findings. also mention
hyperventilation one way that, laboratory anyway neurosurgery units
time, physicians evoke seizure seizure-prone patients. reason
works exactly explanation just gave you. Seizure excitability brain,
not enough inhibition suppression overall circuitry. get waves


storms electrical activity. Low levels carbon dioxide brain
low levels carbon dioxide blood one major triggers seizures. Now,
realize people listening not epileptic. nonetheless, brings
us back question normal healthy breathing. mentioned before,
normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath
minute passes? No. find correct pattern breathing going
involve two things. First all, nasal breathing, resistance provides
nose talked earlier, going deliver oxygen
system. going able generate air pressure fill lungs.
greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen
carbon dioxide proper ways, also taking pauses breaths.
extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.


01:09:44 Tool: Train Healthy Breathing, Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test & Box Breathing

next, like address can normal patterns breathing,
is, anyone can adjust normal patterns breathing unhealthy


unhealthy state. first thing do, course, determine whether
not already breathing unhealthy healthy way. And, again,
say healthy unhealthy, mean, overbreathing? underbreathing?
delivering appropriate ratios oxygen carbon dioxide tissues
brain body? order this, going simple test. Again, please don't
driving operating heavy machinery near water kind.
assuming not things, encourage sit down,
certainly not lie just sit down. suppose also standing.
going called carbon dioxide tolerance test. carbon dioxide
tolerance test sort back envelope measure well managing
carbon dioxide, is, well can control breathing mechanical
chemical level. simple test. going next 10
seconds speaking, just going breathe normally. Now,
throughout episode, going encourage nasal breather
whenever possible. course, instances want engage
mouth breathing. time being, continue blab next
seconds, just inhale nose, exhale nose. don't
deliberately slow breathing increase cadence breathing. However,
time, also going want find sort time measuring device, like
phone stopwatch. going ask
minutes going ask inhale nose deeply possibly
can. is, going fill lungs much can nose.
start timer measure long takes deliberately control
exhale lungs empty. going controlled exhale
nose big deep breath. time being, keep breathing kind calm,
regular cadence. can find time measuring device now, can come
back later like. say inhale, going inhale deeply can
nose, remembering diaphragm can really help get
deep inhale belly move inhale. say start,
going measure time takes complete lungs empty exhale.
fact, measure you. will one rare instances podcast
going long period silence measure something. got
stopwatch here. please prepare big inhale start inhaling now. inhale
deeply can nose. Fill lungs much can. OK? Now


start, meaning slowly control exhale nose. trying let air
slowly possible. just going call every 10 15 seconds so.
want note lungs empty. know can hold breath
lungs empty. not accurate measure. 15 seconds. important
note lungs empty trying control exhale much
possible don't arrive lungs empty time quickly. explain
quickly means. 30 seconds. OK, already reached lungs empty,
please go back breathing normally. haven't, can hang
little longer still discarding air. 45 seconds. rounding
toward minute, not quite there. probably still letting air. want
point none cardiovascular fitness level, least not
kind direct way. 60 seconds. realize will small subset
still expelling air slow lungs-- slow exhale manner
nose. OK, just back envelope carbon dioxide discard rate
need pause go back try just want time long
takes go lungs full lungs empty, again, full understanding know
can sit like beasts hold breath lungs empty.
please don't not going informative telling
now. going tell now took 20 seconds less expel
air, is, couldn't extend exhale longer 20 seconds, kind
back envelope way, can say relatively brief low carbon dioxide
tolerance. took somewhere 25 40, maybe 45 seconds expel
air, is, control exhale 45 seconds 30 seconds,
moderate level carbon dioxide tolerance. if, instance,
able go 50 seconds longer discard hit lungs empty,
fairly high degree carbon dioxide tolerance. Now, deal. low
carbon dioxide tolerance, is, 20 seconds less, going write
number three. moderate levels carbon dioxide tolerance, going
write number five. even put five six.
bracket people able discard air period 50 seconds more,
going write number 8 10. OK? Now, numbers?
talking about? get numbers,
want emphasize again, not fitness level per se. know
world class triathletes fast carbon dioxide blow-off times. is,


discard rates 20 seconds less. also point stressed,
number going small. relaxed, like just woke
long night sleep feel great, number going extended.
back envelope measure going use time decide
exercise going tell moment. exercise going tell
moment can done every day like. interesting
studies, least me, indicate exercise tell even
just twice week greatly improve efficiency breathing shift
away overbreathing rest, even not thinking
breathing rest. exercise? Well, just got number, either
low, medium, high bracket number carbon dioxide discard rate. Remember,
low category, number three. medium, five six.
long carbon dioxide discard rate, long duration carbon dioxide discard
rate, is, 8 10 number. Now going two minutes
people call box breathing. box breathing? Box breathing equal
duration inhale, hold, exhale, hold, repeat. inhale, hold, exhale, hold. Sounds
easy, right? long inhale hold, exhale hold? Well, now
know. low group carbon dioxide discard rate, inhale going
three seconds, hold will three seconds, exhale will three seconds,
repeat, three seconds. side box, will, going
three seconds long. moderate carbon dioxide discard rate category,
going inhale five six seconds, hold five six, exhale five

box breathing-- encouraging phrenic control diaphragm.
getting six liters air per minute using fewer fewer breaths
time. a, again, zero cost-- although cost little bit time-- zero cost
approach adjusting normal pattern breathing rest, huge number
positive outcomes terms ability stay relatively calm, not get

01:22:39 Tool: Breathwork & Stress Reduction; Cyclic Sighing

restore normal patterns breathing not overbreathe therefore not eliminate
much carbon dioxide exactly two tests incorporated study
laboratory collaboration associate chair psychiatry Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. David Spiegel, also guest podcast
previously. study explored box breathing. also explored forms
breathing actually compared forms deliberate breathing meditation
means explore going minimal effective doses effective
ways chronically reduce stress around clock improve mood improve
sleep. study referring just published recently. entitled "Brief
Structured Respiration Practices Enhance Mood Reduce Physiological Arousal."
will also provide link paper show note captions. study really
focused simple question, is, shortest effective
practice people can use order reduce levels stress not just


breathwork practice meditation practice around clock, 24 hours day,
including improvements sleep? excited study many
studies explored meditation or, cases, fewer studies explored
breathwork can impact different brain states bodily states. studies
explored breathwork meditation practices influenced body-brain states
around clock people not performing particular meditation
breathwork practice. reason able study really fortunate.
folks WHOOP generous enough donate bunch WHOOP straps,
allowed us measure heart rate variability, number different
physiological parameters. also got subjective reports people's mood
feelings well-being. got data sleep pinged us remote locations.
people, rather brought laboratory artificial
circumstance, laboratory, much like think laboratory realistic--
virtual reality things like that-- nothing realistic real world.
able hundred subjects real world living
real lives pinging back us data time, 24 hours day measure
different interventions asked do, breathwork practices
meditation practices, impacting physiological parameters. also
informing us regularly subjective mood, et cetera. got lot data,
can imagine. basic takeaway study twofold. First all,
discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly
lead improvements focus memory, not much reductions stress, although
lead reductions stress. found number different
breathwork practices-- explored three-- done five minutes day outperformed
meditation terms ability breathwork reduce stress around clock
compared meditation. three types breathwork explored also showed
different effects. mention three types breathwork compared


box breathing sort just learned about. compare something
called cyclic sighing, involves two inhales nose get maximally
inflated lungs followed long exhale. return moment.
repeated five minutes time session. third breathwork practice,
cyclic hyperventilation, which, name suggests, involves people inhaling
deeply nose, exhaling passively mouth, repeating
inhale nose, exhale mouth, repeating 25 cycles, one
cycle inhale exhale. equals one cycle. Repeating 25
cycles, exhaling air holding breath lungs empty 15
30 seconds, repeating inhale, exhale, cyclic hyperventilation duration
five minutes. people divided different groups, either mindfulness
meditation sat, not told control breathing specific
way. closed eyes. focused attention region just behind
forehead. One group that. group cyclic sighing. Another group box
breathing. Another group cyclic hyperventilation. sort clinical trial like
to, swapped people different groups. served
control. evaluate within individual variability. Again,
lot data paper. takeaway sake stress reduction
around clock sake improving sleep mood, effective
practice four practices examined cyclic sighing. Again, cyclic
sighing performed following way. inhale nose deeply
can. second inhale immediately afterwards try maximally inflate
lungs. fact, happens. know second inhale, even
just sharp, short inhale, extra physical vigor required generate
second inhale causes alveoli lungs, may collapsed-- and,
indeed, breaths often even just course day
especially get stressed, alveoli lungs start collapse.
damp inside-- little bit fluid. like balloon
little bit fluid middle. takes little bit physical force pop open. Now,
not literally exploding pop. reinflating air.
perform long exhale mouth lungs empty. looks exactly like
this. [INHALES DEEPLY] [INHALES SHARPLY] [EXHALES] Now, know one
single physiological sigh sort just described performed time day
conditions, whether not walk stage give talk


meeting feeling stressed, conversation
stressful, can feel stress mounting traffic number
psychological physical stressors may approaching feel
oppressing you, one physiological sigh sort just described
fastest physiologically verified way aware reduce levels stress
reintroduce calm, is, shift autonomic nervous system state
heightened levels autonomic arousal. is, sympathetic nervous system as,
called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything
so-called fight flight, although controls things, too, including positive
arousal. parasympathetic nervous system, often referred rest
digest system, although things, too, associated calming. two
things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep
inhale, short second inhale also nose, long exhale completely
lungs empty, known restore level balance sympathetic-parasympathetic
neural circuitry fastest way reintroduce calm. one physiological sigh.
study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.
translated, again, sorts positive subjective changes-- improvements
sleep, lower resting heart rate times day. important. Again, study
not just exploring happens meditation breathwork, cyclic sighing, et
cetera. exploring changes occur practice translate
changes breathing heart rate, mood, et cetera, throughout 24-hour cycle.
takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress
reduction practice now supported data translate reductions stress
around clock, data say want invest cyclic sighing, is,
double inhale nose, extended exhale mouth lungs


empty, repeat five minutes day. You, course, like,
meditation. still positive effects, meaning reduced stress, although not much
cyclic sighing. box breathing want purpose reducing
stress. practices explored reduce stress. cyclic sighing performed
five minutes day robust pervasive effect reducing stress,
improving mood, improving sleep. first message study. second
takeaway one physiological sigh-- right just one physiological sigh,
inhale deeply nose another inhale nose maximally inflate
alveoli lungs, exhale completely lungs empty go
back normal breathing, fastest way introduce level calm reduce
overall levels stress real time. important. think
days, hear lot stress reduction techniques. stress
reduction techniques explored, everything massage meditation
breathwork hot shower foot rub, will calm down. question is,
calm just practice? Great does. also translate
reduced levels stress times 24-hour cycle positive effects
well? one physiological sigh efficient way adjust ratio sympathetic
parasympathetic activation immediately bring calm. excellent
real-time control stress. thing physiological sighs not
hack. not application breathing practice something wasn't intended
for. fact, physiological sighs not discovered all. discovered
physiologists

want much system. people, whether not asleep
awake, engage physiological sigh spontaneously, subconsciously.
double inhale nose extended exhale mouth.
not just eliminate excessive carbon dioxide system. also rebalanced
oxygen-carbon dioxide ratio proper ways. fact, observed animals.
might see animals tired. animals humans get tired, tend

01:39:16 Breathing & Heart Rate Variability

organs neighborhood, talk relationship
breathing heart rate. incredibly important topic, much
perhaps brought beginning episode. nonetheless,
now know diaphragm does. inhale, diaphragm moves down.
right. contract diaphragm, moves down. creates space
lungs inhale. exhale, diaphragm moves up. Well, inhale
diaphragm moves down, happens space created


thoracic cavity particularly also breathing deeply using

called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, basis call heart rate variability.
Heart rate variability involves vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve,
parasympathetic nerve associated calming aspect autonomic

think people agree one hiccup sort funny.

01:46:21 Tool: Stop Hiccups

Two hiccups row really funny. three hiccups row starts
concerning, part hiccups can kind painful. can experience pain

Fortunately, simple way get rid hiccups. can arrive simple
technique understand little bit gives rise hiccups. reason
get hiccups experience spasm phrenic nerve. phrenic
nerve, recall, nerve emanates cervical region, specific C3,

Again, doesn't tend work lot time. people, works every time.
people, doesn't work all. However, technique can reliably
eliminate hiccups. technique takes advantage hypercontracting
phrenic nerve short period time subsequently relaxes
alleviates spasming phrenic nerve. simple method inhale three
times row. unusual pattern breathing. involves taking
big, deep inhale nose. exhale air, take second
inhale nose, however brief inhale might be, third even micro
millisecond long inhale nose get third inhale. hold
breath 15 20 seconds, slowly exhale. even though not
experiencing hiccups right now. will demonstrate method eliminating

focused breathing techniques emphasize exhale,

01:51:17 Tool: Stress Management & Cyclic Hyperventilation, “Wim Hof Method”

whether not carbon dioxide tolerance test, whether not cyclic sighing
physiological sigh use real time reduce stress. One thing
haven't talked much cyclic hyperventilation. Cyclic hyperventilation,
recall, bout 25 breaths inhaling deeply nose passively

like this. [HYPERVENTILATES] active inhale nose exhale

extremely important, not just understanding content episode
understanding tools discuss and, indeed, general health


relates respiration. basically two areas brain control breathing.
first called pre-Botzinger complex. don't worry name

discovering area involved everything breathing

Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways

us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths

breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel

extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger

told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable

bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack

don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly

healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly

01:22:39 Tool: Breathwork & Stress Reduction; Cyclic Sighing

restore normal patterns breathing not overbreathe therefore not eliminate
much carbon dioxide exactly two tests incorporated study
laboratory collaboration associate chair psychiatry Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. David Spiegel, also guest podcast
previously. study explored box breathing. also explored forms
breathing actually compared forms deliberate breathing meditation
means explore going minimal effective doses effective
ways chronically reduce stress around clock improve mood improve
sleep. study referring just published recently. entitled "Brief
Structured Respiration Practices Enhance Mood Reduce Physiological Arousal."
will also provide link paper show note captions. study really
focused simple question, is, shortest effective
practice people can use order reduce levels stress not just


breathwork practice meditation practice around clock, 24 hours day,
including improvements sleep? excited study many
studies explored meditation or, cases, fewer studies explored
breathwork can impact different brain states bodily states. studies
explored breathwork meditation practices influenced body-brain states
around clock people not performing particular meditation
breathwork practice. reason able study really fortunate.
folks WHOOP generous enough donate bunch WHOOP straps,
allowed us measure heart rate variability, number different
physiological parameters. also got subjective reports people's mood
feelings well-being. got data sleep pinged us remote locations.
people, rather brought laboratory artificial
circumstance, laboratory, much like think laboratory realistic--
virtual reality things like that-- nothing realistic real world.
able hundred subjects real world living
real lives pinging back us data time, 24 hours day measure
different interventions asked do, breathwork practices
meditation practices, impacting physiological parameters. also
informing us regularly subjective mood, et cetera. got lot data,
can imagine. basic takeaway study twofold. First all,
discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly
lead improvements focus memory, not much reductions stress, although
lead reductions stress. found number different
breathwork practices-- explored three-- done five minutes day outperformed
meditation terms ability breathwork reduce stress around clock
compared meditation. three types breathwork explored also showed
different effects. mention three types breathwork compared


box breathing sort just learned about. compare something
called cyclic sighing, involves two inhales nose get maximally
inflated lungs followed long exhale. return moment.
repeated five minutes time session. third breathwork practice,
cyclic hyperventilation, which, name suggests, involves people inhaling
deeply nose, exhaling passively mouth, repeating
inhale nose, exhale mouth, repeating 25 cycles, one
cycle inhale exhale. equals one cycle. Repeating 25
cycles, exhaling air holding breath lungs empty 15
30 seconds, repeating inhale, exhale, cyclic hyperventilation duration
five minutes. people divided different groups, either mindfulness
meditation sat, not told control breathing specific
way. closed eyes. focused attention region just behind
forehead. One group that. group cyclic sighing. Another group box
breathing. Another group cyclic hyperventilation. sort clinical trial like
to, swapped people different groups. served
control. evaluate within individual variability. Again,
lot data paper. takeaway sake stress reduction
around clock sake improving sleep mood, effective
practice four practices examined cyclic sighing. Again, cyclic
sighing performed following way. inhale nose deeply
can. second inhale immediately afterwards try maximally inflate
lungs. fact, happens. know second inhale, even
just sharp, short inhale, extra physical vigor required generate
second inhale causes alveoli lungs, may collapsed-- and,
indeed, breaths often even just course day
especially get stressed, alveoli lungs start collapse.
damp inside-- little bit fluid. like balloon
little bit fluid middle. takes little bit physical force pop open. Now,
not literally exploding pop. reinflating air.
perform long exhale mouth lungs empty. looks exactly like
this. [INHALES DEEPLY] [INHALES SHARPLY] [EXHALES] Now, know one
single physiological sigh sort just described performed time day
conditions, whether not walk stage give talk


meeting feeling stressed, conversation
stressful, can feel stress mounting traffic number
psychological physical stressors may approaching feel
oppressing you, one physiological sigh sort just described
fastest physiologically verified way aware reduce levels stress
reintroduce calm, is, shift autonomic nervous system state
heightened levels autonomic arousal. is, sympathetic nervous system as,
called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything
so-called fight flight, although controls things, too, including positive
arousal. parasympathetic nervous system, often referred rest
digest system, although things, too, associated calming. two
things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep
inhale, short second inhale also nose, long exhale completely
lungs empty, known restore level balance sympathetic-parasympathetic
neural circuitry fastest way reintroduce calm. one physiological sigh.
study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.
translated, again, sorts positive subjective changes-- improvements
sleep, lower resting heart rate times day. important. Again, study
not just exploring happens meditation breathwork, cyclic sighing, et
cetera. exploring changes occur practice translate
changes breathing heart rate, mood, et cetera, throughout 24-hour cycle.
takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress
reduction practice now supported data translate reductions stress
around clock, data say want invest cyclic sighing, is,
double inhale nose, extended exhale mouth lungs


empty, repeat five minutes day. You, course, like,
meditation. still positive effects, meaning reduced stress, although not much
cyclic sighing. box breathing want purpose reducing
stress. practices explored reduce stress. cyclic sighing performed
five minutes day robust pervasive effect reducing stress,
improving mood, improving sleep. first message study. second
takeaway one physiological sigh-- right just one physiological sigh,
inhale deeply nose another inhale nose maximally inflate
alveoli lungs, exhale completely lungs empty go
back normal breathing, fastest way introduce level calm reduce
overall levels stress real time. important. think
days, hear lot stress reduction techniques. stress
reduction techniques explored, everything massage meditation
breathwork hot shower foot rub, will calm down. question is,
calm just practice? Great does. also translate
reduced levels stress times 24-hour cycle positive effects
well? one physiological sigh efficient way adjust ratio sympathetic
parasympathetic activation immediately bring calm. excellent
real-time control stress. thing physiological sighs not
hack. not application breathing practice something wasn't intended
for. fact, physiological sighs not discovered all. discovered

01:39:16 Breathing & Heart Rate Variability

organs neighborhood, talk relationship
breathing heart rate. incredibly important topic, much
perhaps brought beginning episode. nonetheless,
now know diaphragm does. inhale, diaphragm moves down.
right. contract diaphragm, moves down. creates space
lungs inhale. exhale, diaphragm moves up. Well, inhale
diaphragm moves down, happens space created


thoracic cavity particularly also breathing deeply using
intercostal muscles expand ribs. consequence, heart actually gets
little bit bigger. temporary enlargement heart. real enlargement.
consequence, whatever blood heart now larger volume
heart got bigger. consequence, blood moving slowly

reduce volume heart overall, blood flow heart
accelerates smaller volume. given unit blood going move
quickly small volume. nervous system detects sends
signal slow heart down. just inhales speed heart up, exhales slow
heart rate down. Now, course, even though can double inhales even
triple inhales, sooner later, inhale, going exhale.
converse also true, course. mean terms controlling
heart rate? Well, say going blood draw, going stage

physiological sighs bring level calm level stress down.
Nonetheless, reason want quickly reduce heart rate

additionally, not just use physiological sigh, well, can take advantage
relationship inhales exhales controlling heart rate. want increase
heart rate, can simply inhale longer vigorously relative
exhales. want decrease heart rate, well, going make
exhales longer and/or vigorous inhales. fact, process,
called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, basis call heart rate variability.
Heart rate variability involves vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve,
parasympathetic nerve associated calming aspect autonomic
nervous system, slowing heart rate extending exhales. really
forms basis breathing practices. look breathing practices,
whether not Wim Hof breathing, Tummo breathing, Kundalini breathing,
Pranayama breathing, physiological sighing, cyclic sighing, on,

feature, physicians call respiratory sinus arrhythmia, sometimes hear
often nowadays heart rate variability, something people sport

number different contexts, including sport, military. also now
incorporated clinical context people feel panic attack coming on.
gratified learn physiological sigh now explored tool prevent

exhale really terrific skill master, easy skill master, frankly.
say skill? Well, remember said earlier, humans inhale actively


typically will passively exhale, just let air [EXHALES] drop
whatever rate, depending much air inhaled. Actively exhaling, is,
actively relaxing diaphragm actively relaxing intercostal muscles

Fortunately, simple way get rid hiccups. can arrive simple
technique understand little bit gives rise hiccups. reason
get hiccups experience spasm phrenic nerve. phrenic

Again, doesn't tend work lot time. people, works every time.
people, doesn't work all. However, technique can reliably
eliminate hiccups. technique takes advantage hypercontracting
phrenic nerve short period time subsequently relaxes
alleviates spasming phrenic nerve. simple method inhale three

00:51:50 Brain Centers & Breathing Rhythm

already talked phrenic nerve, nerve innervates diaphragm
allows lungs fill movement diaphragm.
didn't talk about, however, brain centers actually control phrenic nerve
control breathing. Knowing two brain areas
extremely important, not just understanding content episode
understanding tools discuss and, indeed, general health


relates respiration. basically two areas brain control breathing.
first called pre-Botzinger complex. don't worry name
much. Just know named bottle wine discovered
great Jack Feldman, professor neuroscience University
California, Los Angeles. one fundamental discoveries
neuroscience last hundred years brain area Jack
colleagues discovered controls aspects breathing rhythmic, is,
inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. controlled small
set neurons brainstem area, around region neck, called pre-
Botzinger complex. really owe debt gratitude Jack colleagues
discovering area involved everything breathing
asleep breathing not thinking breathing. may role--
is, function disrupted, may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.
event, pre-Botzinger complex controlling inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale patterns

so-called parafacial nucleus. parafacial nucleus involved patterns

yes, inhales active exhales passive. now going make
exhales active well. rather just inhale let lungs deflate,

fact, parafacial nucleus one relying speak order
make sure still get enough oxygen. also one will use
incorporate physiological sigh box breathing. And, frankly, time,

feel really alert. And, indeed, happens. people feel alert. However,
not bringing enough carbon dioxide or, rather, proper way say
overbreathing, exhaling much, not retaining
keeping enough carbon dioxide. Well, lack carbon dioxide means
oxygen breathing can't liberated hemoglobin, can't get

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking

12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal

extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning

bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack

don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies

healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee

holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show

nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

00:51:50 Brain Centers & Breathing Rhythm

already talked phrenic nerve, nerve innervates diaphragm
allows lungs fill movement diaphragm.
didn't talk about, however, brain centers actually control phrenic nerve
control breathing. Knowing two brain areas
extremely important, not just understanding content episode
understanding tools discuss and, indeed, general health


relates respiration. basically two areas brain control breathing.
first called pre-Botzinger complex. don't worry name
much. Just know named bottle wine discovered
great Jack Feldman, professor neuroscience University
California, Los Angeles. one fundamental discoveries
neuroscience last hundred years brain area Jack
colleagues discovered controls aspects breathing rhythmic, is,
inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. controlled small
set neurons brainstem area, around region neck, called pre-
Botzinger complex. really owe debt gratitude Jack colleagues
discovering area involved everything breathing
asleep breathing not thinking breathing. may role--
is, function disrupted, may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.
event, pre-Botzinger complex controlling inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale patterns
breathing. brain center controlling breathing, again, phrenic nerve-
- converges goes phrenic nerve intercostal muscles--
so-called parafacial nucleus. parafacial nucleus involved patterns
breathing not inhale followed exhale, inhale followed exhale--
is, not rhythmic, one other-- but, rather, doubling
inhales doubling exhales deliberate pause breathing, inhale, pause,


exhale, pause, inhale, pause, exhale, pause, sort thing. little bit later, talk
pattern breathing called box breathing, specific useful
applications, particular adjusting anxiety. case, involves going
rhythmic breathing inhale, inhale, inhale, exhale, is, relying pre-Botzinger
complex neurons, reliance parafacial nucleus neurons box breathing, just
give away probably already obvious, inhale, hold, exhale, hold,
repeat. pattern breathing, even though rhythmic nature
inhales precede exhales precede inhales on, deliberate breath hold
inserted there. anytime taking conscious control breathing, parafacial
nucleus getting involved. Now, don't assume parafacial nucleus
way take conscious control breathing. can also take
control pre-Botzinger complex. can right now. instance,
breathing specific pattern now that, unless speaking eating, no doubt
going involve inhales followed exhales. could, instance, decide that,
yes, inhales active exhales passive. now going make
exhales active well. rather just inhale let lungs deflate,
inhale [INHALES] force air out. [EXHALES] going represent
conscious taking control pre-Botzinger complex. reason
giving mechanistic detail is, A, super important want understand
tools related breathing. B, actually pretty simple system. Even though areas
fancy names like pre-Botzinger parafacial, pretty straightforward.
one area controls rhythmic breathing-- inhale follows exhales-- area
gets involved breathing time start doubling inhales exhales.
fact, parafacial nucleus one relying speak order
make sure still get enough oxygen. also one will use
incorporate physiological sigh box breathing. And, frankly, time,
using circuits brain systems, parafacial pre-Botzinger,
parallel. Again, biology loves parallel systems, especially things critical
didn't them, die, like breathing. makes sense
two different brain structures control this. now understanding

said little bit earlier well, breathing incredible represents
interface conscious subconscious control not just body, not
just lungs, breathe influences brain state. using
brain consciously control breathing, using brain control
brain. best way ever heard described beautiful, say now
classic paper Journal Physiology, published 1988 Balestrino
Somjen, final line summary intro states, "The brain, regulating
breathing, controls excitability." just remind don't
remember excitability is, excitability threshold given neuron, nerve

likely get engaged. likely active. breathe
ways, brain becomes harder activate. excitability reduced. Now,
might think excitability great thing. always want brain excitable.
actually not case. And, fact, statement Balestrino Somjen
made led number investigations really important defining
people overbreathe, is, hyperventilate, rest, expel, is, exhale

bringing lot oxygen, people hyperventilating.
feel really alert. And, indeed, happens. people feel alert. However,
not bringing enough carbon dioxide or, rather, proper way say
overbreathing, exhaling much, not retaining
keeping enough carbon dioxide. Well, lack carbon dioxide means
oxygen breathing can't liberated hemoglobin, can't get
brain. observe 30% 40% reduction amount oxygen
delivered brain. reduction carbon dioxide also prevents
normal patterns vasodilation, dilating, opening
capillaries, so, again, less blood flow. importantly, shown paper,

consequence that, brain becomes hyperexcitable. actually know

realize people listening not epileptic. nonetheless, brings
us back question normal healthy breathing. mentioned before,
normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath

involve two things. First all, nasal breathing, resistance provides
nose talked earlier, going deliver oxygen
system. going able generate air pressure fill lungs.
greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen
carbon dioxide proper ways, also taking pauses breaths.
extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.

01:22:39 Tool: Breathwork & Stress Reduction; Cyclic Sighing

restore normal patterns breathing not overbreathe therefore not eliminate

can imagine. basic takeaway study twofold. First all,
discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly

called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything
so-called fight flight, although controls things, too, including positive
arousal. parasympathetic nervous system, often referred rest

things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep
inhale, short second inhale also nose, long exhale completely

study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.

takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress
reduction practice now supported data translate reductions stress

nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal

seconds speaking, just going breathe normally. Now,
throughout episode, going encourage nasal breather
whenever possible. course, instances want engage
mouth breathing. time being, continue blab next
seconds, just inhale nose, exhale nose. don't
deliberately slow breathing increase cadence breathing. However,
time, also going want find sort time measuring device, like

minutes going ask inhale nose deeply possibly
can. is, going fill lungs much can nose.
start timer measure long takes deliberately control
exhale lungs empty. going controlled exhale
nose big deep breath. time being, keep breathing kind calm,
regular cadence. can find time measuring device now, can come
back later like. say inhale, going inhale deeply can
nose, remembering diaphragm can really help get
deep inhale belly move inhale. say start,
going measure time takes complete lungs empty exhale.
fact, measure you. will one rare instances podcast
going long period silence measure something. got
stopwatch here. please prepare big inhale start inhaling now. inhale
deeply can nose. Fill lungs much can. OK? Now


start, meaning slowly control exhale nose. trying let air
slowly possible. just going call every 10 15 seconds so.
want note lungs empty. know can hold breath
lungs empty. not accurate measure. 15 seconds. important
note lungs empty trying control exhale much
possible don't arrive lungs empty time quickly. explain
quickly means. 30 seconds. OK, already reached lungs empty,
please go back breathing normally. haven't, can hang
little longer still discarding air. 45 seconds. rounding

need pause go back try just want time long
takes go lungs full lungs empty, again, full understanding know
can sit like beasts hold breath lungs empty.
please don't not going informative telling
now. going tell now took 20 seconds less expel

moderate level carbon dioxide tolerance. if, instance,
able go 50 seconds longer discard hit lungs empty,
fairly high degree carbon dioxide tolerance. Now, deal. low
carbon dioxide tolerance, is, 20 seconds less, going write
number three. moderate levels carbon dioxide tolerance, going
write number five. even put five six.
bracket people able discard air period 50 seconds more,
going write number 8 10. OK? Now, numbers?
talking about? get numbers,
want emphasize again, not fitness level per se. know
world class triathletes fast carbon dioxide blow-off times. is,

low category, number three. medium, five six.
long carbon dioxide discard rate, long duration carbon dioxide discard
rate, is, 8 10 number. Now going two minutes
people call box breathing. box breathing? Box breathing equal

01:22:39 Tool: Breathwork & Stress Reduction; Cyclic Sighing

restore normal patterns breathing not overbreathe therefore not eliminate
much carbon dioxide exactly two tests incorporated study
laboratory collaboration associate chair psychiatry Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. David Spiegel, also guest podcast
previously. study explored box breathing. also explored forms
breathing actually compared forms deliberate breathing meditation
means explore going minimal effective doses effective
ways chronically reduce stress around clock improve mood improve
sleep. study referring just published recently. entitled "Brief
Structured Respiration Practices Enhance Mood Reduce Physiological Arousal."
will also provide link paper show note captions. study really
focused simple question, is, shortest effective
practice people can use order reduce levels stress not just


breathwork practice meditation practice around clock, 24 hours day,
including improvements sleep? excited study many
studies explored meditation or, cases, fewer studies explored
breathwork can impact different brain states bodily states. studies
explored breathwork meditation practices influenced body-brain states
around clock people not performing particular meditation
breathwork practice. reason able study really fortunate.
folks WHOOP generous enough donate bunch WHOOP straps,
allowed us measure heart rate variability, number different
physiological parameters. also got subjective reports people's mood
feelings well-being. got data sleep pinged us remote locations.
people, rather brought laboratory artificial
circumstance, laboratory, much like think laboratory realistic--
virtual reality things like that-- nothing realistic real world.
able hundred subjects real world living
real lives pinging back us data time, 24 hours day measure
different interventions asked do, breathwork practices
meditation practices, impacting physiological parameters. also
informing us regularly subjective mood, et cetera. got lot data,
can imagine. basic takeaway study twofold. First all,
discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly
lead improvements focus memory, not much reductions stress, although
lead reductions stress. found number different
breathwork practices-- explored three-- done five minutes day outperformed
meditation terms ability breathwork reduce stress around clock
compared meditation. three types breathwork explored also showed
different effects. mention three types breathwork compared


box breathing sort just learned about. compare something
called cyclic sighing, involves two inhales nose get maximally
inflated lungs followed long exhale. return moment.
repeated five minutes time session. third breathwork practice,
cyclic hyperventilation, which, name suggests, involves people inhaling
deeply nose, exhaling passively mouth, repeating
inhale nose, exhale mouth, repeating 25 cycles, one
cycle inhale exhale. equals one cycle. Repeating 25
cycles, exhaling air holding breath lungs empty 15
30 seconds, repeating inhale, exhale, cyclic hyperventilation duration
five minutes. people divided different groups, either mindfulness
meditation sat, not told control breathing specific
way. closed eyes. focused attention region just behind
forehead. One group that. group cyclic sighing. Another group box
breathing. Another group cyclic hyperventilation. sort clinical trial like
to, swapped people different groups. served
control. evaluate within individual variability. Again,
lot data paper. takeaway sake stress reduction
around clock sake improving sleep mood, effective
practice four practices examined cyclic sighing. Again, cyclic
sighing performed following way. inhale nose deeply
can. second inhale immediately afterwards try maximally inflate
lungs. fact, happens. know second inhale, even
just sharp, short inhale, extra physical vigor required generate
second inhale causes alveoli lungs, may collapsed-- and,
indeed, breaths often even just course day
especially get stressed, alveoli lungs start collapse.
damp inside-- little bit fluid. like balloon
little bit fluid middle. takes little bit physical force pop open. Now,
not literally exploding pop. reinflating air.
perform long exhale mouth lungs empty. looks exactly like
this. [INHALES DEEPLY] [INHALES SHARPLY] [EXHALES] Now, know one
single physiological sigh sort just described performed time day
conditions, whether not walk stage give talk


meeting feeling stressed, conversation
stressful, can feel stress mounting traffic number
psychological physical stressors may approaching feel
oppressing you, one physiological sigh sort just described
fastest physiologically verified way aware reduce levels stress
reintroduce calm, is, shift autonomic nervous system state
heightened levels autonomic arousal. is, sympathetic nervous system as,
called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything
so-called fight flight, although controls things, too, including positive
arousal. parasympathetic nervous system, often referred rest
digest system, although things, too, associated calming. two
things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep
inhale, short second inhale also nose, long exhale completely
lungs empty, known restore level balance sympathetic-parasympathetic
neural circuitry fastest way reintroduce calm. one physiological sigh.
study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.
translated, again, sorts positive subjective changes-- improvements
sleep, lower resting heart rate times day. important. Again, study
not just exploring happens meditation breathwork, cyclic sighing, et
cetera. exploring changes occur practice translate
changes breathing heart rate, mood, et cetera, throughout 24-hour cycle.
takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress
reduction practice now supported data translate reductions stress
around clock, data say want invest cyclic sighing, is,
double inhale nose, extended exhale mouth lungs


empty, repeat five minutes day. You, course, like,
meditation. still positive effects, meaning reduced stress, although not much
cyclic sighing. box breathing want purpose reducing
stress. practices explored reduce stress. cyclic sighing performed
five minutes day robust pervasive effect reducing stress,
improving mood, improving sleep. first message study. second
takeaway one physiological sigh-- right just one physiological sigh,
inhale deeply nose another inhale nose maximally inflate
alveoli lungs, exhale completely lungs empty go
back normal breathing, fastest way introduce level calm reduce
overall levels stress real time. important. think
days, hear lot stress reduction techniques. stress
reduction techniques explored, everything massage meditation
breathwork hot shower foot rub, will calm down. question is,
calm just practice? Great does. also translate
reduced levels stress times 24-hour cycle positive effects
well? one physiological sigh efficient way adjust ratio sympathetic
parasympathetic activation immediately bring calm. excellent
real-time control stress. thing physiological sighs not
hack. not application breathing practice something wasn't intended
for. fact, physiological sighs not discovered all. discovered

01:39:16 Breathing & Heart Rate Variability

organs neighborhood, talk relationship
breathing heart rate. incredibly important topic, much
perhaps brought beginning episode. nonetheless,
now know diaphragm does. inhale, diaphragm moves down.
right. contract diaphragm, moves down. creates space
lungs inhale. exhale, diaphragm moves up. Well, inhale
diaphragm moves down, happens space created


thoracic cavity particularly also breathing deeply using
intercostal muscles expand ribs. consequence, heart actually gets

consequence, whatever blood heart now larger volume
heart got bigger. consequence, blood moving slowly

reduce volume heart overall, blood flow heart
accelerates smaller volume. given unit blood going move
quickly small volume. nervous system detects sends

heart rate down. Now, course, even though can double inhales even
triple inhales, sooner later, inhale, going exhale.
converse also true, course. mean terms controlling
heart rate? Well, say going blood draw, going stage

physiological sighs bring level calm level stress down.
Nonetheless, reason want quickly reduce heart rate

additionally, not just use physiological sigh, well, can take advantage
relationship inhales exhales controlling heart rate. want increase
heart rate, can simply inhale longer vigorously relative
exhales. want decrease heart rate, well, going make
exhales longer and/or vigorous inhales. fact, process,
called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, basis call heart rate variability.
Heart rate variability involves vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve,
parasympathetic nerve associated calming aspect autonomic
nervous system, slowing heart rate extending exhales. really
forms basis breathing practices. look breathing practices,

exhale really terrific skill master, easy skill master, frankly.
say skill? Well, remember said earlier, humans inhale actively


typically will passively exhale, just let air [EXHALES] drop

Two hiccups row really funny. three hiccups row starts
concerning, part hiccups can kind painful. can experience pain

Fortunately, simple way get rid hiccups. can arrive simple
technique understand little bit gives rise hiccups. reason
get hiccups experience spasm phrenic nerve. phrenic

Again, doesn't tend work lot time. people, works every time.
people, doesn't work all. However, technique can reliably
eliminate hiccups. technique takes advantage hypercontracting
phrenic nerve short period time subsequently relaxes
alleviates spasming phrenic nerve. simple method inhale three

title paper "Nasal Respiration Entrains Human Limbic Oscillations
Modulates Cognitive Function." paper followed earlier paper
showed people breathe nose, recognition
discrimination different odors far greater breathe
mouth. Now, result interesting, also sort duh smell
things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal
inhalations versus nasal exhalations versus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.
basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal
noise talked earlier, recall, ability brain detect things
environment, increased inhalations. earlier study focused
smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate
variables. paper, one just mentioned, "Nasal Respiration Entrains
Human Limbic Oscillations Modulates Cognitive Function," not look
detection odors. Rather, looked things like reaction time fear. basically,
found reaction time greatly reduced people inhaling.
people look fearful stimuli. looked reaction time fearful stimuli,

first called pre-Botzinger complex. don't worry name
much. Just know named bottle wine discovered
great Jack Feldman, professor neuroscience University
California, Los Angeles. one fundamental discoveries
neuroscience last hundred years brain area Jack
colleagues discovered controls aspects breathing rhythmic, is,
inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. controlled small
set neurons brainstem area, around region neck, called pre-
Botzinger complex. really owe debt gratitude Jack colleagues
discovering area involved everything breathing
asleep breathing not thinking breathing. may role--
is, function disrupted, may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.
Believe not, can explain large part many deaths related opioid crisis
exogenous opioids like fentanyl sorts drugs, opioids
obviously, bind opioid receptors structure shut down. Now, keep mind
neurons designed incredibly robust designed fire inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale no matter awake aware, unaware asleep keep us
alive. Exogenous opioids like fentanyl drugs similar can shut
structure rich opioid receptors. binds that,
shuts off pre-Botzinger complex, major cause death people die
opioid overdoses. think lot people don't realize that. think, oh,
opioids must shut off brain shut heart. No, shuts breathing.
Jack's discovery no doubt will lead important things relates addiction,
hopefully think frankly can expect also going eventually lead ways
prevent death people using opioids types drugs, maybe blocking
opioid receptors pre-Botzinger complex using things like naltrexone, et cetera.

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths

12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large

ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per

extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee

holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show

discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing

research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly

showed people breathe nose, recognition

nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal

smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate

means hyperventilate, aren't retaining enough carbon
dioxide, not getting enough oxygen tissues need oxygen.
consequence that, brain becomes hyperexcitable. actually know
increase anxiety. become less good, less efficient detecting things
environment. not processing information well all. noise goes up,
signal goes down. Again, incredibly important set findings. also mention
hyperventilation one way that, laboratory anyway neurosurgery units
time, physicians evoke seizure seizure-prone patients. reason
works exactly explanation just gave you. Seizure excitability brain,
not enough inhibition suppression overall circuitry. get waves


storms electrical activity. Low levels carbon dioxide brain
low levels carbon dioxide blood one major triggers seizures. Now,
realize people listening not epileptic. nonetheless, brings
us back question normal healthy breathing. mentioned before,
normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath
minute passes? No. find correct pattern breathing going
involve two things. First all, nasal breathing, resistance provides
nose talked earlier, going deliver oxygen
system. going able generate air pressure fill lungs.
greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen
carbon dioxide proper ways, also taking pauses breaths.
extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.


01:09:44 Tool: Train Healthy Breathing, Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test & Box Breathing

next, like address can normal patterns breathing,
is, anyone can adjust normal patterns breathing unhealthy


unhealthy state. first thing do, course, determine whether
not already breathing unhealthy healthy way. And, again,
say healthy unhealthy, mean, overbreathing? underbreathing?
delivering appropriate ratios oxygen carbon dioxide tissues
brain body? order this, going simple test. Again, please don't
driving operating heavy machinery near water kind.
assuming not things, encourage sit down,
certainly not lie just sit down. suppose also standing.
going called carbon dioxide tolerance test. carbon dioxide
tolerance test sort back envelope measure well managing
carbon dioxide, is, well can control breathing mechanical
chemical level. simple test. going next 10
seconds speaking, just going breathe normally. Now,
throughout episode, going encourage nasal breather
whenever possible. course, instances want engage
mouth breathing. time being, continue blab next
seconds, just inhale nose, exhale nose. don't
deliberately slow breathing increase cadence breathing. However,
time, also going want find sort time measuring device, like
phone stopwatch. going ask
minutes going ask inhale nose deeply possibly
can. is, going fill lungs much can nose.
start timer measure long takes deliberately control
exhale lungs empty. going controlled exhale
nose big deep breath. time being, keep breathing kind calm,
regular cadence. can find time measuring device now, can come
back later like. say inhale, going inhale deeply can
nose, remembering diaphragm can really help get
deep inhale belly move inhale. say start,
going measure time takes complete lungs empty exhale.
fact, measure you. will one rare instances podcast
going long period silence measure something. got
stopwatch here. please prepare big inhale start inhaling now. inhale
deeply can nose. Fill lungs much can. OK? Now


start, meaning slowly control exhale nose. trying let air
slowly possible. just going call every 10 15 seconds so.
want note lungs empty. know can hold breath
lungs empty. not accurate measure. 15 seconds. important
note lungs empty trying control exhale much
possible don't arrive lungs empty time quickly. explain
quickly means. 30 seconds. OK, already reached lungs empty,
please go back breathing normally. haven't, can hang
little longer still discarding air. 45 seconds. rounding
toward minute, not quite there. probably still letting air. want
point none cardiovascular fitness level, least not
kind direct way. 60 seconds. realize will small subset
still expelling air slow lungs-- slow exhale manner
nose. OK, just back envelope carbon dioxide discard rate
need pause go back try just want time long
takes go lungs full lungs empty, again, full understanding know
can sit like beasts hold breath lungs empty.
please don't not going informative telling
now. going tell now took 20 seconds less expel
air, is, couldn't extend exhale longer 20 seconds, kind
back envelope way, can say relatively brief low carbon dioxide
tolerance. took somewhere 25 40, maybe 45 seconds expel
air, is, control exhale 45 seconds 30 seconds,
moderate level carbon dioxide tolerance. if, instance,
able go 50 seconds longer discard hit lungs empty,
fairly high degree carbon dioxide tolerance. Now, deal. low
carbon dioxide tolerance, is, 20 seconds less, going write
number three. moderate levels carbon dioxide tolerance, going
write number five. even put five six.
bracket people able discard air period 50 seconds more,
going write number 8 10. OK? Now, numbers?
talking about? get numbers,
want emphasize again, not fitness level per se. know
world class triathletes fast carbon dioxide blow-off times. is,


discard rates 20 seconds less. also point stressed,
number going small. relaxed, like just woke
long night sleep feel great, number going extended.
back envelope measure going use time decide
exercise going tell moment. exercise going tell
moment can done every day like. interesting
studies, least me, indicate exercise tell even
just twice week greatly improve efficiency breathing shift
away overbreathing rest, even not thinking
breathing rest. exercise? Well, just got number, either
low, medium, high bracket number carbon dioxide discard rate. Remember,
low category, number three. medium, five six.
long carbon dioxide discard rate, long duration carbon dioxide discard
rate, is, 8 10 number. Now going two minutes
people call box breathing. box breathing? Box breathing equal
duration inhale, hold, exhale, hold, repeat. inhale, hold, exhale, hold. Sounds
easy, right? long inhale hold, exhale hold? Well, now
know. low group carbon dioxide discard rate, inhale going
three seconds, hold will three seconds, exhale will three seconds,
repeat, three seconds. side box, will, going
three seconds long. moderate carbon dioxide discard rate category,
going inhale five six seconds, hold five six, exhale five
six, hold five six, repeat two minutes. three minutes
want. think important protocols feasible people.
going mean things two five minutes comes
breath rehabilitation exercises restoring normal breathing. then, course,
long category carbon dioxide discard rate, able 8
10 second inhale, 8 10 second hold, 8 10 second exhale, 8 10 second hold,

box breathing-- encouraging phrenic control diaphragm.
getting six liters air per minute using fewer fewer breaths
time. a, again, zero cost-- although cost little bit time-- zero cost
approach adjusting normal pattern breathing rest, huge number
positive outcomes terms ability stay relatively calm, not get

01:22:39 Tool: Breathwork & Stress Reduction; Cyclic Sighing

restore normal patterns breathing not overbreathe therefore not eliminate
much carbon dioxide exactly two tests incorporated study
laboratory collaboration associate chair psychiatry Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. David Spiegel, also guest podcast
previously. study explored box breathing. also explored forms
breathing actually compared forms deliberate breathing meditation
means explore going minimal effective doses effective
ways chronically reduce stress around clock improve mood improve
sleep. study referring just published recently. entitled "Brief
Structured Respiration Practices Enhance Mood Reduce Physiological Arousal."
will also provide link paper show note captions. study really
focused simple question, is, shortest effective
practice people can use order reduce levels stress not just


breathwork practice meditation practice around clock, 24 hours day,
including improvements sleep? excited study many
studies explored meditation or, cases, fewer studies explored
breathwork can impact different brain states bodily states. studies
explored breathwork meditation practices influenced body-brain states
around clock people not performing particular meditation
breathwork practice. reason able study really fortunate.
folks WHOOP generous enough donate bunch WHOOP straps,
allowed us measure heart rate variability, number different
physiological parameters. also got subjective reports people's mood
feelings well-being. got data sleep pinged us remote locations.
people, rather brought laboratory artificial
circumstance, laboratory, much like think laboratory realistic--
virtual reality things like that-- nothing realistic real world.
able hundred subjects real world living
real lives pinging back us data time, 24 hours day measure
different interventions asked do, breathwork practices
meditation practices, impacting physiological parameters. also
informing us regularly subjective mood, et cetera. got lot data,
can imagine. basic takeaway study twofold. First all,
discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly
lead improvements focus memory, not much reductions stress, although
lead reductions stress. found number different
breathwork practices-- explored three-- done five minutes day outperformed
meditation terms ability breathwork reduce stress around clock
compared meditation. three types breathwork explored also showed
different effects. mention three types breathwork compared


box breathing sort just learned about. compare something
called cyclic sighing, involves two inhales nose get maximally
inflated lungs followed long exhale. return moment.
repeated five minutes time session. third breathwork practice,
cyclic hyperventilation, which, name suggests, involves people inhaling
deeply nose, exhaling passively mouth, repeating
inhale nose, exhale mouth, repeating 25 cycles, one
cycle inhale exhale. equals one cycle. Repeating 25
cycles, exhaling air holding breath lungs empty 15
30 seconds, repeating inhale, exhale, cyclic hyperventilation duration
five minutes. people divided different groups, either mindfulness
meditation sat, not told control breathing specific
way. closed eyes. focused attention region just behind
forehead. One group that. group cyclic sighing. Another group box
breathing. Another group cyclic hyperventilation. sort clinical trial like
to, swapped people different groups. served
control. evaluate within individual variability. Again,
lot data paper. takeaway sake stress reduction
around clock sake improving sleep mood, effective
practice four practices examined cyclic sighing. Again, cyclic
sighing performed following way. inhale nose deeply
can. second inhale immediately afterwards try maximally inflate
lungs. fact, happens. know second inhale, even
just sharp, short inhale, extra physical vigor required generate
second inhale causes alveoli lungs, may collapsed-- and,
indeed, breaths often even just course day
especially get stressed, alveoli lungs start collapse.
damp inside-- little bit fluid. like balloon
little bit fluid middle. takes little bit physical force pop open. Now,
not literally exploding pop. reinflating air.
perform long exhale mouth lungs empty. looks exactly like
this. [INHALES DEEPLY] [INHALES SHARPLY] [EXHALES] Now, know one
single physiological sigh sort just described performed time day
conditions, whether not walk stage give talk


meeting feeling stressed, conversation
stressful, can feel stress mounting traffic number
psychological physical stressors may approaching feel
oppressing you, one physiological sigh sort just described
fastest physiologically verified way aware reduce levels stress
reintroduce calm, is, shift autonomic nervous system state
heightened levels autonomic arousal. is, sympathetic nervous system as,
called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything
so-called fight flight, although controls things, too, including positive
arousal. parasympathetic nervous system, often referred rest
digest system, although things, too, associated calming. two
things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep
inhale, short second inhale also nose, long exhale completely
lungs empty, known restore level balance sympathetic-parasympathetic
neural circuitry fastest way reintroduce calm. one physiological sigh.
study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.
translated, again, sorts positive subjective changes-- improvements
sleep, lower resting heart rate times day. important. Again, study
not just exploring happens meditation breathwork, cyclic sighing, et
cetera. exploring changes occur practice translate
changes breathing heart rate, mood, et cetera, throughout 24-hour cycle.
takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress
reduction practice now supported data translate reductions stress
around clock, data say want invest cyclic sighing, is,
double inhale nose, extended exhale mouth lungs


empty, repeat five minutes day. You, course, like,
meditation. still positive effects, meaning reduced stress, although not much
cyclic sighing. box breathing want purpose reducing
stress. practices explored reduce stress. cyclic sighing performed
five minutes day robust pervasive effect reducing stress,
improving mood, improving sleep. first message study. second
takeaway one physiological sigh-- right just one physiological sigh,
inhale deeply nose another inhale nose maximally inflate
alveoli lungs, exhale completely lungs empty go
back normal breathing, fastest way introduce level calm reduce
overall levels stress real time. important. think
days, hear lot stress reduction techniques. stress
reduction techniques explored, everything massage meditation
breathwork hot shower foot rub, will calm down. question is,
calm just practice? Great does. also translate
reduced levels stress times 24-hour cycle positive effects
well? one physiological sigh efficient way adjust ratio sympathetic
parasympathetic activation immediately bring calm. excellent
real-time control stress. thing physiological sighs not
hack. not application breathing practice something wasn't intended
for. fact, physiological sighs not discovered all. discovered
physiologists

want much system. people, whether not asleep
awake, engage physiological sigh spontaneously, subconsciously.
double inhale nose extended exhale mouth.
not just eliminate excessive carbon dioxide system. also rebalanced
oxygen-carbon dioxide ratio proper ways. fact, observed animals.
might see animals tired. animals humans get tired, tend

called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, basis call heart rate variability.
Heart rate variability involves vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve,
parasympathetic nerve associated calming aspect autonomic

think people agree one hiccup sort funny.

01:46:21 Tool: Stop Hiccups

Two hiccups row really funny. three hiccups row starts
concerning, part hiccups can kind painful. can experience pain

Fortunately, simple way get rid hiccups. can arrive simple
technique understand little bit gives rise hiccups. reason
get hiccups experience spasm phrenic nerve. phrenic
nerve, recall, nerve emanates cervical region, specific C3,

Again, doesn't tend work lot time. people, works every time.
people, doesn't work all. However, technique can reliably
eliminate hiccups. technique takes advantage hypercontracting
phrenic nerve short period time subsequently relaxes
alleviates spasming phrenic nerve. simple method inhale three

big, deep inhale nose. exhale air, take second
inhale nose, however brief inhale might be, third even micro
millisecond long inhale nose get third inhale. hold
breath 15 20 seconds, slowly exhale. even though not

focused breathing techniques emphasize exhale,

01:51:17 Tool: Stress Management & Cyclic Hyperventilation, “Wim Hof Method”

whether not carbon dioxide tolerance test, whether not cyclic sighing
physiological sigh use real time reduce stress. One thing
haven't talked much cyclic hyperventilation. Cyclic hyperventilation,

showed people breathe nose, recognition

things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal

smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate

breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably

extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger

told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable

consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack

fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,

nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal

healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.


01:09:44 Tool: Train Healthy Breathing, Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test & Box Breathing

next, like address can normal patterns breathing,
is, anyone can adjust normal patterns breathing unhealthy


unhealthy state. first thing do, course, determine whether
not already breathing unhealthy healthy way. And, again,
say healthy unhealthy, mean, overbreathing? underbreathing?

seconds speaking, just going breathe normally. Now,
throughout episode, going encourage nasal breather
whenever possible. course, instances want engage
mouth breathing. time being, continue blab next
seconds, just inhale nose, exhale nose. don't
deliberately slow breathing increase cadence breathing. However,
time, also going want find sort time measuring device, like
phone stopwatch. going ask
minutes going ask inhale nose deeply possibly
can. is, going fill lungs much can nose.
start timer measure long takes deliberately control

deep inhale belly move inhale. say start,
going measure time takes complete lungs empty exhale.
fact, measure you. will one rare instances podcast
going long period silence measure something. got
stopwatch here. please prepare big inhale start inhaling now. inhale

start, meaning slowly control exhale nose. trying let air
slowly possible. just going call every 10 15 seconds so.
want note lungs empty. know can hold breath
lungs empty. not accurate measure. 15 seconds. important
note lungs empty trying control exhale much
possible don't arrive lungs empty time quickly. explain
quickly means. 30 seconds. OK, already reached lungs empty,
please go back breathing normally. haven't, can hang
little longer still discarding air. 45 seconds. rounding

still expelling air slow lungs-- slow exhale manner
nose. OK, just back envelope carbon dioxide discard rate
need pause go back try just want time long
takes go lungs full lungs empty, again, full understanding know
can sit like beasts hold breath lungs empty.
please don't not going informative telling
now. going tell now took 20 seconds less expel

air, is, control exhale 45 seconds 30 seconds,
moderate level carbon dioxide tolerance. if, instance,
able go 50 seconds longer discard hit lungs empty,
fairly high degree carbon dioxide tolerance. Now, deal. low
carbon dioxide tolerance, is, 20 seconds less, going write
number three. moderate levels carbon dioxide tolerance, going
write number five. even put five six.
bracket people able discard air period 50 seconds more,
going write number 8 10. OK? Now, numbers?
talking about? get numbers,
want emphasize again, not fitness level per se. know
world class triathletes fast carbon dioxide blow-off times. is,


discard rates 20 seconds less. also point stressed,

low, medium, high bracket number carbon dioxide discard rate. Remember,
low category, number three. medium, five six.
long carbon dioxide discard rate, long duration carbon dioxide discard
rate, is, 8 10 number. Now going two minutes
people call box breathing. box breathing? Box breathing equal
duration inhale, hold, exhale, hold, repeat. inhale, hold, exhale, hold. Sounds
easy, right? long inhale hold, exhale hold? Well, now
know. low group carbon dioxide discard rate, inhale going
three seconds, hold will three seconds, exhale will three seconds,
repeat, three seconds. side box, will, going

01:22:39 Tool: Breathwork & Stress Reduction; Cyclic Sighing

restore normal patterns breathing not overbreathe therefore not eliminate
much carbon dioxide exactly two tests incorporated study
laboratory collaboration associate chair psychiatry Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. David Spiegel, also guest podcast
previously. study explored box breathing. also explored forms
breathing actually compared forms deliberate breathing meditation
means explore going minimal effective doses effective
ways chronically reduce stress around clock improve mood improve
sleep. study referring just published recently. entitled "Brief
Structured Respiration Practices Enhance Mood Reduce Physiological Arousal."
will also provide link paper show note captions. study really
focused simple question, is, shortest effective
practice people can use order reduce levels stress not just


breathwork practice meditation practice around clock, 24 hours day,
including improvements sleep? excited study many
studies explored meditation or, cases, fewer studies explored
breathwork can impact different brain states bodily states. studies
explored breathwork meditation practices influenced body-brain states
around clock people not performing particular meditation
breathwork practice. reason able study really fortunate.
folks WHOOP generous enough donate bunch WHOOP straps,
allowed us measure heart rate variability, number different
physiological parameters. also got subjective reports people's mood
feelings well-being. got data sleep pinged us remote locations.
people, rather brought laboratory artificial
circumstance, laboratory, much like think laboratory realistic--
virtual reality things like that-- nothing realistic real world.
able hundred subjects real world living
real lives pinging back us data time, 24 hours day measure
different interventions asked do, breathwork practices
meditation practices, impacting physiological parameters. also
informing us regularly subjective mood, et cetera. got lot data,
can imagine. basic takeaway study twofold. First all,
discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly
lead improvements focus memory, not much reductions stress, although
lead reductions stress. found number different
breathwork practices-- explored three-- done five minutes day outperformed
meditation terms ability breathwork reduce stress around clock
compared meditation. three types breathwork explored also showed
different effects. mention three types breathwork compared


box breathing sort just learned about. compare something
called cyclic sighing, involves two inhales nose get maximally
inflated lungs followed long exhale. return moment.
repeated five minutes time session. third breathwork practice,
cyclic hyperventilation, which, name suggests, involves people inhaling
deeply nose, exhaling passively mouth, repeating
inhale nose, exhale mouth, repeating 25 cycles, one
cycle inhale exhale. equals one cycle. Repeating 25
cycles, exhaling air holding breath lungs empty 15
30 seconds, repeating inhale, exhale, cyclic hyperventilation duration
five minutes. people divided different groups, either mindfulness
meditation sat, not told control breathing specific
way. closed eyes. focused attention region just behind
forehead. One group that. group cyclic sighing. Another group box
breathing. Another group cyclic hyperventilation. sort clinical trial like
to, swapped people different groups. served
control. evaluate within individual variability. Again,
lot data paper. takeaway sake stress reduction
around clock sake improving sleep mood, effective
practice four practices examined cyclic sighing. Again, cyclic
sighing performed following way. inhale nose deeply
can. second inhale immediately afterwards try maximally inflate
lungs. fact, happens. know second inhale, even
just sharp, short inhale, extra physical vigor required generate
second inhale causes alveoli lungs, may collapsed-- and,
indeed, breaths often even just course day
especially get stressed, alveoli lungs start collapse.
damp inside-- little bit fluid. like balloon
little bit fluid middle. takes little bit physical force pop open. Now,
not literally exploding pop. reinflating air.
perform long exhale mouth lungs empty. looks exactly like
this. [INHALES DEEPLY] [INHALES SHARPLY] [EXHALES] Now, know one
single physiological sigh sort just described performed time day
conditions, whether not walk stage give talk


meeting feeling stressed, conversation
stressful, can feel stress mounting traffic number
psychological physical stressors may approaching feel
oppressing you, one physiological sigh sort just described
fastest physiologically verified way aware reduce levels stress
reintroduce calm, is, shift autonomic nervous system state
heightened levels autonomic arousal. is, sympathetic nervous system as,
called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything
so-called fight flight, although controls things, too, including positive
arousal. parasympathetic nervous system, often referred rest
digest system, although things, too, associated calming. two
things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep
inhale, short second inhale also nose, long exhale completely
lungs empty, known restore level balance sympathetic-parasympathetic
neural circuitry fastest way reintroduce calm. one physiological sigh.
study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.
translated, again, sorts positive subjective changes-- improvements
sleep, lower resting heart rate times day. important. Again, study
not just exploring happens meditation breathwork, cyclic sighing, et
cetera. exploring changes occur practice translate
changes breathing heart rate, mood, et cetera, throughout 24-hour cycle.
takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress
reduction practice now supported data translate reductions stress
around clock, data say want invest cyclic sighing, is,
double inhale nose, extended exhale mouth lungs


empty, repeat five minutes day. You, course, like,
meditation. still positive effects, meaning reduced stress, although not much
cyclic sighing. box breathing want purpose reducing
stress. practices explored reduce stress. cyclic sighing performed
five minutes day robust pervasive effect reducing stress,
improving mood, improving sleep. first message study. second
takeaway one physiological sigh-- right just one physiological sigh,
inhale deeply nose another inhale nose maximally inflate
alveoli lungs, exhale completely lungs empty go
back normal breathing, fastest way introduce level calm reduce
overall levels stress real time. important. think
days, hear lot stress reduction techniques. stress
reduction techniques explored, everything massage meditation
breathwork hot shower foot rub, will calm down. question is,
calm just practice? Great does. also translate
reduced levels stress times 24-hour cycle positive effects
well? one physiological sigh efficient way adjust ratio sympathetic
parasympathetic activation immediately bring calm. excellent
real-time control stress. thing physiological sighs not
hack. not application breathing practice something wasn't intended
for. fact, physiological sighs not discovered all. discovered
physiologists

anything happens around you-- car swerving front you, something
might detect periphery vision hear off distance-- increases
significantly compared exhaling. addition, inhaling,
ability remember things, especially things take bit effort remember,
ability learn new information significantly greater
exhaling. Now, hear that, probably thinking, OK, just inhale?
Well, course, not going best approach. need exhale well
reasons now well aware of. findings really illustrate--
mention findings carried humans. relate
stuff animal studies. just described shown human studies
consistently. inhale and, particular, inhale nose,
brain not functioning way exhale. Now, doesn't mean
brain functioning deficient way exhale. just doesn't function well
relates memory retrieval, memory formation, aspects

title paper "Nasal Respiration Entrains Human Limbic Oscillations
Modulates Cognitive Function." paper followed earlier paper
showed people breathe nose, recognition
discrimination different odors far greater breathe
mouth. Now, result interesting, also sort duh smell
things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal
inhalations versus nasal exhalations versus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.
basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal
noise talked earlier, recall, ability brain detect things
environment, increased inhalations. earlier study focused
smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate
variables. paper, one just mentioned, "Nasal Respiration Entrains
Human Limbic Oscillations Modulates Cognitive Function," not look
detection odors. Rather, looked things like reaction time fear. basically,
found reaction time greatly reduced people inhaling.
people look fearful stimuli. looked reaction time fearful stimuli,
words, ability detect certain kinds stimuli. given lot
different kinds stimuli. able discriminate one sort of--
oops, excuse me. way, folks, listening, just bumped microphone,
getting rather animated here. subjects detect one type
stimulus versus another stimulus exposed to. found
people inhaling fear-inducing stimulus presented, reaction
time notice much, much faster. related patterns brain
activity, able actually recording
brain directly beneath skull. able
patients intracranial electrodes embedded brain sake trying


detect epileptic seizures. lot study lot discuss.
basic takeaway people inhaling, is, drawing air
nose particular, ability detect going world
around greatly enhanced not just fear also surprise sorts.
people inhaling, ability detect novel stimuli, things unexpected
unusual environment, significantly increased. Again, put link
study well. find one interesting studies realm,
although now many additional studies support statement made
earlier, inhalation, also called inspiration, number
fast physiological changes, changes pupil diameter, changes activity
hippocampus, memory encoding retrieval area brain, areas
brain. tool takeaway this? sitting read
research study really want learn information-- maybe listening
podcast sorts information want retain-- actually makes
sense increase duration intensity inhales that.
inhaling relative exhaling terms duration, brain
focused mode mode able access retrieve information better.
Now, one caveat think important know number
people listen podcast sake gleaning tools not just cognitive enhancement
physical enhancement. turns inhaling air, actually
less able or, say, less efficient generating voluntary movements. Now,
might come surprise. now, basically talking inhalation
great, almost point wonder like, exhalation good anything?
don't want overbreathe kick much carbon dioxide. Well, course
exhalation great things. fact, somebody played baseball
softball, told? exhale swing generate
maximum amount power. somebody done martial arts kind,
traditional Western boxing, strike, people typically hiya,
laying sort classic karate type thing. movie thing. don't know
whether not people actually use hiya. boxing, oftentimes people will
[EXHALES SHARPLY].. rapid exhalation, forceful exhalation, keeping
mind, again, inhales typically active. engage diaphragmatic muscle.
engage intercostal muscles. Whereas exhales tend passive unless
take active control exhale. And, indeed, ability generate fast, directed, so-


called volitional, voluntary movements greatly enhanced
exhale, not inhale. Now, said, haven't yet really talked mouth
versus nasal breathing.

02:09:15 Mouth vs. Nasal Breathing, Aesthetics

really can fairly short discussion abundant data now show
beautifully described book called Jaws, Hidden Epidemic--

really striving breathe nose, not mouth.
relates increased resistance breathing nose talked earlier.
Again, say third time, increased resistance nose allows

favorable lung health breathing mouth. Hard breathing
mouth simply mouth breathing actually quite damaging can be,
say, quite damaging respiratory functions lungs. That, course,
not mean shouldn't breathe hard mouth running

us back question normal healthy breathing. mentioned before,
normal healthy breathing

01:03:53 Healthy Breathing?

breathing six liters air per minute. course, us don't think
terms liters air, not going measure lung capacity, least
us aren't going that. Basically, taking relatively shallow breaths
just sitting working maybe even walking slowly, again, not talking
engaging kind speech eating, chances six liters air per minute
12 shallowish breaths. say shallow, don't mean breathing [INHALES
SHALLOWLY] like little bunny rabbit something like that. just mean casually
breathing out, out. studies explored breathing patterns large
populations individuals not suffering necessarily one specific
ailment shown people breathe far much per minute,
engaging anywhere 15 20 even 30 shallow breaths per minute.
vastly overbreathing relative breathing. Now, course,
breathe deeply, take vigorous inhale [INHALES] expel
air, well, get six liters air system per minute, probably
going need somewhere four six breaths order get six liters per
minute. Now, total time takes inhale exhale isn't much
longer shallow breath, provided not deliberately breathing quickly
shallow breaths. say, well, normal healthy breathing
delivers appropriate amount carbon dioxide system doesn't expel,
doesn't exhale much carbon dioxide-- supposed normal
breathing? supposed breathe four times hold breath

greater air pressure going take longer exhale. already increasing


amount time breath going take. also find people
breathing proper healthy manner, is, balancing oxygen
carbon dioxide proper ways, also taking pauses breaths.
extremely important. even though brain center, pre-Botzinger
complex, can control or, say, control inhale-exhale rhythmic breathing,
pauses breaths not always present and, fact, often not present
people's baseline breathing patterns. consequence, overbreathe.
told before, people overbreathe, brain becomes hyperexcitable
level background noise. yet less efficient detecting learning
information. get specific studies really illustrate learning aspect
bit later. less efficient detecting learning information, focusing,
consequence overbreathing hyperexcitability causes.
Now, course, also just emphasizing effects overbreathing lack
carbon dioxide brain. hundreds, not thousands studies showing
don't enough carbon dioxide tissues body, also
problematic tissues-- liver, lungs themselves, stomach, et cetera--
relate largely shifts pH fact carbon dioxide strongly
regulates acidity, alkalinity blood tissues blood supplies
nutrients to, including carbon dioxide. basic takeaway want breathe
healthy manner rest. best way spend time--
doesn't take much, maybe minute day-- paying attention quickly
breathing per minute simply rest, making coffee
morning, sitting read, social media. Chronically
holding breath isn't good neither overbreathing. And, again, every study
examined typical patterns breathing patterns breathing show
normal abnormal found often not, nighttime, people
underbreathing. daytime, overbreathing. hyperventilating.

01:22:39 Tool: Breathwork & Stress Reduction; Cyclic Sighing

restore normal patterns breathing not overbreathe therefore not eliminate

can imagine. basic takeaway study twofold. First all,
discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly

called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything

things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep

study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced

takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress

title paper "Nasal Respiration Entrains Human Limbic Oscillations

showed people breathe nose, recognition

mouth. Now, result interesting, also sort duh smell
things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal
inhalations versus nasal exhalations versus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.
basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal
noise talked earlier, recall, ability brain detect things
environment, increased inhalations. earlier study focused
smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate
variables. paper, one just mentioned, "Nasal Respiration Entrains
Human Limbic Oscillations Modulates Cognitive Function," not look

found reaction time greatly reduced people inhaling.
people look fearful stimuli. looked reaction time fearful stimuli,

engage intercostal muscles. Whereas exhales tend passive unless
take active control exhale. And, indeed, ability generate fast, directed, so-


called volitional, voluntary movements greatly enhanced
exhale, not inhale. Now, said, haven't yet really talked mouth
versus nasal breathing.

carbon dioxide, is, well can control breathing mechanical
chemical level. simple test. going next 10
seconds speaking, just going breathe normally. Now,
throughout episode, going encourage nasal breather
whenever possible. course, instances want engage
mouth breathing. time being, continue blab next
seconds, just inhale nose, exhale nose. don't
deliberately slow breathing increase cadence breathing. However,
time, also going want find sort time measuring device, like
phone stopwatch. going ask
minutes going ask inhale nose deeply possibly
can. is, going fill lungs much can nose.
start timer measure long takes deliberately control
exhale lungs empty. going controlled exhale
nose big deep breath. time being, keep breathing kind calm,
regular cadence. can find time measuring device now, can come
back later like. say inhale, going inhale deeply can
nose, remembering diaphragm can really help get
deep inhale belly move inhale. say start,
going measure time takes complete lungs empty exhale.
fact, measure you. will one rare instances podcast
going long period silence measure something. got
stopwatch here. please prepare big inhale start inhaling now. inhale
deeply can nose. Fill lungs much can. OK? Now


start, meaning slowly control exhale nose. trying let air
slowly possible. just going call every 10 15 seconds so.
want note lungs empty. know can hold breath
lungs empty. not accurate measure. 15 seconds. important
note lungs empty trying control exhale much
possible don't arrive lungs empty time quickly. explain
quickly means. 30 seconds. OK, already reached lungs empty,
please go back breathing normally. haven't, can hang
little longer still discarding air. 45 seconds. rounding
toward minute, not quite there. probably still letting air. want
point none cardiovascular fitness level, least not

still expelling air slow lungs-- slow exhale manner
nose. OK, just back envelope carbon dioxide discard rate
need pause go back try just want time long
takes go lungs full lungs empty, again, full understanding know
can sit like beasts hold breath lungs empty.
please don't not going informative telling
now. going tell now took 20 seconds less expel
air, is, couldn't extend exhale longer 20 seconds, kind
back envelope way, can say relatively brief low carbon dioxide

air, is, control exhale 45 seconds 30 seconds,
moderate level carbon dioxide tolerance. if, instance,
able go 50 seconds longer discard hit lungs empty,
fairly high degree carbon dioxide tolerance. Now, deal. low
carbon dioxide tolerance, is, 20 seconds less, going write
number three. moderate levels carbon dioxide tolerance, going
write number five. even put five six.
bracket people able discard air period 50 seconds more,
going write number 8 10. OK? Now, numbers?
talking about? get numbers,
want emphasize again, not fitness level per se. know
world class triathletes fast carbon dioxide blow-off times. is,


discard rates 20 seconds less. also point stressed,

low, medium, high bracket number carbon dioxide discard rate. Remember,
low category, number three. medium, five six.
long carbon dioxide discard rate, long duration carbon dioxide discard
rate, is, 8 10 number. Now going two minutes
people call box breathing. box breathing? Box breathing equal
duration inhale, hold, exhale, hold, repeat. inhale, hold, exhale, hold. Sounds
easy, right? long inhale hold, exhale hold? Well, now
know. low group carbon dioxide discard rate, inhale going
three seconds, hold will three seconds, exhale will three seconds,
repeat, three seconds. side box, will, going

01:22:39 Tool: Breathwork & Stress Reduction; Cyclic Sighing

restore normal patterns breathing not overbreathe therefore not eliminate
much carbon dioxide exactly two tests incorporated study
laboratory collaboration associate chair psychiatry Stanford
School Medicine, Dr. David Spiegel, also guest podcast
previously. study explored box breathing. also explored forms
breathing actually compared forms deliberate breathing meditation
means explore going minimal effective doses effective
ways chronically reduce stress around clock improve mood improve
sleep. study referring just published recently. entitled "Brief
Structured Respiration Practices Enhance Mood Reduce Physiological Arousal."
will also provide link paper show note captions. study really
focused simple question, is, shortest effective
practice people can use order reduce levels stress not just


breathwork practice meditation practice around clock, 24 hours day,
including improvements sleep? excited study many
studies explored meditation or, cases, fewer studies explored
breathwork can impact different brain states bodily states. studies
explored breathwork meditation practices influenced body-brain states
around clock people not performing particular meditation
breathwork practice. reason able study really fortunate.
folks WHOOP generous enough donate bunch WHOOP straps,
allowed us measure heart rate variability, number different
physiological parameters. also got subjective reports people's mood
feelings well-being. got data sleep pinged us remote locations.
people, rather brought laboratory artificial
circumstance, laboratory, much like think laboratory realistic--
virtual reality things like that-- nothing realistic real world.
able hundred subjects real world living
real lives pinging back us data time, 24 hours day measure
different interventions asked do, breathwork practices
meditation practices, impacting physiological parameters. also
informing us regularly subjective mood, et cetera. got lot data,
can imagine. basic takeaway study twofold. First all,
discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing
daily 10 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,
memory, number things related cognition learning. However,
research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly
lead improvements focus memory, not much reductions stress, although
lead reductions stress. found number different
breathwork practices-- explored three-- done five minutes day outperformed
meditation terms ability breathwork reduce stress around clock
compared meditation. three types breathwork explored also showed
different effects. mention three types breathwork compared


box breathing sort just learned about. compare something
called cyclic sighing, involves two inhales nose get maximally
inflated lungs followed long exhale. return moment.
repeated five minutes time session. third breathwork practice,
cyclic hyperventilation, which, name suggests, involves people inhaling
deeply nose, exhaling passively mouth, repeating
inhale nose, exhale mouth, repeating 25 cycles, one
cycle inhale exhale. equals one cycle. Repeating 25
cycles, exhaling air holding breath lungs empty 15
30 seconds, repeating inhale, exhale, cyclic hyperventilation duration
five minutes. people divided different groups, either mindfulness
meditation sat, not told control breathing specific
way. closed eyes. focused attention region just behind
forehead. One group that. group cyclic sighing. Another group box
breathing. Another group cyclic hyperventilation. sort clinical trial like
to, swapped people different groups. served
control. evaluate within individual variability. Again,
lot data paper. takeaway sake stress reduction
around clock sake improving sleep mood, effective
practice four practices examined cyclic sighing. Again, cyclic
sighing performed following way. inhale nose deeply
can. second inhale immediately afterwards try maximally inflate
lungs. fact, happens. know second inhale, even
just sharp, short inhale, extra physical vigor required generate
second inhale causes alveoli lungs, may collapsed-- and,
indeed, breaths often even just course day
especially get stressed, alveoli lungs start collapse.
damp inside-- little bit fluid. like balloon
little bit fluid middle. takes little bit physical force pop open. Now,
not literally exploding pop. reinflating air.
perform long exhale mouth lungs empty. looks exactly like
this. [INHALES DEEPLY] [INHALES SHARPLY] [EXHALES] Now, know one
single physiological sigh sort just described performed time day
conditions, whether not walk stage give talk


meeting feeling stressed, conversation
stressful, can feel stress mounting traffic number
psychological physical stressors may approaching feel
oppressing you, one physiological sigh sort just described
fastest physiologically verified way aware reduce levels stress
reintroduce calm, is, shift autonomic nervous system state
heightened levels autonomic arousal. is, sympathetic nervous system as,
called, higher activation level so-called parasympathetic nervous system.
Again, sympathetic nervous system nothing sympathy, everything
so-called fight flight, although controls things, too, including positive
arousal. parasympathetic nervous system, often referred rest
digest system, although things, too, associated calming. two
things always kind push-pull one another, like seesaw push-pull,
however want think it. One physiological sigh, meaning big, deep
inhale, short second inhale also nose, long exhale completely
lungs empty, known restore level balance sympathetic-parasympathetic
neural circuitry fastest way reintroduce calm. one physiological sigh.
study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.
translated, again, sorts positive subjective changes-- improvements
sleep, lower resting heart rate times day. important. Again, study
not just exploring happens meditation breathwork, cyclic sighing, et
cetera. exploring changes occur practice translate
changes breathing heart rate, mood, et cetera, throughout 24-hour cycle.
takeaway twofold. First all, somebody wants improve
mood reduce overall levels stress five minutes day
invest that, hopefully things like trying get proper sleep
exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera, sunlight morning, course.
Can't leave out. going devote five minutes day stress
reduction practice now supported data translate reductions stress
around clock, data say want invest cyclic sighing, is,
double inhale nose, extended exhale mouth lungs


empty, repeat five minutes day. You, course, like,
meditation. still positive effects, meaning reduced stress, although not much
cyclic sighing. box breathing want purpose reducing
stress. practices explored reduce stress. cyclic sighing performed
five minutes day robust pervasive effect reducing stress,
improving mood, improving sleep. first message study. second
takeaway one physiological sigh-- right just one physiological sigh,
inhale deeply nose another inhale nose maximally inflate
alveoli lungs, exhale completely lungs empty go
back normal breathing, fastest way introduce level calm reduce
overall levels stress real time. important. think
days, hear lot stress reduction techniques. stress
reduction techniques explored, everything massage meditation
breathwork hot shower foot rub, will calm down. question is,
calm just practice? Great does. also translate
reduced levels stress times 24-hour cycle positive effects
well? one physiological sigh efficient way adjust ratio sympathetic
parasympathetic activation immediately bring calm. excellent
real-time control stress. thing physiological sighs not
hack. not application breathing practice something wasn't intended
for. fact, physiological sighs not discovered all. discovered

01:39:16 Breathing & Heart Rate Variability

organs neighborhood, talk relationship
breathing heart rate. incredibly important topic, much
perhaps brought beginning episode. nonetheless,
now know diaphragm does. inhale, diaphragm moves down.
right. contract diaphragm, moves down. creates space
lungs inhale. exhale, diaphragm moves up. Well, inhale
diaphragm moves down, happens space created


thoracic cavity particularly also breathing deeply using
intercostal muscles expand ribs. consequence, heart actually gets
little bit bigger. temporary enlargement heart. real enlargement.
consequence, whatever blood heart now larger volume
heart got bigger. consequence, blood moving slowly

reduce volume heart overall, blood flow heart
accelerates smaller volume. given unit blood going move
quickly small volume. nervous system detects sends

heart rate down. Now, course, even though can double inhales even
triple inhales, sooner later, inhale, going exhale.
converse also true, course. mean terms controlling
heart rate? Well, say going blood draw, going stage

physiological sighs bring level calm level stress down.
Nonetheless, reason want quickly reduce heart rate

additionally, not just use physiological sigh, well, can take advantage
relationship inhales exhales controlling heart rate. want increase
heart rate, can simply inhale longer vigorously relative
exhales. want decrease heart rate, well, going make
exhales longer and/or vigorous inhales. fact, process,
called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, basis call heart rate variability.
Heart rate variability involves vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve,
parasympathetic nerve associated calming aspect autonomic
nervous system, slowing heart rate extending exhales. really
forms basis breathing practices. look breathing practices,

exhale really terrific skill master, easy skill master, frankly.
say skill? Well, remember said earlier, humans inhale actively


typically will passively exhale, just let air [EXHALES] drop

think people agree one hiccup sort funny.

01:46:21 Tool: Stop Hiccups

Two hiccups row really funny. three hiccups row starts
concerning, part hiccups can kind painful. can experience pain
gut lower abdomen sometimes chest well. feels kind

Fortunately, simple way get rid hiccups. can arrive simple
technique understand little bit gives rise hiccups. reason
get hiccups experience spasm phrenic nerve. phrenic
nerve, recall, nerve emanates cervical region, specific C3,

Again, doesn't tend work lot time. people, works every time.
people, doesn't work all. However, technique can reliably
eliminate hiccups. technique takes advantage hypercontracting
phrenic nerve short period time subsequently relaxes
alleviates spasming phrenic nerve. simple method inhale three

big, deep inhale nose. exhale air, take second
inhale nose, however brief inhale might be, third even micro
millisecond long inhale nose get third inhale. hold
breath 15 20 seconds, slowly exhale. even though not

title paper "Nasal Respiration Entrains Human Limbic Oscillations
Modulates Cognitive Function." paper followed earlier paper
showed people breathe nose, recognition
discrimination different odors far greater breathe
mouth. Now, result interesting, also sort duh smell
things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal
inhalations versus nasal exhalations versus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.
basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal
noise talked earlier, recall, ability brain detect things
environment, increased inhalations. earlier study focused
smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate
variables. paper, one just mentioned, "Nasal Respiration Entrains
Human Limbic Oscillations Modulates Cognitive Function," not look
detection odors. Rather, looked things like reaction time fear. basically,
found reaction time greatly reduced people inhaling.
people look fearful stimuli. looked reaction time fearful stimuli,
words, ability detect certain kinds stimuli. given lot
different kinds stimuli. able discriminate one sort of--
oops, excuse me. way, folks, listening, just bumped microphone,
getting rather animated here. subjects detect one type

people inhaling fear-inducing stimulus presented, reaction
time notice much, much faster. related patterns brain

detect epileptic seizures. lot study lot discuss.
basic takeaway people inhaling, is, drawing air
nose particular, ability detect going world
around greatly enhanced not just fear also surprise sorts.
people inhaling, ability detect novel stimuli, things unexpected
unusual environment, significantly increased. Again, put link
study well. find one interesting studies realm,
although now many additional studies support statement made
earlier, inhalation, also called inspiration, number

Now, one caveat think important know number
people listen podcast sake gleaning tools not just cognitive enhancement
physical enhancement. turns inhaling air, actually
less able or, say, less efficient generating voluntary movements. Now,
might come surprise. now, basically talking inhalation
great, almost point wonder like, exhalation good anything?
don't want overbreathe kick much carbon dioxide. Well, course
exhalation great things. fact, somebody played baseball
softball, told? exhale swing generate
maximum amount power. somebody done martial arts kind,

engage intercostal muscles. Whereas exhales tend passive unless
take active control exhale. And, indeed, ability generate fast, directed, so-


called volitional, voluntary movements greatly enhanced
exhale, not inhale. Now, said, haven't yet really talked mouth
versus nasal breathing.

discovered deliberate breathwork practices done five minutes per day
across course month led greater reductions stress five
minute day meditation practice. Now, not say meditation not useful.
fact, dozens, not hundreds, papers, including one particular, say,
particularly beautiful study Wendy Suzuki's lab New York University showing

research meditation shown us meditation, least short meditations, mainly

study, asked people perform repeatedly, so-called cyclic
sighing, duration five minutes. people cyclic sighing
five minutes day, regardless time day it, experienced
greatest reductions stress not just practice around 24-hour cycle.

showed people breathe nose, recognition

things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal
inhalations versus nasal exhalations versus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.
basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal
noise talked earlier, recall, ability brain detect things
environment, increased inhalations. earlier study focused
smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate

found reaction time greatly reduced people inhaling.
people look fearful stimuli. looked reaction time fearful stimuli,

showed people breathe nose, recognition

things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal

environment, increased inhalations. earlier study focused
smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate

called volitional, voluntary movements greatly enhanced
exhale, not inhale. Now, said, haven't yet really talked mouth

showed people breathe nose, recognition

things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal

smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate

Now, one caveat think important know number

called volitional, voluntary movements greatly enhanced
exhale, not inhale. Now, said, haven't yet really talked mouth

nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal

nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal

mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal

smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate

01:39:16 Breathing & Heart Rate Variability

organs neighborhood, talk relationship
breathing heart rate. incredibly important topic, much
perhaps brought beginning episode. nonetheless,
now know diaphragm does. inhale, diaphragm moves down.
right. contract diaphragm, moves down. creates space
lungs inhale. exhale, diaphragm moves up. Well, inhale
diaphragm moves down, happens space created


thoracic cavity particularly also breathing deeply using
intercostal muscles expand ribs. consequence, heart actually gets
little bit bigger. temporary enlargement heart. real enlargement.
consequence, whatever blood heart now larger volume
heart got bigger. consequence, blood moving slowly
larger volume short period time. nonetheless, moving slowly.
nervous system detects sends neural signal heart speed heart
rate up. words, inhales increase heart rate. opposite true
exhale. exhale, diaphragm moves up. rib cage tends move
inward bit. compact heart. reduce volume heart overall.
reduce volume heart overall, blood flow heart
accelerates smaller volume. given unit blood going move
quickly small volume. nervous system detects sends
signal slow heart down. just inhales speed heart up, exhales slow
heart rate down. Now, course, even though can double inhales even
triple inhales, sooner later, inhale, going exhale.
converse also true, course. mean terms controlling
heart rate? Well, say going blood draw, going stage
stressed. Well, encourage physiological sigh, maybe two
physiological sighs bring level calm level stress down.
Nonetheless, reason want quickly reduce heart rate
accelerate heart rate sake physical work output calm
additionally, not just use physiological sigh, well, can take advantage
relationship inhales exhales controlling heart rate. want increase
heart rate, can simply inhale longer vigorously relative
exhales. want decrease heart rate, well, going make
exhales longer and/or vigorous inhales. fact, process,
called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, basis call heart rate variability.
Heart rate variability involves vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve,
parasympathetic nerve associated calming aspect autonomic
nervous system, slowing heart rate extending exhales. really
forms basis breathing practices. look breathing practices,
whether not Wim Hof breathing, Tummo breathing, Kundalini breathing,
Pranayama breathing, physiological sighing, cyclic sighing, on,


measure ratio inhales exhales vigor inhales exhales,
find one create net increase net decrease heart

box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold is,
definition, creating equal duration inhales exhales essentially equivalent vigor.
physiological sigh, two big inhales, going speed

going lead increases heart rate. relationship breathing heart
rate absolutely lockstep one heart rate follows breathing.
heart rate breathing intimate discussion one another,
always forever inhales increase heart rate, exhales decrease it. Now,
feature, physicians call respiratory sinus arrhythmia, sometimes hear
often nowadays heart rate variability, something people sport
known long time. why, instance, marksmen will exhale
just prior taking shot. particularly true people compete biathlon,
cross country ski. heart rate up, up, up, up, up. get
point actually shoot target, exhale,
shoot target. also why, instance, want bring heart rate
quickly rounds martial arts, number different ways
that. extended exhale kind or, frankly, breathing practice
emphasizes exhales going bring heart rate down. incorporated
number different contexts, including sport, military. also now
incorporated clinical context people feel panic attack coming on.
gratified learn physiological sigh now explored tool prevent

exhale really terrific skill master, easy skill master, frankly.
say skill? Well, remember said earlier, humans inhale actively


typically will passively exhale, just let air [EXHALES] drop

things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal

showed people breathe nose, recognition

nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal

now know diaphragm does. inhale, diaphragm moves down.
right. contract diaphragm, moves down. creates space
lungs inhale. exhale, diaphragm moves up. Well, inhale
diaphragm moves down, happens space created


thoracic cavity particularly also breathing deeply using
intercostal muscles expand ribs. consequence, heart actually gets

heart rate down. Now, course, even though can double inhales even
triple inhales, sooner later, inhale, going exhale.
converse also true, course. mean terms controlling
heart rate? Well, say going blood draw, going stage

physiological sighs bring level calm level stress down.
Nonetheless, reason want quickly reduce heart rate

additionally, not just use physiological sigh, well, can take advantage
relationship inhales exhales controlling heart rate. want increase
heart rate, can simply inhale longer vigorously relative
exhales. want decrease heart rate, well, going make
exhales longer and/or vigorous inhales. fact, process,
called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, basis call heart rate variability.
Heart rate variability involves vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve,
parasympathetic nerve associated calming aspect autonomic
nervous system, slowing heart rate extending exhales. really
forms basis breathing practices. look breathing practices,

feature, physicians call respiratory sinus arrhythmia, sometimes hear
often nowadays heart rate variability, something people sport

title paper "Nasal Respiration Entrains Human Limbic Oscillations

showed people breathe nose, recognition

things nose, not mouth. taste things mouth, speak
mouth, bunch things can mouth.
nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal
inhalations versus nasal exhalations versus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.
basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal
noise talked earlier, recall, ability brain detect things
environment, increased inhalations. earlier study focused
smell, olfaction, bit confound there. hard separate

beautifully described book called Jaws, Hidden Epidemic--
book written Paul Ehrlich Sandra Kahn, colleagues Stanford
School Medicine. introduction foreword Jared Diamond
great Robert Sapolsky. real heavy hitters book. book
really describes whenever possible, meaning unless speaking eating
exercising activities require change pattern breathing,
really striving breathe nose, not mouth.
relates increased resistance breathing nose talked earlier.
Again, say third time, increased resistance nose allows
inflate lungs more, not less. thing breathing nose allows
warms moisturizes air bring lungs,
favorable lung health breathing mouth. Hard breathing
mouth simply mouth breathing actually quite damaging can be,
say, quite damaging respiratory functions lungs. That, course,
not mean shouldn't breathe hard mouth running
sprinting exercising hard. don't want mouth breathing chronic
default pattern follow. Nasal breathing (Nasal Strips) best pattern
breathing follow default state. Another aspect nasal breathing really
beneficial gas nitric oxide actually created nasal passages. gas
can cause relaxation smooth muscles relate vasculature not just
nose brain tissues body. nasal
breathing not mouth breathing great want relieve congestion.
lot things seem counterintuitive. nose stuffed. mainly makes
people breathe mouth. turns breathing nose will

Jaws, Hidden Epidemic, terrific read. also shows absolutely striking
pictures, twin studies forth, afters people
aesthetic changes experienced shifted mouth breather
nose breather. striking examples observed
again. people mouth breath, elongation jaw, drooping
eyelids, entire jaw structure really changes ways not aesthetically
favorable. Fortunately, people switch becoming nasal breathers-- and,
course, takes encouragement either mouth taping

fortunately, mentioned earlier, nasal breathe, is, deliberately nasal

changes facial structure occur people move mouth nasal breathing,
really quite striking. today's episode, per always, covered lot
information. First, talked mechanical aspects breathing-- lungs,


diaphragm, trachea, forth. also talked chemical aspects
breathing, really breathing way bring oxygen cells get
correct levels or, say, maintain correct levels carbon dioxide
system, neither much little, order allow oxygen magic
allow carbon dioxide magic. learned today's episode,
carbon dioxide not just waste byproduct. critical physiological functions.
need enough around. therefore, don't want overbreathe,
especially rest. talked tool measure well manage carbon

use simply breathing decrease stress real time, decrease stress
chronically around clock. Obviously, good thing-- improve sleep, improve
mood. increase breath hold times might want that. Also
eliminate hiccups. talked breathe order eliminate side stitch
side cramp might experience exercise breathe order
improve learning memory, reaction time, various aspects cognitive

nonetheless, study pointed idea brain different nasal

basically showed brain ramps levels activity, signal
