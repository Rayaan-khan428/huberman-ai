enter code Huberman save 20% first order. Again, ROKA,
roka.com, enter code Huberman checkout. Okay, talk heat,
specifically, talk biology heat heating health benefits
tools related heat heating. first question answer
heat up? answer question heat two ways. heat
outside, meaning things come contact with, clothing put
body, whether not heat room, whether not cold outside
cold room, heat inside. body capacity generate
heat cool down, meaning turn off heating process, can
ways match external environment. simplest way think
actually two body temperatures. People will say, "Oh, body


temperature? "98.6." actually not true. Body temperature varies
individuals. varies across time day within individuals. every point across
entire lifespan, two distinct temperatures. One temperature skin,
scientists call shell, temperature core, viscera, meaning
organs, nervous system, spinal cord. can imagine,
temperature core always higher temperature surface.
important thing know temperature shell temperature
core. Now don't need know exactly temperatures
cases, vitally important understand two temperatures
brain constantly sending signals body whether not
heat cool down, depending temperature shell, makes
total sense. lot like thermostat room, essentially paying attention
cold hot is, sending signals heating cooling system
either heat environment cool environment, depending
temperature environment. brain neurons send signals cells
body deploy release chemicals brain body heat
cold cool hot. So, can
understand two body temperatures, one shell, surface,
one core, inside, body brain always trying balance
two temperatures appropriate way, well halfway understanding
biology thermal regulation heating, lot along
understanding specific tools can used improve metabolism improve
cognition, instance. fact, later will learn one way can heat
cooling surface body. right. throw cold towel, ice
cold towel, onto torso right now ask you, "Well, feel?" say,
"Oh, cold, chilly." However, brain acting like bit
thermostat surface, shell body felt cool, make sense
thermostat activate biological mechanisms heat core. Similarly,
put hot environment, say, "Oh, wow, really, really
warm here," brain body go lot effort activate
mechanisms cool down. anytime talking heat, meaning deliberate
heat exposure, things like sauna, important understand, not just stimulus,
hot something is, long sauna, et cetera, effect
shell core. can understand can design protocols


literally perfect goals. final point this, want develop
best tools,

00:13:28 Thermal Regulation, Hyperthermia

instance, heat stimulus, sauna, afterward.
Everything biology process. soon learn, specific sauna

engages switch, process, compounds, builds itself, increase
growth hormone further. fact, just get sauna
long period time crank temperature match exact temperature

really transition hot cool temperatures engage process
heating reheating again. So, today going learn use
sauna. going learn use heat-related tools health
optimization, not just growth hormone, also metabolic health, controlling
cortisol, even impact mental health positive ways. order that, need
understand little bit mechanisms heat cool
down, cells circuits brain body, cells circuits
work. promise make description follows clear, even don't
background biology. hand, along
understanding now fact got shell core,
need think shell core, well, will best possible
position use sauna hot tub tools, even just hot shower, powerful
stimulus optimize biology. Now, science heat heating cold
cooling, matter, goes back well hundred years. fact, kind amusing
nowadays kind renewed interest use heat cold
science heat cold, first topic studied


undergraduate. fact, graduate thesis thermal regulation.
time, thermal regulation wasn't really considered one hot topics neuroscience.
People focused things like memory consciousness. course
topics still vital interest many people many laboratories, thermal
regulation considered thing physiologists. Nowadays, not just
social media, not just landscape biohackers athletes, landscape
mental health, frankly, general ethos around health optimization, people
really interested heat cold. reason interested heat cold
lot science done animal models mice humans
translates immediately protocols anyone can use. Now, brief warning now
another brief warning later, anytime talking heating body,
need cautious, unlike cooling down, fairly broad
range cold temperatures can go damaging tissue, well,
don't get heat brain body much start getting realm
neuron damage, neuron's central nervous system, brain spinal
cord, damaged don't come back. hyperthermia serious thing
avoid. Later talk ways rapidly protect hyperthermia, want
give everybody cautionary note front. Obviously, pregnant, nursing,
sensitive hot environments, want stay saunas things
sort. sure exceptions that. definitely talk doctor
going violate rule. everybody, want approach kind
tool related heating cautiously. always opportunity increase
temperature later. proceed caution.

00:26:30 Protocols & Benefits Deliberate Heat Exposure

understand rest information tools follow. Next, like talk


use deliberate heat exposure, including sauna, tools well,
way understand heat heating changes biology. So, going learn
mechanism going learn tools. first like just
emphasize use deliberate heat exposure can powerful way
improve health longevity. wonderful study published
2018 includes lot data lot participants, lot different conditions,
instance, people sauna versus two three times week versus
four seven times week on, compares those. title study
Sauna Bathing Associated Reduced Cardiovascular Mortality Improves Risk
Prediction Men Women Prospective Cohort Study. one several papers
clearly demonstrate regular use sauna forms deliberate heat
exposure can reduce mortality cardiovascular events, also events, things
like stroke things basically can kill us. like much
related studies, yes, will provide link show notes,
involve lot participants. instance, particular paper, published
BMC Medicine, looked sample 1,688 participants mean age
63, range ages around 63, 51.4% women. rest
men. pretty nicely varied study terms populations looked
at. basically found often people sauna, better
health lower likelihood will die sort cardiovascular
event. mean sauna? need define parameters around
sauna, promise provide alternative ways access health
benefits observed related studies without need sauna,
'cause realize lot people don't access sauna. First off,
temperature ranges used pretty much studies going
talk about, unless say otherwise, 80 degrees Celsius, meaning 176
degrees Fahrenheit, 100 degrees Celsius, meaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
somewhere range. hot make sauna environment
get decide use tools? Well, will depend
tolerance heat, heat adapted are. Yes, people better sweating
others. time get better sweating. Meaning go
sauna frequently, become better sweater, not sweater wear,
verb sweater, get better sweating, dumping heat loss water.
going depend. recommend starting lower end temperature scale,


hot even lower temperature further. Now, long
people exposing hot environments? Anywhere five 20
minutes per session. soon learn, brief periods just five minutes
heat exposure can powerful stimulus heat exposure significantly great
enough you. 20 minutes can also beneficial, 80 100 degrees Celsius,
meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit general range
studies use. particular study, compared effects people
sauna week, two three times per week, four seven times per
week. saw really remarkable. observed people
went sauna two three times per week 27% less likely die
cardiovascular event people went sauna just week,
temperature levels duration talked earlier. can imagine,
duration, temperature levels related. people went hot
environments really uncomfortable them, maybe went five
minutes. Whereas, comfortable heat adapted given
environment tolerance heat just simply higher whatever reason, well
tended stay longer. can take sort average five 20 minute
range, today mainly going talk exposures 10 20 minutes
temperatures between, again, 80 degrees 100 degrees Celsius, 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 212 degrees Fahrenheit. data point fact going
sauna two three times per week really beneficial can lower mortality
cardiovascular events. fact, benefits even greater people
going sauna four seven times per week. people 50% less likely
die cardiovascular event compared people went sauna just
week. really impressive, frankly, encouraging studies. Certainly
caught eye encouraged start using deliberate heat exposure regular
basis. particularly nice study, related study that, again,
linked show notes, looked number potentially confounding
variables, things like whether not people smoked, things like whether not people
overweight, whether not tended exercise not exercise,
able separate variables. percentages described earlier, 27%
less likely die cardiovascular event went sauna two three
times week 50% less likely die cardiovascular event went
sauna four times per week, compared just week. effects really


seem consequence sauna exposure not effect
correlated sauna exposure, like going gym people working
seven times week also happen get sauna, quitting smoking right
time adopt sauna protocol, sorts things. now
additional analyses use sauna improving health, say
offsetting mortality, found not just reductions cardiovascular
events, called all-cause mortality. kind medical geek speak saying,
likely somebody die cardiovascular event, maybe also
event, health-related event, like cancer something
sort. every case, regular exposure sauna starting two three times
per week, way seven times per week, greatly improves, meaning statistically
significant improvements longevity sense people less likely die
cardiovascular events things kill us. many people
interested not just health, educating health-related tools

00:33:37 Tools & Conditions Deliberate Heat Exposure

general public, find really exciting. knowing know heat
impacts biology, probably shouldn't surprise us sauna type exposure
deliberate heat exposure incredible effects. get
biological mechanisms heat can impressive health effects, want
just talk use sauna tool emphasize don't use
sauna order get benefits. simply matter making sure shell
core heat properly bit, not much, not little, heat
up. no, not need carry thermometer around place thermometer
core. laboratory studies humans, really want know someone's
core temperature, basically try put thermal probe close core
can. typically done rectally mouth thermometer even nose.
don't need that. isn't laboratory study. ways create hot

infrared saunas, hot tubs, simply rooms crank


heat. also ways can increase shell core
temperature moving around lot wearing lot clothing.
nothing special one approaches protocols. just happens
sauna one convenient ways this. certainly studies
talked about, not just ones referenced before, studies
researched looking episode, makes sense use sauna,
hard, instance, create conditions five people go
jogging, wearing heavy sweaters hats, wool hats middle summer,
hard set conditions way controlled everybody. Whereas,
pretty straightforward sauna one several people just get

course careful, hydrate don't overheat. Don't become excessively hyperthermic,
'cause can get heat stroke can potentially die. going use

Another set positive effects related hot environments hormone

those, want talk context underlying mechanisms,
understand underlying mechanisms, can really tailor
sauna protocols particular needs. One dramatic important
effects going hot environment period time activation so-
called heat shock proteins, HSPs. Heat shock proteins protective mechanism
brain body rescue proteins otherwise misfold. mean
this? Well, familiar fact protein kitchen, like
steak piece chicken piece fish, heat up, changes texture.

least short term, activating heat shock proteins good thing. don't want
heat shock proteins activated long periods time, gets
problematic reasons. heat shock proteins, many
varieties, basically job traveling brain body making sure
cells contain proteins misfolding got heated much,
don't misfold, also, sort protective mechanism, making sure proteins
within cells brain body don't fold wrong ways. Again, describing
general terms, well established animal models humans,
sauna exposure sort described earlier activates heat shock proteins.
interesting studies carried animal models really nicely
mechanistically support role heat shock proteins benefits
deliberate heat exposure. studies done flies, meaning Drosophila,
fruit flies, 'cause great model organism, can delete genes add
genes easily. studies done mice. now also studies
carried humans, will talk those. One dramatic
examples always touted field deliberate heat exposure relates
longevity expose flies, fruit flies 70 minutes heat

extend life 15% heat shock dependent way. Meaning made flies
didn't heat shock proteins, well didn't see extension life.

Effects Repeated Sauna Bathing." paper published 1986,
years ago, nonetheless serves basis lot studies
followed. let describe study. used 80 degree Celsius
environment, 176 degrees Fahrenheit, subjects sauna
30 minutes, four times per day. two hours total one day, 30 minutes
sauna, period cool rest, 30 minutes sauna again, cool rest, third,
fourth time. So, two hours total 80 degree Celsius environment.
lot, observed really quite significant. subjects
protocol, mention male female subjects study,
entire study lasted week. two hours sauna exposure day one,
day three, day seven week. measured lot different hormones,
cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroid hormone itself, luteinizing hormone,
follicle stimulating hormone, hormones essentially drive production
hormones. won't get deeply, like learn FSH,
follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, please see episode
optimizing testosterone estrogen hubermanlab.com. looked prolactin
looked growth hormone. just cut chase tell effects
growth hormone. subjects two hour day, 80 degree Celsius protocol
experienced 16-fold increases growth hormone. measured growth hormone
sauna sauna growth hormone levels went 16 fold,
obviously enormous, turns statistically significant, effect. Now, one
important caveat here. Remember earlier talked people sauna


week versus two three times week versus four seven times week,
often people sauna, less likely die cardiovascular events
things sort? Well, case, effects sauna exposure growth
hormone actually went often people deliberate heat
exposure. mentioned, two hour day divided 30 minute
sessions protocol day one, day three, day seven week. found
day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared
sauna, effect basically cut two thirds. now instead getting 16-fold
increase, like three four-fold increase, still huge increase,
not great increase observed day one. day seven, tended
two, maybe threefold increase, not great one observed day
one. mean? happen? Well, reason happens
heat, just like cold, shock stressor system. context cold,
get cold ice bath, instance, five-degree ice bath, even 20
seconds, known increase norepinephrine 200%. can double amount
norepinephrine suddenly release brain body, actually can
positive effects. talk little bit,
every day, become cold adapted. circuit compares shelling core
body adjust ways either predict cold stimulus,
likely create thermogenetic mechanisms preparation cold exposure.
why, instance, people use deliberate cold exposure try increase
lipolysis, burning fat, oftentimes will get results while,
lot, lot, stop getting effects. talk lot avoiding cold adaptation,
goal, episode cold, similar mechanisms play here.
imagine subjects got sauna day one, whatever
pathways went measurement temperature shell changes temperature
core led big increases growth hormone, basically way just
describing result already told before. fact result diminished

think latter explanation far likely. much akin weight

lungs burning heaving breathing hard, first day,
painful thing. every day every day, provided allow
recover, pretty soon running hill not breathing
hard. isn't much burning muscles, et cetera, et cetera. body

exposure going use order try trigger massive increases
growth hormone, going need careful not than,
say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean
discouraging using deliberate heat exposure access growth hormone increases,
specific goal main goal, think reasonable say
don't want deliberate heat exposure, least not sort described here,
week, maybe even every 10 days, want
time events life, maybe hard workouts, trying push
fat loss barrier simply order access growth hormone peak levels,
maybe three times per month four times per month. start deliberate heat

nearly large increases growth hormone

01:04:32 Parameters Heat & Cold Exposure

might say, wait, episode heat heating, not cold,
really can't conversation heat heating without talking cold.
Because, mentioned earlier, cool outside body, shell,
actually heating body. fact, circuits control heating body
control cooling body, instance, activation things like shiver fat loss

cause 200 300% increase norepinephrine. Norepinephrine also called
noradrenaline. norepinephrine so-called catacholamines like dopamine
increased dramatically brief cold water exposure. increases
norepinephrine dopamine known long-lasting effects generally lead
improvements mood, focus, alertness. pretty significant. However,
aren't significant enough increase metabolism high degree. Whereas,
studies shown people go outside 16 degree Celsius weather

use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.

roka.com, enter code Huberman checkout. Okay, talk heat,
specifically, talk biology heat heating health benefits
tools related heat heating. first question answer
heat up? answer question heat two ways. heat
outside, meaning things come contact with, clothing put
body, whether not heat room, whether not cold outside
cold room, heat inside. body capacity generate
heat cool down, meaning turn off heating process, can
ways match external environment. simplest way think
actually two body temperatures. People will say, "Oh, body


temperature? "98.6." actually not true. Body temperature varies
individuals. varies across time day within individuals. every point across
entire lifespan, two distinct temperatures. One temperature skin,
scientists call shell, temperature core, viscera, meaning
organs, nervous system, spinal cord. can imagine,
temperature core always higher temperature surface.
important thing know temperature shell temperature
core. Now don't need know exactly temperatures
cases, vitally important understand two temperatures
brain constantly sending signals body whether not
heat cool down, depending temperature shell, makes
total sense. lot like thermostat room, essentially paying attention
cold hot is, sending signals heating cooling system
either heat environment cool environment, depending
temperature environment. brain neurons send signals cells
body deploy release chemicals brain body heat
cold cool hot. So, can
understand two body temperatures, one shell, surface,
one core, inside, body brain always trying balance
two temperatures appropriate way, well halfway understanding
biology thermal regulation heating, lot along
understanding specific tools can used improve metabolism improve
cognition, instance. fact, later will learn one way can heat
cooling surface body. right. throw cold towel, ice
cold towel, onto torso right now ask you, "Well, feel?" say,
"Oh, cold, chilly." However, brain acting like bit
thermostat surface, shell body felt cool, make sense
thermostat activate biological mechanisms heat core. Similarly,
put hot environment, say, "Oh, wow, really, really
warm here," brain body go lot effort activate
mechanisms cool down. anytime talking heat, meaning deliberate
heat exposure, things like sauna, important understand, not just stimulus,
hot something is, long sauna, et cetera, effect
shell core. can understand can design protocols

sauna. going learn use heat-related tools health
optimization, not just growth hormone, also metabolic health, controlling
cortisol, even impact mental health positive ways. order that, need
understand little bit mechanisms heat cool

understanding now fact got shell core,
need think shell core, well, will best possible
position use sauna hot tub tools, even just hot shower, powerful

cooling, matter, goes back well hundred years. fact, kind amusing
nowadays kind renewed interest use heat cold
science heat cold, first topic studied


undergraduate. fact, graduate thesis thermal regulation.
time, thermal regulation wasn't really considered one hot topics neuroscience.
People focused things like memory consciousness. course
topics still vital interest many people many laboratories, thermal
regulation considered thing physiologists. Nowadays, not just
social media, not just landscape biohackers athletes, landscape
mental health, frankly, general ethos around health optimization, people
really interested heat cold. reason interested heat cold
lot science done animal models mice humans
translates immediately protocols anyone can use. Now, brief warning now
another brief warning later, anytime talking heating body,
need cautious, unlike cooling down, fairly broad
range cold temperatures can go damaging tissue, well,
don't get heat brain body much start getting realm
neuron damage, neuron's central nervous system, brain spinal
cord, damaged don't come back. hyperthermia serious thing
avoid. Later talk ways rapidly protect hyperthermia, want
give everybody cautionary note front. Obviously, pregnant, nursing,
sensitive hot environments, want stay saunas things
sort. sure exceptions that. definitely talk doctor
going violate rule. everybody, want approach kind
tool related heating cautiously. always opportunity increase

00:26:30 Protocols & Benefits Deliberate Heat Exposure

understand rest information tools follow. Next, like talk


use deliberate heat exposure, including sauna, tools well,
way understand heat heating changes biology. So, going learn
mechanism going learn tools. first like just
emphasize use deliberate heat exposure can powerful way
improve health longevity. wonderful study published
2018 includes lot data lot participants, lot different conditions,
instance, people sauna versus two three times week versus
four seven times week on, compares those. title study
Sauna Bathing Associated Reduced Cardiovascular Mortality Improves Risk
Prediction Men Women Prospective Cohort Study. one several papers
clearly demonstrate regular use sauna forms deliberate heat
exposure can reduce mortality cardiovascular events, also events, things
like stroke things basically can kill us. like much
related studies, yes, will provide link show notes,
involve lot participants. instance, particular paper, published
BMC Medicine, looked sample 1,688 participants mean age
63, range ages around 63, 51.4% women. rest
men. pretty nicely varied study terms populations looked
at. basically found often people sauna, better
health lower likelihood will die sort cardiovascular
event. mean sauna? need define parameters around
sauna, promise provide alternative ways access health
benefits observed related studies without need sauna,
'cause realize lot people don't access sauna. First off,
temperature ranges used pretty much studies going
talk about, unless say otherwise, 80 degrees Celsius, meaning 176
degrees Fahrenheit, 100 degrees Celsius, meaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
somewhere range. hot make sauna environment
get decide use tools? Well, will depend
tolerance heat, heat adapted are. Yes, people better sweating
others. time get better sweating. Meaning go
sauna frequently, become better sweater, not sweater wear,
verb sweater, get better sweating, dumping heat loss water.
going depend. recommend starting lower end temperature scale,


hot even lower temperature further. Now, long
people exposing hot environments? Anywhere five 20
minutes per session. soon learn, brief periods just five minutes
heat exposure can powerful stimulus heat exposure significantly great
enough you. 20 minutes can also beneficial, 80 100 degrees Celsius,
meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit general range
studies use. particular study, compared effects people
sauna week, two three times per week, four seven times per
week. saw really remarkable. observed people
went sauna two three times per week 27% less likely die
cardiovascular event people went sauna just week,
temperature levels duration talked earlier. can imagine,
duration, temperature levels related. people went hot
environments really uncomfortable them, maybe went five
minutes. Whereas, comfortable heat adapted given
environment tolerance heat just simply higher whatever reason, well
tended stay longer. can take sort average five 20 minute
range, today mainly going talk exposures 10 20 minutes
temperatures between, again, 80 degrees 100 degrees Celsius, 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 212 degrees Fahrenheit. data point fact going
sauna two three times per week really beneficial can lower mortality
cardiovascular events. fact, benefits even greater people
going sauna four seven times per week. people 50% less likely
die cardiovascular event compared people went sauna just
week. really impressive, frankly, encouraging studies. Certainly
caught eye encouraged start using deliberate heat exposure regular
basis. particularly nice study, related study that, again,
linked show notes, looked number potentially confounding
variables, things like whether not people smoked, things like whether not people
overweight, whether not tended exercise not exercise,
able separate variables. percentages described earlier, 27%
less likely die cardiovascular event went sauna two three
times week 50% less likely die cardiovascular event went
sauna four times per week, compared just week. effects really


seem consequence sauna exposure not effect
correlated sauna exposure, like going gym people working
seven times week also happen get sauna, quitting smoking right
time adopt sauna protocol, sorts things. now
additional analyses use sauna improving health, say
offsetting mortality, found not just reductions cardiovascular
events, called all-cause mortality. kind medical geek speak saying,
likely somebody die cardiovascular event, maybe also
event, health-related event, like cancer something
sort. every case, regular exposure sauna starting two three times
per week, way seven times per week, greatly improves, meaning statistically
significant improvements longevity sense people less likely die
cardiovascular events things kill us. many people
interested not just health, educating health-related tools

00:33:37 Tools & Conditions Deliberate Heat Exposure

general public, find really exciting. knowing know heat

deliberate heat exposure incredible effects. get
biological mechanisms heat can impressive health effects, want
just talk use sauna tool emphasize don't use
sauna order get benefits. simply matter making sure shell

nothing special one approaches protocols. just happens
sauna one convenient ways this. certainly studies
talked about, not just ones referenced before, studies
researched looking episode, makes sense use sauna,
hard, instance, create conditions five people go

Another set positive effects related hot environments hormone

problematic reasons. heat shock proteins, many
varieties, basically job traveling brain body making sure
cells contain proteins misfolding got heated much,
don't misfold, also, sort protective mechanism, making sure proteins
within cells brain body don't fold wrong ways. Again, describing
general terms, well established animal models humans,
sauna exposure sort described earlier activates heat shock proteins.
interesting studies carried animal models really nicely
mechanistically support role heat shock proteins benefits
deliberate heat exposure. studies done flies, meaning Drosophila,
fruit flies, 'cause great model organism, can delete genes add

carried humans, will talk those. One dramatic
examples always touted field deliberate heat exposure relates

remain sauna. Now, study published just last year
mainly focused deliberate cold exposure. detailed quite extensively
episode cold. beautiful work Susanna Søberg. study looked
deliberate cold exposure, also sauna exposure. study found 57, yes, 57
minutes per week sauna exposure conjunction 11 minutes per week total
deliberate cold exposure threshold getting improvements metabolism
increases brown fat, active fat tissue improves mitochondrial function
thermogenesis, meaning heating body. talk brown fat later.
mention this? Well, interested increasing
metabolism, seem beneficial 11 minutes per week cold
exposure, again, divided across two sessions. not 11 minutes
once, shorter sessions, get 57 minutes minimum per week sauna
exposure, again, temperature ranges talked here. again,
not 57 minutes sauna once. 57 minutes total per week
minimum threshold. might divide three sessions 20 minutes.
again, don't think 57 magic number. 60, 64. probably
55. Remember biological systems not counting things off minute
minute, second second, least not cases.
interested improving metabolism, check episode cold, just take
Søberg Protocol, call it, 11 minutes total per week uncomfortably cold,
safe, cold exposure. uncomfortably cold means really, really want get
shower ice bath whatever environment, can stay in, 11 minutes


total per week divided across couple sessions 57 minutes per week, so,
deliberate heat exposure, again, uncomfortably, uncomfortably hot, excuse me,
safe stay in, probably divided across three sessions. Okay,
talked use sauna decrease cortisol. talked use sauna

00:54:48 Deliberate Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

increase heat shock proteins. talked use sauna increase
FOXO3. Now like talk use sauna increase growth hormone. Growth
hormone hormone naturally secrete pituitary, also resides
near roof mouth. signal pituitary release growth hormone arrives
neurons exist hypothalamus. growth hormone releasing hormones,
believe not, called, stimulate release growth hormone
anterior pituitary gland general circulation, growth hormone impacts
metabolism growth cells tissues body. responsible tissue repair
well. growth spurt everyone experiences puberty
consequence growth hormone. describe study found
dramatic, really dramatic say, increases growth hormone, also want
emphasize increases growth hormone not sort
observed puberty infants becoming adolescents adolescents growing
teenagers. levels growth hormone associated massive
transformations, excuse me, body morphology, shape, far greater sorts
talking here. yet, us age, go adolescence
teenage years young adulthood, starting early 30s
so, amount growth hormone secrete greatly diminished. Normally
release growth hormone every night, go sleep, particular early
part night sleep comprised mostly slow-wave sleep. age,
less growth hormone released slow wave sleep. various things
can promote release growth hormone, will talk
things moment, things like low blood sugar, turns out, stimulus growth

shown stimulate growth hormone release. moments, talk
exercise fasting can combined heat can combined exercise
certain patterns food intake increase growth hormone. that,
want review data, one study particular, discovered certain
forms deliberate heat exposure using sauna can stimulate large increases
growth hormone output, people 30s, 40s, beyond
useful, may also useful people just trying stimulate release
growth hormone order to, instance, recover exercise stimulate fat
loss muscle growth repair particular injury. title paper "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Sauna Bathing." paper published 1986,
years ago, nonetheless serves basis lot studies
followed. let describe study. used 80 degree Celsius
environment, 176 degrees Fahrenheit, subjects sauna
30 minutes, four times per day. two hours total one day, 30 minutes
sauna, period cool rest, 30 minutes sauna again, cool rest, third,
fourth time. So, two hours total 80 degree Celsius environment.
lot, observed really quite significant. subjects
protocol, mention male female subjects study,
entire study lasted week. two hours sauna exposure day one,
day three, day seven week. measured lot different hormones,
cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroid hormone itself, luteinizing hormone,
follicle stimulating hormone, hormones essentially drive production
hormones. won't get deeply, like learn FSH,
follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, please see episode
optimizing testosterone estrogen hubermanlab.com. looked prolactin
looked growth hormone. just cut chase tell effects
growth hormone. subjects two hour day, 80 degree Celsius protocol
experienced 16-fold increases growth hormone. measured growth hormone
sauna sauna growth hormone levels went 16 fold,
obviously enormous, turns statistically significant, effect. Now, one
important caveat here. Remember earlier talked people sauna


week versus two three times week versus four seven times week,
often people sauna, less likely die cardiovascular events
things sort? Well, case, effects sauna exposure growth
hormone actually went often people deliberate heat
exposure. mentioned, two hour day divided 30 minute
sessions protocol day one, day three, day seven week. found
day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared
sauna, effect basically cut two thirds. now instead getting 16-fold
increase, like three four-fold increase, still huge increase,
not great increase observed day one. day seven, tended
two, maybe threefold increase, not great one observed day
one. mean? happen? Well, reason happens
heat, just like cold, shock stressor system. context cold,
get cold ice bath, instance, five-degree ice bath, even 20
seconds, known increase norepinephrine 200%. can double amount
norepinephrine suddenly release brain body, actually can
positive effects. talk little bit,
every day, become cold adapted. circuit compares shelling core
body adjust ways either predict cold stimulus,
likely create thermogenetic mechanisms preparation cold exposure.
why, instance, people use deliberate cold exposure try increase
lipolysis, burning fat, oftentimes will get results while,
lot, lot, stop getting effects. talk lot avoiding cold adaptation,
goal, episode cold, similar mechanisms play here.
imagine subjects got sauna day one, whatever
pathways went measurement temperature shell changes temperature
core led big increases growth hormone, basically way just
describing result already told before. fact result diminished
time either means circuit not efficient communicating shift
temperature shift temperature less impact downstream
effectors not engaged extent wasn't much shock.
think latter explanation far likely. much akin weight
training cardiovascular exercise, run hill fast, instance,


lungs burning heaving breathing hard, first day,
painful thing. every day every day, provided allow
recover, pretty soon running hill not breathing
hard. isn't much burning muscles, et cetera, et cetera. body
adapts. So, one key things understand use deliberate heat
exposure going use order try trigger massive increases
growth hormone, going need careful not than,
say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean
discouraging using deliberate heat exposure access growth hormone increases,
specific goal main goal, think reasonable say
don't want deliberate heat exposure, least not sort described here,
week, maybe even every 10 days, want
time events life, maybe hard workouts, trying push
fat loss barrier simply order access growth hormone peak levels,
maybe three times per month four times per month. start deliberate heat
exposure often, still get increases growth hormone, not going
nearly large increases growth hormone

01:04:32 Parameters Heat & Cold Exposure

going experience shock system deliberate heat exposure
every while. important way frame actually context cold.
might say, wait, episode heat heating, not cold,
really can't conversation heat heating without talking cold.
Because, mentioned earlier, cool outside body, shell,
actually heating body. fact, circuits control heating body
control cooling body, instance, activation things like shiver fat loss
response cold shiver, also controlled preoptic area
hypothalamus. can take step back start think take
design optimal protocol deliberate heat exposure looking cold,
mean. beautiful studies showing people get
cold body water, four degrees Celsius 20 seconds. mentioned earlier, will


cause 200 300% increase norepinephrine. Norepinephrine also called
noradrenaline. norepinephrine so-called catacholamines like dopamine
increased dramatically brief cold water exposure. increases
norepinephrine dopamine known long-lasting effects generally lead
improvements mood, focus, alertness. pretty significant. However,
aren't significant enough increase metabolism high degree. Whereas,
studies shown people go outside 16 degree Celsius weather
proper amount, fairly minimum amount clothing, can experience even
greater increases norepinephrine. time required order experience
increases six hours at, instance, 16 degrees Celsius. six
hours day cold, can turn air conditioning
environment make very, cold, fine. basically describing
can sort bookend parameters can use. can use brief
exposure cold heat order stimulate heat shock proteins, growth hormone, et
cetera, can use longer exposure less intense versions heat cold.
really find going work can safely.
confused start, please use parameters described earlier. First
all, check doctor. always, make sure somebody can
deliberate cold heat exposure safely, 80 100 degrees Celsius, meaning
176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit, keep repeating over,
'cause know somebody's going ask, even though repeat over,
fine, delighted keep saying it, respond someone asks again. Well,
parameters going kind bookend terms intensity
heat stimulus. long? Well, heard earlier, five 20 minutes. not start
five ramp 10 15? feeling really bold
really want crank growth hormone, well, 30 minute four
times one day stimulus every while. really figure
using heat exposure for. one reasons people say,
better get wet sauna dry sauna? optimal temperature? better
take hot shower hot bath hot tub? completely honest, depends
going able regularly, whether not want regularly,
specific goals are. purpose episode really arm
underlying mechanisms arm general parameters going
allow access results seeking. worth, personally


use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to
Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli Healthy Men. "Is Difference?"
don't want go details study, pretty extensive
complicated, basically people sauna gave

found sauna waiting period time
later day sauna again, didn't see increase growth hormone

sauna again. people exercise sauna, found
exercise stimulate growth hormone, following sauna not allow
get twice much growth hormone. general, anytime release growth

later day. partially explains earlier study, people
growth hormone promoting protocol day one, day three didn't see
quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week
going beneficial number reasons described earlier. don't
want obsess much exact conditions need order get
greatest effect sauna treatment. just additional tweaks
related food intake low level hypoglycemia exercise, wanted
leverage, could. decreases body temperature tend aid transition

sense want put

01:16:20 Tool: Hydration & Sauna

sauna exposure deliberate heat exposure second half day,
maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes
water not. going depend much sweat, meaning heat

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.

lot observed positive effects biology relate metabolism,
cardiovascular function, also mental health. along lines,
wonderful study, again, published 2018. don't know why. guess 2018 big
year deliberate heat exposure studies. title study "Sauna Bathing "and
Risk Psychotic Disorders." prospective cohort study. Again,
provide link study. really interesting study explored relationship

schizophrenia forms psychoses, use sauna. essentially


study looked large number subjects, 2,000 subjects,
no history psychotic disorders. classified three groups based
frequency sauna use, either week, two three times per week,
four seven times per week. call mind earlier study all-risk

psychosis specifically, meaning likely people develop psychotic
symptoms full blown psychotic illness, according frequency sauna session.
So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association

going prevent people becoming schizophrenic, necessarily,
psychotic episode, necessarily. course, frequent sauna use will related
health-promoting activities. study, previous study, went
great lengths order try limit so-called confounding variables. Now,
course, just one study, again, correlative, not causal, based

specifically, talk biology heat heating health benefits
tools related heat heating. first question answer
heat up? answer question heat two ways. heat
outside, meaning things come contact with, clothing put
body, whether not heat room, whether not cold outside
cold room, heat inside. body capacity generate
heat cool down, meaning turn off heating process, can
ways match external environment. simplest way think
actually two body temperatures. People will say, "Oh, body


temperature? "98.6." actually not true. Body temperature varies
individuals. varies across time day within individuals. every point across
entire lifespan, two distinct temperatures. One temperature skin,
scientists call shell, temperature core, viscera, meaning
organs, nervous system, spinal cord. can imagine,
temperature core always higher temperature surface.
important thing know temperature shell temperature
core. Now don't need know exactly temperatures
cases, vitally important understand two temperatures
brain constantly sending signals body whether not
heat cool down, depending temperature shell, makes
total sense. lot like thermostat room, essentially paying attention
cold hot is, sending signals heating cooling system
either heat environment cool environment, depending
temperature environment. brain neurons send signals cells
body deploy release chemicals brain body heat
cold cool hot. So, can
understand two body temperatures, one shell, surface,
one core, inside, body brain always trying balance
two temperatures appropriate way, well halfway understanding
biology thermal regulation heating, lot along
understanding specific tools can used improve metabolism improve
cognition, instance. fact, later will learn one way can heat
cooling surface body. right. throw cold towel, ice
cold towel, onto torso right now ask you, "Well, feel?" say,
"Oh, cold, chilly." However, brain acting like bit
thermostat surface, shell body felt cool, make sense
thermostat activate biological mechanisms heat core. Similarly,
put hot environment, say, "Oh, wow, really, really
warm here," brain body go lot effort activate
mechanisms cool down. anytime talking heat, meaning deliberate
heat exposure, things like sauna, important understand, not just stimulus,
hot something is, long sauna, et cetera, effect
shell core. can understand can design protocols

cooling, matter, goes back well hundred years. fact, kind amusing
nowadays kind renewed interest use heat cold
science heat cold, first topic studied


undergraduate. fact, graduate thesis thermal regulation.
time, thermal regulation wasn't really considered one hot topics neuroscience.
People focused things like memory consciousness. course
topics still vital interest many people many laboratories, thermal
regulation considered thing physiologists. Nowadays, not just
social media, not just landscape biohackers athletes, landscape
mental health, frankly, general ethos around health optimization, people
really interested heat cold. reason interested heat cold
lot science done animal models mice humans
translates immediately protocols anyone can use. Now, brief warning now
another brief warning later, anytime talking heating body,
need cautious, unlike cooling down, fairly broad
range cold temperatures can go damaging tissue, well,
don't get heat brain body much start getting realm
neuron damage, neuron's central nervous system, brain spinal

00:26:30 Protocols & Benefits Deliberate Heat Exposure

understand rest information tools follow. Next, like talk


use deliberate heat exposure, including sauna, tools well,
way understand heat heating changes biology. So, going learn
mechanism going learn tools. first like just
emphasize use deliberate heat exposure can powerful way
improve health longevity. wonderful study published
2018 includes lot data lot participants, lot different conditions,
instance, people sauna versus two three times week versus
four seven times week on, compares those. title study
Sauna Bathing Associated Reduced Cardiovascular Mortality Improves Risk
Prediction Men Women Prospective Cohort Study. one several papers
clearly demonstrate regular use sauna forms deliberate heat
exposure can reduce mortality cardiovascular events, also events, things
like stroke things basically can kill us. like much
related studies, yes, will provide link show notes,
involve lot participants. instance, particular paper, published
BMC Medicine, looked sample 1,688 participants mean age
63, range ages around 63, 51.4% women. rest
men. pretty nicely varied study terms populations looked
at. basically found often people sauna, better
health lower likelihood will die sort cardiovascular
event. mean sauna? need define parameters around
sauna, promise provide alternative ways access health
benefits observed related studies without need sauna,
'cause realize lot people don't access sauna. First off,
temperature ranges used pretty much studies going
talk about, unless say otherwise, 80 degrees Celsius, meaning 176
degrees Fahrenheit, 100 degrees Celsius, meaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
somewhere range. hot make sauna environment
get decide use tools? Well, will depend
tolerance heat, heat adapted are. Yes, people better sweating
others. time get better sweating. Meaning go
sauna frequently, become better sweater, not sweater wear,
verb sweater, get better sweating, dumping heat loss water.
going depend. recommend starting lower end temperature scale,


hot even lower temperature further. Now, long
people exposing hot environments? Anywhere five 20
minutes per session. soon learn, brief periods just five minutes
heat exposure can powerful stimulus heat exposure significantly great
enough you. 20 minutes can also beneficial, 80 100 degrees Celsius,
meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit general range
studies use. particular study, compared effects people
sauna week, two three times per week, four seven times per
week. saw really remarkable. observed people
went sauna two three times per week 27% less likely die
cardiovascular event people went sauna just week,
temperature levels duration talked earlier. can imagine,
duration, temperature levels related. people went hot
environments really uncomfortable them, maybe went five
minutes. Whereas, comfortable heat adapted given
environment tolerance heat just simply higher whatever reason, well
tended stay longer. can take sort average five 20 minute
range, today mainly going talk exposures 10 20 minutes
temperatures between, again, 80 degrees 100 degrees Celsius, 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 212 degrees Fahrenheit. data point fact going
sauna two three times per week really beneficial can lower mortality
cardiovascular events. fact, benefits even greater people
going sauna four seven times per week. people 50% less likely
die cardiovascular event compared people went sauna just
week. really impressive, frankly, encouraging studies. Certainly
caught eye encouraged start using deliberate heat exposure regular
basis. particularly nice study, related study that, again,
linked show notes, looked number potentially confounding
variables, things like whether not people smoked, things like whether not people
overweight, whether not tended exercise not exercise,
able separate variables. percentages described earlier, 27%
less likely die cardiovascular event went sauna two three
times week 50% less likely die cardiovascular event went
sauna four times per week, compared just week. effects really


seem consequence sauna exposure not effect
correlated sauna exposure, like going gym people working
seven times week also happen get sauna, quitting smoking right
time adopt sauna protocol, sorts things. now
additional analyses use sauna improving health, say
offsetting mortality, found not just reductions cardiovascular
events, called all-cause mortality. kind medical geek speak saying,
likely somebody die cardiovascular event, maybe also
event, health-related event, like cancer something
sort. every case, regular exposure sauna starting two three times
per week, way seven times per week, greatly improves, meaning statistically
significant improvements longevity sense people less likely die
cardiovascular events things kill us. many people
interested not just health, educating health-related tools

00:33:37 Tools & Conditions Deliberate Heat Exposure

general public, find really exciting. knowing know heat

deliberate heat exposure incredible effects. get
biological mechanisms heat can impressive health effects, want
just talk use sauna tool emphasize don't use
sauna order get benefits. simply matter making sure shell
core heat properly bit, not much, not little, heat

nothing special one approaches protocols. just happens
sauna one convenient ways this. certainly studies
talked about, not just ones referenced before, studies
researched looking episode, makes sense use sauna,
hard, instance, create conditions five people go

Another set positive effects related hot environments hormone

problematic reasons. heat shock proteins, many
varieties, basically job traveling brain body making sure
cells contain proteins misfolding got heated much,
don't misfold, also, sort protective mechanism, making sure proteins
within cells brain body don't fold wrong ways. Again, describing
general terms, well established animal models humans,
sauna exposure sort described earlier activates heat shock proteins.
interesting studies carried animal models really nicely
mechanistically support role heat shock proteins benefits
deliberate heat exposure. studies done flies, meaning Drosophila,
fruit flies, 'cause great model organism, can delete genes add

carried humans, will talk those. One dramatic
examples always touted field deliberate heat exposure relates

00:52:30 Deliberate Cold & Heat Exposure & Metabolism

five 20 minutes per session sauna rough guide long
remain sauna. Now, study published just last year
mainly focused deliberate cold exposure. detailed quite extensively
episode cold. beautiful work Susanna Søberg. study looked
deliberate cold exposure, also sauna exposure. study found 57, yes, 57
minutes per week sauna exposure conjunction 11 minutes per week total
deliberate cold exposure threshold getting improvements metabolism
increases brown fat, active fat tissue improves mitochondrial function
thermogenesis, meaning heating body. talk brown fat later.
mention this? Well, interested increasing
metabolism, seem beneficial 11 minutes per week cold
exposure, again, divided across two sessions. not 11 minutes
once, shorter sessions, get 57 minutes minimum per week sauna
exposure, again, temperature ranges talked here. again,
not 57 minutes sauna once. 57 minutes total per week
minimum threshold. might divide three sessions 20 minutes.
again, don't think 57 magic number. 60, 64. probably
55. Remember biological systems not counting things off minute
minute, second second, least not cases.
interested improving metabolism, check episode cold, just take
Søberg Protocol, call it, 11 minutes total per week uncomfortably cold,
safe, cold exposure. uncomfortably cold means really, really want get
shower ice bath whatever environment, can stay in, 11 minutes


total per week divided across couple sessions 57 minutes per week, so,
deliberate heat exposure, again, uncomfortably, uncomfortably hot, excuse me,
safe stay in, probably divided across three sessions. Okay,
talked use sauna decrease cortisol. talked use sauna

00:54:48 Deliberate Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

increase heat shock proteins. talked use sauna increase
FOXO3. Now like talk use sauna increase growth hormone. Growth
hormone hormone naturally secrete pituitary, also resides
near roof mouth. signal pituitary release growth hormone arrives
neurons exist hypothalamus. growth hormone releasing hormones,
believe not, called, stimulate release growth hormone
anterior pituitary gland general circulation, growth hormone impacts
metabolism growth cells tissues body. responsible tissue repair
well. growth spurt everyone experiences puberty
consequence growth hormone. describe study found

emphasize increases growth hormone not sort
observed puberty infants becoming adolescents adolescents growing
teenagers. levels growth hormone associated massive

talking here. yet, us age, go adolescence
teenage years young adulthood, starting early 30s
so, amount growth hormone secrete greatly diminished. Normally
release growth hormone every night, go sleep, particular early
part night sleep comprised mostly slow-wave sleep. age,
less growth hormone released slow wave sleep. various things
can promote release growth hormone, will talk

certain patterns food intake increase growth hormone. that,
want review data, one study particular, discovered certain
forms deliberate heat exposure using sauna can stimulate large increases
growth hormone output, people 30s, 40s, beyond
useful, may also useful people just trying stimulate release
growth hormone order to, instance, recover exercise stimulate fat
loss muscle growth repair particular injury. title paper "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Sauna Bathing." paper published 1986,
years ago, nonetheless serves basis lot studies
followed. let describe study. used 80 degree Celsius
environment, 176 degrees Fahrenheit, subjects sauna
30 minutes, four times per day. two hours total one day, 30 minutes
sauna, period cool rest, 30 minutes sauna again, cool rest, third,
fourth time. So, two hours total 80 degree Celsius environment.
lot, observed really quite significant. subjects
protocol, mention male female subjects study,
entire study lasted week. two hours sauna exposure day one,
day three, day seven week. measured lot different hormones,
cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroid hormone itself, luteinizing hormone,
follicle stimulating hormone, hormones essentially drive production
hormones. won't get deeply, like learn FSH,
follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, please see episode
optimizing testosterone estrogen hubermanlab.com. looked prolactin
looked growth hormone. just cut chase tell effects
growth hormone. subjects two hour day, 80 degree Celsius protocol
experienced 16-fold increases growth hormone. measured growth hormone
sauna sauna growth hormone levels went 16 fold,
obviously enormous, turns statistically significant, effect. Now, one
important caveat here. Remember earlier talked people sauna


week versus two three times week versus four seven times week,
often people sauna, less likely die cardiovascular events
things sort? Well, case, effects sauna exposure growth
hormone actually went often people deliberate heat
exposure. mentioned, two hour day divided 30 minute
sessions protocol day one, day three, day seven week. found
day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared
sauna, effect basically cut two thirds. now instead getting 16-fold
increase, like three four-fold increase, still huge increase,
not great increase observed day one. day seven, tended
two, maybe threefold increase, not great one observed day
one. mean? happen? Well, reason happens
heat, just like cold, shock stressor system. context cold,
get cold ice bath, instance, five-degree ice bath, even 20
seconds, known increase norepinephrine 200%. can double amount
norepinephrine suddenly release brain body, actually can
positive effects. talk little bit,
every day, become cold adapted. circuit compares shelling core
body adjust ways either predict cold stimulus,
likely create thermogenetic mechanisms preparation cold exposure.
why, instance, people use deliberate cold exposure try increase
lipolysis, burning fat, oftentimes will get results while,
lot, lot, stop getting effects. talk lot avoiding cold adaptation,
goal, episode cold, similar mechanisms play here.
imagine subjects got sauna day one, whatever
pathways went measurement temperature shell changes temperature
core led big increases growth hormone, basically way just
describing result already told before. fact result diminished
time either means circuit not efficient communicating shift

effectors not engaged extent wasn't much shock.
think latter explanation far likely. much akin weight

lungs burning heaving breathing hard, first day,
painful thing. every day every day, provided allow
recover, pretty soon running hill not breathing
hard. isn't much burning muscles, et cetera, et cetera. body
adapts. So, one key things understand use deliberate heat
exposure going use order try trigger massive increases
growth hormone, going need careful not than,
say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean
discouraging using deliberate heat exposure access growth hormone increases,
specific goal main goal, think reasonable say
don't want deliberate heat exposure, least not sort described here,
week, maybe even every 10 days, want
time events life, maybe hard workouts, trying push
fat loss barrier simply order access growth hormone peak levels,
maybe three times per month four times per month. start deliberate heat
exposure often, still get increases growth hormone, not going
nearly large increases growth hormone

01:04:32 Parameters Heat & Cold Exposure

going experience shock system deliberate heat exposure
every while. important way frame actually context cold.
might say, wait, episode heat heating, not cold,
really can't conversation heat heating without talking cold.
Because, mentioned earlier, cool outside body, shell,
actually heating body. fact, circuits control heating body
control cooling body, instance, activation things like shiver fat loss

design optimal protocol deliberate heat exposure looking cold,
mean. beautiful studies showing people get
cold body water, four degrees Celsius 20 seconds. mentioned earlier, will


cause 200 300% increase norepinephrine. Norepinephrine also called
noradrenaline. norepinephrine so-called catacholamines like dopamine
increased dramatically brief cold water exposure. increases
norepinephrine dopamine known long-lasting effects generally lead
improvements mood, focus, alertness. pretty significant. However,
aren't significant enough increase metabolism high degree. Whereas,
studies shown people go outside 16 degree Celsius weather
proper amount, fairly minimum amount clothing, can experience even
greater increases norepinephrine. time required order experience

cetera, can use longer exposure less intense versions heat cold.
really find going work can safely.
confused start, please use parameters described earlier. First
all, check doctor. always, make sure somebody can

really want crank growth hormone, well, 30 minute four
times one day stimulus every while. really figure
using heat exposure for. one reasons people say,
better get wet sauna dry sauna? optimal temperature? better
take hot shower hot bath hot tub? completely honest, depends
going able regularly, whether not want regularly,
specific goals are. purpose episode really arm
underlying mechanisms arm general parameters going
allow access results seeking. worth, personally


use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to

quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.

So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association

temperature? "98.6." actually not true. Body temperature varies
individuals. varies across time day within individuals. every point across
entire lifespan, two distinct temperatures. One temperature skin,
scientists call shell, temperature core, viscera, meaning
organs, nervous system, spinal cord. can imagine,
temperature core always higher temperature surface.
important thing know temperature shell temperature
core. Now don't need know exactly temperatures
cases, vitally important understand two temperatures
brain constantly sending signals body whether not
heat cool down, depending temperature shell, makes
total sense. lot like thermostat room, essentially paying attention
cold hot is, sending signals heating cooling system
either heat environment cool environment, depending
temperature environment. brain neurons send signals cells

00:26:30 Protocols & Benefits Deliberate Heat Exposure

understand rest information tools follow. Next, like talk


use deliberate heat exposure, including sauna, tools well,
way understand heat heating changes biology. So, going learn
mechanism going learn tools. first like just
emphasize use deliberate heat exposure can powerful way
improve health longevity. wonderful study published
2018 includes lot data lot participants, lot different conditions,
instance, people sauna versus two three times week versus
four seven times week on, compares those. title study
Sauna Bathing Associated Reduced Cardiovascular Mortality Improves Risk
Prediction Men Women Prospective Cohort Study. one several papers
clearly demonstrate regular use sauna forms deliberate heat
exposure can reduce mortality cardiovascular events, also events, things
like stroke things basically can kill us. like much
related studies, yes, will provide link show notes,
involve lot participants. instance, particular paper, published
BMC Medicine, looked sample 1,688 participants mean age
63, range ages around 63, 51.4% women. rest
men. pretty nicely varied study terms populations looked
at. basically found often people sauna, better
health lower likelihood will die sort cardiovascular
event. mean sauna? need define parameters around
sauna, promise provide alternative ways access health
benefits observed related studies without need sauna,
'cause realize lot people don't access sauna. First off,
temperature ranges used pretty much studies going
talk about, unless say otherwise, 80 degrees Celsius, meaning 176
degrees Fahrenheit, 100 degrees Celsius, meaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
somewhere range. hot make sauna environment
get decide use tools? Well, will depend
tolerance heat, heat adapted are. Yes, people better sweating
others. time get better sweating. Meaning go
sauna frequently, become better sweater, not sweater wear,
verb sweater, get better sweating, dumping heat loss water.
going depend. recommend starting lower end temperature scale,


hot even lower temperature further. Now, long
people exposing hot environments? Anywhere five 20
minutes per session. soon learn, brief periods just five minutes
heat exposure can powerful stimulus heat exposure significantly great
enough you. 20 minutes can also beneficial, 80 100 degrees Celsius,
meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit general range
studies use. particular study, compared effects people
sauna week, two three times per week, four seven times per
week. saw really remarkable. observed people
went sauna two three times per week 27% less likely die
cardiovascular event people went sauna just week,
temperature levels duration talked earlier. can imagine,
duration, temperature levels related. people went hot
environments really uncomfortable them, maybe went five
minutes. Whereas, comfortable heat adapted given
environment tolerance heat just simply higher whatever reason, well
tended stay longer. can take sort average five 20 minute
range, today mainly going talk exposures 10 20 minutes
temperatures between, again, 80 degrees 100 degrees Celsius, 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 212 degrees Fahrenheit. data point fact going
sauna two three times per week really beneficial can lower mortality
cardiovascular events. fact, benefits even greater people
going sauna four seven times per week. people 50% less likely
die cardiovascular event compared people went sauna just
week. really impressive, frankly, encouraging studies. Certainly
caught eye encouraged start using deliberate heat exposure regular
basis. particularly nice study, related study that, again,
linked show notes, looked number potentially confounding
variables, things like whether not people smoked, things like whether not people
overweight, whether not tended exercise not exercise,
able separate variables. percentages described earlier, 27%
less likely die cardiovascular event went sauna two three
times week 50% less likely die cardiovascular event went
sauna four times per week, compared just week. effects really


seem consequence sauna exposure not effect
correlated sauna exposure, like going gym people working
seven times week also happen get sauna, quitting smoking right
time adopt sauna protocol, sorts things. now
additional analyses use sauna improving health, say
offsetting mortality, found not just reductions cardiovascular
events, called all-cause mortality. kind medical geek speak saying,
likely somebody die cardiovascular event, maybe also
event, health-related event, like cancer something
sort. every case, regular exposure sauna starting two three times
per week, way seven times per week, greatly improves, meaning statistically
significant improvements longevity sense people less likely die
cardiovascular events things kill us. many people
interested not just health, educating health-related tools

00:33:37 Tools & Conditions Deliberate Heat Exposure

general public, find really exciting. knowing know heat
impacts biology, probably shouldn't surprise us sauna type exposure
deliberate heat exposure incredible effects. get
biological mechanisms heat can impressive health effects, want
just talk use sauna tool emphasize don't use
sauna order get benefits. simply matter making sure shell
core heat properly bit, not much, not little, heat
up. no, not need carry thermometer around place thermometer
core. laboratory studies humans, really want know someone's
core temperature, basically try put thermal probe close core
can. typically done rectally mouth thermometer even nose.
don't need that. isn't laboratory study. ways create hot
environment heat shell core safely without
measure core temperature along. want that, guess, not
going provide protocol. question is, heating
environment? realize dry saunas, steam saunas,
infrared saunas, hot tubs, simply rooms crank


heat. also ways can increase shell core
temperature moving around lot wearing lot clothing.
nothing special one approaches protocols. just happens
sauna one convenient ways this. certainly studies
talked about, not just ones referenced before, studies
researched looking episode, makes sense use sauna,
hard, instance, create conditions five people go
jogging, wearing heavy sweaters hats, wool hats middle summer,
hard set conditions way controlled everybody. Whereas,
pretty straightforward sauna one several people just get
one uniformly hot environment. much easier study run. just
clear, temperature range important. want get 80 100 degrees

wish drop water weight will wear, go jogging that. will increase
shell core body temperature. Especially hot day,
course careful, hydrate don't overheat. Don't become excessively hyperthermic,
'cause can get heat stroke can potentially die. going use
sauna, often get question hot sauna be? Well now know.

what? Doesn't matter. Use prefer. Many people ask me, "Well,
infrared sauna?" entire episode use light low level light
therapy, including infrared light. certain benefits skin organs

infrared saunas don't get hot enough. don't get
80 100 degrees Celsius range. do, don't. end
situation got red light, low level light therapy stimulus, got
sauna not quite hot enough. lot ideas claims


work together order get improved benefits. personally stance,
based literature read, want get ranges 80 100

00:38:47 Deliberate Heat Exposure, Cortisol & Cardiovascular Health

soon learn, talk cold, actually talking

Another set positive effects related hot environments hormone

effects going hot environment period time activation so-
called heat shock proteins, HSPs. Heat shock proteins protective mechanism
brain body rescue proteins otherwise misfold. mean
this? Well, familiar fact protein kitchen, like

least short term, activating heat shock proteins good thing. don't want
heat shock proteins activated long periods time, gets
problematic reasons. heat shock proteins, many
varieties, basically job traveling brain body making sure
cells contain proteins misfolding got heated much,
don't misfold, also, sort protective mechanism, making sure proteins
within cells brain body don't fold wrong ways. Again, describing
general terms, well established animal models humans,
sauna exposure sort described earlier activates heat shock proteins.
interesting studies carried animal models really nicely
mechanistically support role heat shock proteins benefits
deliberate heat exposure. studies done flies, meaning Drosophila,
fruit flies, 'cause great model organism, can delete genes add

carried humans, will talk those. One dramatic
examples always touted field deliberate heat exposure relates
longevity expose flies, fruit flies 70 minutes heat

years ago, nonetheless serves basis lot studies
followed. let describe study. used 80 degree Celsius

30 minutes, four times per day. two hours total one day, 30 minutes
sauna, period cool rest, 30 minutes sauna again, cool rest, third,
fourth time. So, two hours total 80 degree Celsius environment.
lot, observed really quite significant. subjects
protocol, mention male female subjects study,
entire study lasted week. two hours sauna exposure day one,
day three, day seven week. measured lot different hormones,
cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroid hormone itself, luteinizing hormone,
follicle stimulating hormone, hormones essentially drive production

looked growth hormone. just cut chase tell effects
growth hormone. subjects two hour day, 80 degree Celsius protocol
experienced 16-fold increases growth hormone. measured growth hormone
sauna sauna growth hormone levels went 16 fold,
obviously enormous, turns statistically significant, effect. Now, one
important caveat here. Remember earlier talked people sauna


week versus two three times week versus four seven times week,
often people sauna, less likely die cardiovascular events
things sort? Well, case, effects sauna exposure growth
hormone actually went often people deliberate heat
exposure. mentioned, two hour day divided 30 minute
sessions protocol day one, day three, day seven week. found
day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared
sauna, effect basically cut two thirds. now instead getting 16-fold
increase, like three four-fold increase, still huge increase,
not great increase observed day one. day seven, tended
two, maybe threefold increase, not great one observed day
one. mean? happen? Well, reason happens
heat, just like cold, shock stressor system. context cold,
get cold ice bath, instance, five-degree ice bath, even 20

why, instance, people use deliberate cold exposure try increase

growth hormone, going need careful not than,
say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean
discouraging using deliberate heat exposure access growth hormone increases,
specific goal main goal, think reasonable say
don't want deliberate heat exposure, least not sort described here,

sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal

reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine

triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot

heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.

00:26:30 Protocols & Benefits Deliberate Heat Exposure

understand rest information tools follow. Next, like talk


use deliberate heat exposure, including sauna, tools well,
way understand heat heating changes biology. So, going learn
mechanism going learn tools. first like just
emphasize use deliberate heat exposure can powerful way
improve health longevity. wonderful study published
2018 includes lot data lot participants, lot different conditions,
instance, people sauna versus two three times week versus
four seven times week on, compares those. title study
Sauna Bathing Associated Reduced Cardiovascular Mortality Improves Risk
Prediction Men Women Prospective Cohort Study. one several papers
clearly demonstrate regular use sauna forms deliberate heat
exposure can reduce mortality cardiovascular events, also events, things
like stroke things basically can kill us. like much
related studies, yes, will provide link show notes,
involve lot participants. instance, particular paper, published
BMC Medicine, looked sample 1,688 participants mean age
63, range ages around 63, 51.4% women. rest
men. pretty nicely varied study terms populations looked
at. basically found often people sauna, better
health lower likelihood will die sort cardiovascular
event. mean sauna? need define parameters around
sauna, promise provide alternative ways access health
benefits observed related studies without need sauna,
'cause realize lot people don't access sauna. First off,
temperature ranges used pretty much studies going
talk about, unless say otherwise, 80 degrees Celsius, meaning 176
degrees Fahrenheit, 100 degrees Celsius, meaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
somewhere range. hot make sauna environment
get decide use tools? Well, will depend
tolerance heat, heat adapted are. Yes, people better sweating
others. time get better sweating. Meaning go
sauna frequently, become better sweater, not sweater wear,
verb sweater, get better sweating, dumping heat loss water.
going depend. recommend starting lower end temperature scale,


hot even lower temperature further. Now, long
people exposing hot environments? Anywhere five 20
minutes per session. soon learn, brief periods just five minutes
heat exposure can powerful stimulus heat exposure significantly great
enough you. 20 minutes can also beneficial, 80 100 degrees Celsius,
meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit general range
studies use. particular study, compared effects people
sauna week, two three times per week, four seven times per
week. saw really remarkable. observed people
went sauna two three times per week 27% less likely die
cardiovascular event people went sauna just week,
temperature levels duration talked earlier. can imagine,
duration, temperature levels related. people went hot
environments really uncomfortable them, maybe went five
minutes. Whereas, comfortable heat adapted given
environment tolerance heat just simply higher whatever reason, well
tended stay longer. can take sort average five 20 minute
range, today mainly going talk exposures 10 20 minutes
temperatures between, again, 80 degrees 100 degrees Celsius, 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 212 degrees Fahrenheit. data point fact going
sauna two three times per week really beneficial can lower mortality
cardiovascular events. fact, benefits even greater people
going sauna four seven times per week. people 50% less likely
die cardiovascular event compared people went sauna just
week. really impressive, frankly, encouraging studies. Certainly
caught eye encouraged start using deliberate heat exposure regular
basis. particularly nice study, related study that, again,
linked show notes, looked number potentially confounding
variables, things like whether not people smoked, things like whether not people
overweight, whether not tended exercise not exercise,
able separate variables. percentages described earlier, 27%
less likely die cardiovascular event went sauna two three
times week 50% less likely die cardiovascular event went
sauna four times per week, compared just week. effects really


seem consequence sauna exposure not effect
correlated sauna exposure, like going gym people working
seven times week also happen get sauna, quitting smoking right
time adopt sauna protocol, sorts things. now
additional analyses use sauna improving health, say
offsetting mortality, found not just reductions cardiovascular
events, called all-cause mortality. kind medical geek speak saying,
likely somebody die cardiovascular event, maybe also
event, health-related event, like cancer something
sort. every case, regular exposure sauna starting two three times
per week, way seven times per week, greatly improves, meaning statistically
significant improvements longevity sense people less likely die
cardiovascular events things kill us. many people
interested not just health, educating health-related tools

00:33:37 Tools & Conditions Deliberate Heat Exposure

general public, find really exciting. knowing know heat
impacts biology, probably shouldn't surprise us sauna type exposure
deliberate heat exposure incredible effects. get
biological mechanisms heat can impressive health effects, want
just talk use sauna tool emphasize don't use
sauna order get benefits. simply matter making sure shell
core heat properly bit, not much, not little, heat
up. no, not need carry thermometer around place thermometer
core. laboratory studies humans, really want know someone's
core temperature, basically try put thermal probe close core
can. typically done rectally mouth thermometer even nose.
don't need that. isn't laboratory study. ways create hot
environment heat shell core safely without
measure core temperature along. want that, guess, not
going provide protocol. question is, heating
environment? realize dry saunas, steam saunas,
infrared saunas, hot tubs, simply rooms crank


heat. also ways can increase shell core
temperature moving around lot wearing lot clothing.
nothing special one approaches protocols. just happens
sauna one convenient ways this. certainly studies
talked about, not just ones referenced before, studies
researched looking episode, makes sense use sauna,
hard, instance, create conditions five people go
jogging, wearing heavy sweaters hats, wool hats middle summer,
hard set conditions way controlled everybody. Whereas,
pretty straightforward sauna one several people just get
one uniformly hot environment. much easier study run. just
clear, temperature range important. want get 80 100 degrees

wish drop water weight will wear, go jogging that. will increase
shell core body temperature. Especially hot day,
course careful, hydrate don't overheat. Don't become excessively hyperthermic,
'cause can get heat stroke can potentially die. going use

what? Doesn't matter. Use prefer. Many people ask me, "Well,
infrared sauna?" entire episode use light low level light
therapy, including infrared light. certain benefits skin organs

infrared saunas don't get hot enough. don't get
80 100 degrees Celsius range. do, don't. end
situation got red light, low level light therapy stimulus, got
sauna not quite hot enough. lot ideas claims


work together order get improved benefits. personally stance,
based literature read, want get ranges 80 100
degrees Celsius start considering whether not also going include
red light therapies, et cetera. nothing special red light sauna. really
temperature sauna happen get into. tool? sauna?

getting cardiovascular workout hot environment, even just sitting down.
Another set positive effects related hot environments hormone
effects, shifts output hormones, adrenals possibly
testes ovaries even within brain. One striking examples
comes study published 2021. title study "Endocrine

effects going hot environment period time activation so-
called heat shock proteins, HSPs. Heat shock proteins protective mechanism
brain body rescue proteins otherwise misfold. mean
this? Well, familiar fact protein kitchen, like

least short term, activating heat shock proteins good thing. don't want
heat shock proteins activated long periods time, gets
problematic reasons. heat shock proteins, many
varieties, basically job traveling brain body making sure
cells contain proteins misfolding got heated much,
don't misfold, also, sort protective mechanism, making sure proteins
within cells brain body don't fold wrong ways. Again, describing
general terms, well established animal models humans,
sauna exposure sort described earlier activates heat shock proteins.
interesting studies carried animal models really nicely
mechanistically support role heat shock proteins benefits
deliberate heat exposure. studies done flies, meaning Drosophila,
fruit flies, 'cause great model organism, can delete genes add

carried humans, will talk those. One dramatic
examples always touted field deliberate heat exposure relates
longevity expose flies, fruit flies 70 minutes heat

cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroid hormone itself, luteinizing hormone,
follicle stimulating hormone, hormones essentially drive production
hormones. won't get deeply, like learn FSH,
follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, please see episode
optimizing testosterone estrogen hubermanlab.com. looked prolactin
looked growth hormone. just cut chase tell effects
growth hormone. subjects two hour day, 80 degree Celsius protocol
experienced 16-fold increases growth hormone. measured growth hormone
sauna sauna growth hormone levels went 16 fold,
obviously enormous, turns statistically significant, effect. Now, one
important caveat here. Remember earlier talked people sauna


week versus two three times week versus four seven times week,
often people sauna, less likely die cardiovascular events
things sort? Well, case, effects sauna exposure growth
hormone actually went often people deliberate heat
exposure. mentioned, two hour day divided 30 minute
sessions protocol day one, day three, day seven week. found
day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared
sauna, effect basically cut two thirds. now instead getting 16-fold
increase, like three four-fold increase, still huge increase,
not great increase observed day one. day seven, tended
two, maybe threefold increase, not great one observed day
one. mean? happen? Well, reason happens
heat, just like cold, shock stressor system. context cold,
get cold ice bath, instance, five-degree ice bath, even 20
seconds, known increase norepinephrine 200%. can double amount
norepinephrine suddenly release brain body, actually can
positive effects. talk little bit,
every day, become cold adapted. circuit compares shelling core
body adjust ways either predict cold stimulus,
likely create thermogenetic mechanisms preparation cold exposure.
why, instance, people use deliberate cold exposure try increase
lipolysis, burning fat, oftentimes will get results while,
lot, lot, stop getting effects. talk lot avoiding cold adaptation,
goal, episode cold, similar mechanisms play here.
imagine subjects got sauna day one, whatever
pathways went measurement temperature shell changes temperature
core led big increases growth hormone, basically way just
describing result already told before. fact result diminished
time either means circuit not efficient communicating shift
temperature shift temperature less impact downstream
effectors not engaged extent wasn't much shock.
think latter explanation far likely. much akin weight

lungs burning heaving breathing hard, first day,
painful thing. every day every day, provided allow
recover, pretty soon running hill not breathing
hard. isn't much burning muscles, et cetera, et cetera. body
adapts. So, one key things understand use deliberate heat
exposure going use order try trigger massive increases
growth hormone, going need careful not than,
say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean
discouraging using deliberate heat exposure access growth hormone increases,
specific goal main goal, think reasonable say
don't want deliberate heat exposure, least not sort described here,
week, maybe even every 10 days, want
time events life, maybe hard workouts, trying push
fat loss barrier simply order access growth hormone peak levels,
maybe three times per month four times per month. start deliberate heat
exposure often, still get increases growth hormone, not going
nearly large increases growth hormone

01:04:32 Parameters Heat & Cold Exposure

going experience shock system deliberate heat exposure
every while. important way frame actually context cold.
might say, wait, episode heat heating, not cold,
really can't conversation heat heating without talking cold.
Because, mentioned earlier, cool outside body, shell,
actually heating body. fact, circuits control heating body
control cooling body, instance, activation things like shiver fat loss
response cold shiver, also controlled preoptic area
hypothalamus. can take step back start think take
design optimal protocol deliberate heat exposure looking cold,
mean. beautiful studies showing people get
cold body water, four degrees Celsius 20 seconds. mentioned earlier, will


cause 200 300% increase norepinephrine. Norepinephrine also called
noradrenaline. norepinephrine so-called catacholamines like dopamine
increased dramatically brief cold water exposure. increases
norepinephrine dopamine known long-lasting effects generally lead
improvements mood, focus, alertness. pretty significant. However,
aren't significant enough increase metabolism high degree. Whereas,
studies shown people go outside 16 degree Celsius weather
proper amount, fairly minimum amount clothing, can experience even
greater increases norepinephrine. time required order experience
increases six hours at, instance, 16 degrees Celsius. six

cetera, can use longer exposure less intense versions heat cold.
really find going work can safely.
confused start, please use parameters described earlier. First
all, check doctor. always, make sure somebody can

better get wet sauna dry sauna? optimal temperature? better
take hot shower hot bath hot tub? completely honest, depends
going able regularly, whether not want regularly,
specific goals are. purpose episode really arm
underlying mechanisms arm general parameters going
allow access results seeking. worth, personally


use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like

nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to

three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.
system becomes much efficient, people feel elevation baseline

reason love release certain neurochemicals, like
norepinephrine, et cetera, energy gives you. Maybe taste, hope,
well, caffeine ingestion also causes increases dopamine receptor concentration

further, dynorphine system not unique heat-induced stress. fact,
beautiful studies reviews role dynorphine stress

alcoholism causes changes dopamine receptors make difficult people
achieve pleasure things alcohol, even alcohol. kind
really diabolical nature addiction, thing initially brings pleasure,
eventually just required maintain baseline levels dopamine. talked
before, Dr. Anna Lembke, guest podcast, talked
pleasure pain balance exists within dopamine system. beautifully described
book "Dopamine Nation," way. Excellent book recommend people,
addicts not. Well, context pleasure pain clear pleasure

pain molecule, however, appears dynorphine. fact dynorphine

reason, excited fact deliberate heat exposure can leverage

cardiovascular function, also mental health. along lines,
wonderful study, again, published 2018. don't know why. guess 2018 big
year deliberate heat exposure studies. title study "Sauna Bathing "and

So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association

undergraduate. fact, graduate thesis thermal regulation.
time, thermal regulation wasn't really considered one hot topics neuroscience.
People focused things like memory consciousness. course
topics still vital interest many people many laboratories, thermal
regulation considered thing physiologists. Nowadays, not just
social media, not just landscape biohackers athletes, landscape
mental health, frankly, general ethos around health optimization, people
really interested heat cold. reason interested heat cold
lot science done animal models mice humans
translates immediately protocols anyone can use. Now, brief warning now
another brief warning later, anytime talking heating body,
need cautious, unlike cooling down, fairly broad
range cold temperatures can go damaging tissue, well,
don't get heat brain body much start getting realm
neuron damage, neuron's central nervous system, brain spinal

00:17:36 Heat Removal Circuits, Pre-Optic Hypothalamus (POA)

smart it. don't just say protect me. say also protect you.
now talk circuits heating up? happen? Many
probably experienced fever. happen? happens
go cold environment shivering, put coat
feel warmer. really going there? Well, basic circuit, meaning
neurons exist skin, brain, body communicate one
another allow heat need cool need to. going
throw little bit nomenclature, new words you. don't need memorize


words, except one, actually need memorize one acronym,
easy. called POA. remember POA, home free rest
episode, know aficionados people interested
getting little bit deeper mechanism. think important understand

understand circuit related heat preoptic area also can send
electrical signals amygdala, brain area often talked context

00:26:30 Protocols & Benefits Deliberate Heat Exposure

understand rest information tools follow. Next, like talk


use deliberate heat exposure, including sauna, tools well,
way understand heat heating changes biology. So, going learn
mechanism going learn tools. first like just
emphasize use deliberate heat exposure can powerful way
improve health longevity. wonderful study published
2018 includes lot data lot participants, lot different conditions,
instance, people sauna versus two three times week versus
four seven times week on, compares those. title study
Sauna Bathing Associated Reduced Cardiovascular Mortality Improves Risk
Prediction Men Women Prospective Cohort Study. one several papers
clearly demonstrate regular use sauna forms deliberate heat
exposure can reduce mortality cardiovascular events, also events, things
like stroke things basically can kill us. like much
related studies, yes, will provide link show notes,
involve lot participants. instance, particular paper, published
BMC Medicine, looked sample 1,688 participants mean age
63, range ages around 63, 51.4% women. rest
men. pretty nicely varied study terms populations looked
at. basically found often people sauna, better
health lower likelihood will die sort cardiovascular
event. mean sauna? need define parameters around
sauna, promise provide alternative ways access health
benefits observed related studies without need sauna,
'cause realize lot people don't access sauna. First off,
temperature ranges used pretty much studies going
talk about, unless say otherwise, 80 degrees Celsius, meaning 176
degrees Fahrenheit, 100 degrees Celsius, meaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
somewhere range. hot make sauna environment
get decide use tools? Well, will depend
tolerance heat, heat adapted are. Yes, people better sweating
others. time get better sweating. Meaning go
sauna frequently, become better sweater, not sweater wear,
verb sweater, get better sweating, dumping heat loss water.
going depend. recommend starting lower end temperature scale,


hot even lower temperature further. Now, long
people exposing hot environments? Anywhere five 20
minutes per session. soon learn, brief periods just five minutes
heat exposure can powerful stimulus heat exposure significantly great
enough you. 20 minutes can also beneficial, 80 100 degrees Celsius,
meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit general range
studies use. particular study, compared effects people
sauna week, two three times per week, four seven times per
week. saw really remarkable. observed people
went sauna two three times per week 27% less likely die
cardiovascular event people went sauna just week,
temperature levels duration talked earlier. can imagine,
duration, temperature levels related. people went hot
environments really uncomfortable them, maybe went five
minutes. Whereas, comfortable heat adapted given
environment tolerance heat just simply higher whatever reason, well
tended stay longer. can take sort average five 20 minute
range, today mainly going talk exposures 10 20 minutes
temperatures between, again, 80 degrees 100 degrees Celsius, 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 212 degrees Fahrenheit. data point fact going
sauna two three times per week really beneficial can lower mortality
cardiovascular events. fact, benefits even greater people
going sauna four seven times per week. people 50% less likely
die cardiovascular event compared people went sauna just
week. really impressive, frankly, encouraging studies. Certainly
caught eye encouraged start using deliberate heat exposure regular
basis. particularly nice study, related study that, again,
linked show notes, looked number potentially confounding
variables, things like whether not people smoked, things like whether not people
overweight, whether not tended exercise not exercise,
able separate variables. percentages described earlier, 27%
less likely die cardiovascular event went sauna two three
times week 50% less likely die cardiovascular event went
sauna four times per week, compared just week. effects really


seem consequence sauna exposure not effect
correlated sauna exposure, like going gym people working
seven times week also happen get sauna, quitting smoking right
time adopt sauna protocol, sorts things. now
additional analyses use sauna improving health, say
offsetting mortality, found not just reductions cardiovascular
events, called all-cause mortality. kind medical geek speak saying,
likely somebody die cardiovascular event, maybe also
event, health-related event, like cancer something
sort. every case, regular exposure sauna starting two three times
per week, way seven times per week, greatly improves, meaning statistically
significant improvements longevity sense people less likely die
cardiovascular events things kill us. many people
interested not just health, educating health-related tools

00:33:37 Tools & Conditions Deliberate Heat Exposure

general public, find really exciting. knowing know heat
impacts biology, probably shouldn't surprise us sauna type exposure
deliberate heat exposure incredible effects. get
biological mechanisms heat can impressive health effects, want
just talk use sauna tool emphasize don't use
sauna order get benefits. simply matter making sure shell
core heat properly bit, not much, not little, heat
up. no, not need carry thermometer around place thermometer
core. laboratory studies humans, really want know someone's
core temperature, basically try put thermal probe close core
can. typically done rectally mouth thermometer even nose.
don't need that. isn't laboratory study. ways create hot
environment heat shell core safely without
measure core temperature along. want that, guess, not
going provide protocol. question is, heating
environment? realize dry saunas, steam saunas,
infrared saunas, hot tubs, simply rooms crank


heat. also ways can increase shell core
temperature moving around lot wearing lot clothing.
nothing special one approaches protocols. just happens
sauna one convenient ways this. certainly studies
talked about, not just ones referenced before, studies
researched looking episode, makes sense use sauna,
hard, instance, create conditions five people go
jogging, wearing heavy sweaters hats, wool hats middle summer,
hard set conditions way controlled everybody. Whereas,
pretty straightforward sauna one several people just get
one uniformly hot environment. much easier study run. just
clear, temperature range important. want get 80 100 degrees
Celsius. Now know conversion Fahrenheit. could, however, immerse
hot tub hot water bath neck. another way approach it.
didn't access either those, also put hoodie wool hat
hoodie, like wrestlers do, actually buy one
plastic suits. literally called plastics wrestlers athletes
wish drop water weight will wear, go jogging that. will increase
shell core body temperature. Especially hot day,
course careful, hydrate don't overheat. Don't become excessively hyperthermic,
'cause can get heat stroke can potentially die. going use
sauna, often get question hot sauna be? Well now know.
long there? Five 20 minutes per session. Although, will talk
minute ways optimize hormone output, particular growth hormone output,
four brief sessions. maybe not continuous session. get
minutes. And, course, ask wet sauna, dry sauna. know
what? Doesn't matter. Use prefer. Many people ask me, "Well,
infrared sauna?" entire episode use light low level light
therapy, including infrared light. certain benefits skin organs
tissues body, used properly. understanding, least assessment,
infrared saunas don't get hot enough. don't get
80 100 degrees Celsius range. do, don't. end
situation got red light, low level light therapy stimulus, got
sauna not quite hot enough. lot ideas claims


work together order get improved benefits. personally stance,
based literature read, want get ranges 80 100
degrees Celsius start considering whether not also going include
red light therapies, et cetera. nothing special red light sauna. really
temperature sauna happen get into. tool? sauna?
stimulus? run wearing plastics hoodie wool hat get
sauna? going depend lot circumstances, budget,
access regular basis. lot like discussion
use cold. studies looked immersion cold water neck,
controlled situation can laboratory. not
explored cold showers much, just less data, walking around cold
environment. talk little bit data,

00:38:47 Deliberate Heat Exposure, Cortisol & Cardiovascular Health

soon learn, talk cold, actually talking
heating well. kind mechanisms activated brain body
allow various health benefits sauna forms deliberate heating? Well,
talked reduced risk cardiovascular event related mortality all-cause
mortality. soon learn, also tremendous benefits terms increases
growth hormone, reductions cortisol, et cetera. will detail those. happens
get hot environment? mechanisms allow
various health effects that? Well, shell, skin, senses that.
circuit described earlier, activates neurons POA, preoptic area,
turn activates mechanisms autonomic nervous system, like vasodilation.
blood flow increases. Plasma volume blood increases, stroke volume.
volume blood mobilized beat heart also increases.
heart rate increases anywhere 100 150 beats per minute. general
constellation effects looks lot like cardiovascular exercise. fact, intents
purposes, really cardiovascular exercise, except isn't mobilization
loading joints limbs things sort. course
additional benefits cardiovascular exercise relate impact ground,
improvements bone density, et cetera, et cetera. basically heart starts
beating, blood starts circulating, vasculature changes shape, literally,


accommodate increases heart rate blood volume. basically
getting cardiovascular workout hot environment, even just sitting down.
Another set positive effects related hot environments hormone
effects, shifts output hormones, adrenals possibly
testes ovaries even within brain. One striking examples
comes study published 2021. title study "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress "and Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." indeed, study was, case, just done men. just briefly describe
protocol used. men attend four sauna sessions 12 minutes
each. again, well within range five 20 minutes, 12 minutes. temperature
saunas 90 91 degrees Celsius. just quickly calculation,
admittedly, not head. 194 degrees Fahrenheit, four times.
Afterwards six-minute cool break get
cool water cold water 10 degrees, is, 10 degrees Celsius 50 degrees
Fahrenheit. measured hormones various times throughout study,
before, during, after. looked testosterone, looked DHEA,
androgen pathway. looked prolactin looked cortisol.
significant effects protocol just described cortisol, so-called stress

actually beneficial alertness energy. increasing
cortisol every 24 hours good thing, provided happens early day. Late day
increases cortisol associated depression. shown studies
Stanford elsewhere. major effect study significant decrease

many people suffer acute, meaning immediate, longterm stress,
looking ways control stress. Controlling cortisol tricky. episode

also just take cool shower cold shower afterwards, significant
effect lowering cortisol. tool not completely zero cost
tool, 'cause need heat water need access hot cold

extreme significant reduction cortisol observed
specific protocols, likely get similar result all. Now,
mentioned look hormones, just tell not
see significant shifts testosterone, prolactin, DHEA, et cetera, using protocol.
soon see, sauna protocols can impact hormones.
seeking use sauna reduce stress, think interesting
potentially useful research-backed protocol. again, will provide link

00:44:50 Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs), Molecular Mechanisms Heat Regulation

related protocol. benefits sauna? Well, talk
those, want talk context underlying mechanisms,
understand underlying mechanisms, can really tailor
sauna protocols particular needs. One dramatic important
effects going hot environment period time activation so-
called heat shock proteins, HSPs. Heat shock proteins protective mechanism
brain body rescue proteins otherwise misfold. mean
this? Well, familiar fact protein kitchen, like
steak piece chicken piece fish, heat up, changes texture.
Raw meat different cooked meat, quite blunt it. Heat changes
quality proteins, not just terms taste, way
configured. changes right molecular level. body goes


changes temperature day, talk changes, response
hot environments cold environments, heat shock proteins deployed go
rescue prevent changes proteins detrimental health.
least short term, activating heat shock proteins good thing. don't want
heat shock proteins activated long periods time, gets
problematic reasons. heat shock proteins, many
varieties, basically job traveling brain body making sure
cells contain proteins misfolding got heated much,
don't misfold, also, sort protective mechanism, making sure proteins
within cells brain body don't fold wrong ways. Again, describing
general terms, well established animal models humans,
sauna exposure sort described earlier activates heat shock proteins.
interesting studies carried animal models really nicely
mechanistically support role heat shock proteins benefits
deliberate heat exposure. studies done flies, meaning Drosophila,
fruit flies, 'cause great model organism, can delete genes add
genes easily. studies done mice. now also studies
carried humans, will talk those. One dramatic
examples always touted field deliberate heat exposure relates
longevity expose flies, fruit flies 70 minutes heat
stimulus would, obviously didn't kill them, activated heat shock proteins,
extend life 15% heat shock dependent way. Meaning made flies
didn't heat shock proteins, well didn't see extension life.

00:47:56 Longevity & Heat Exposure, FOXO3

one reasons use model organisms. not experiment
people. However, interesting studies done humans,
examining downstream molecular pathways deliberate heat exposure
point mechanisms deliberate heat exposure can help protect
different forms mortality, improve overall, possibly, want highlight
possibly, possibly extend life. One mechanism involves genetic program involving

00:52:30 Deliberate Cold & Heat Exposure & Metabolism

five 20 minutes per session sauna rough guide long
remain sauna. Now, study published just last year
mainly focused deliberate cold exposure. detailed quite extensively
episode cold. beautiful work Susanna Søberg. study looked
deliberate cold exposure, also sauna exposure. study found 57, yes, 57
minutes per week sauna exposure conjunction 11 minutes per week total
deliberate cold exposure threshold getting improvements metabolism

mention this? Well, interested increasing
metabolism, seem beneficial 11 minutes per week cold
exposure, again, divided across two sessions. not 11 minutes
once, shorter sessions, get 57 minutes minimum per week sauna
exposure, again, temperature ranges talked here. again,
not 57 minutes sauna once. 57 minutes total per week
minimum threshold. might divide three sessions 20 minutes.
again, don't think 57 magic number. 60, 64. probably
55. Remember biological systems not counting things off minute
minute, second second, least not cases.
interested improving metabolism, check episode cold, just take
Søberg Protocol, call it, 11 minutes total per week uncomfortably cold,
safe, cold exposure. uncomfortably cold means really, really want get

total per week divided across couple sessions 57 minutes per week, so,
deliberate heat exposure, again, uncomfortably, uncomfortably hot, excuse me,
safe stay in, probably divided across three sessions. Okay,
talked use sauna decrease cortisol. talked use sauna

00:54:48 Deliberate Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

lot, observed really quite significant. subjects
protocol, mention male female subjects study,
entire study lasted week. two hours sauna exposure day one,
day three, day seven week. measured lot different hormones,

experienced 16-fold increases growth hormone. measured growth hormone
sauna sauna growth hormone levels went 16 fold,
obviously enormous, turns statistically significant, effect. Now, one
important caveat here. Remember earlier talked people sauna


week versus two three times week versus four seven times week,
often people sauna, less likely die cardiovascular events
things sort? Well, case, effects sauna exposure growth
hormone actually went often people deliberate heat
exposure. mentioned, two hour day divided 30 minute
sessions protocol day one, day three, day seven week. found
day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared
sauna, effect basically cut two thirds. now instead getting 16-fold
increase, like three four-fold increase, still huge increase,
not great increase observed day one. day seven, tended
two, maybe threefold increase, not great one observed day
one. mean? happen? Well, reason happens

why, instance, people use deliberate cold exposure try increase

say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean

01:04:32 Parameters Heat & Cold Exposure

going experience shock system deliberate heat exposure

might say, wait, episode heat heating, not cold,
really can't conversation heat heating without talking cold.
Because, mentioned earlier, cool outside body, shell,

really want crank growth hormone, well, 30 minute four
times one day stimulus every while. really figure
using heat exposure for. one reasons people say,
better get wet sauna dry sauna? optimal temperature? better
take hot shower hot bath hot tub? completely honest, depends
going able regularly, whether not want regularly,
specific goals are. purpose episode really arm
underlying mechanisms arm general parameters going
allow access results seeking. worth, personally


use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to
Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli Healthy Men. "Is Difference?"
don't want go details study, pretty extensive
complicated, basically people sauna gave

exercise protocol led increased growth hormone
low blood sugar. Basically mixing matching various stimuli
increase growth hormone. found straightforward.
found sauna waiting period time
later day sauna again, didn't see increase growth hormone
times. First got big increase growth hormone less
sauna again. people exercise sauna, found
exercise stimulate growth hormone, following sauna not allow
get twice much growth hormone. general, anytime release growth
hormone, reduce likelihood going release growth hormone
later day. partially explains earlier study, people
growth hormone promoting protocol day one, day three didn't see
quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week
going beneficial number reasons described earlier. don't
want obsess much exact conditions need order get
greatest effect sauna treatment. just additional tweaks

sense want put

01:16:20 Tool: Hydration & Sauna

sauna exposure deliberate heat exposure second half day,
maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes
water not. going depend much sweat, meaning heat

sweat. Huge amount variation, general, one way approach
make sure drink least 16 ounces water every 10 minutes
happen sauna.

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.
system becomes much efficient, people feel elevation baseline
level mood, good happy event comes along, feel heightened
level happiness joy awe improved mood response that. not unlike
effects caffeine dopamine receptor described previously.
aren't familiar it, many drink caffeine love it. Part
reason love release certain neurochemicals, like
norepinephrine, et cetera, energy gives you. Maybe taste, hope,
well, caffeine ingestion also causes increases dopamine receptor concentration
efficacy. words, allows receptors dopamine work better
given amount dopamine release, experience pleasure motivation.


similar mechanism, within endorphin pathway. mean?
means little bit discomfort consequence deliberate heat exposure,
short term, doesn't feel good, definition, activating pathways
allowing feel molecules neural circuitries exist brain body
increase efficiency, placing better position joyful response
events life. confess excited data deliberate heat exposure
improvements chemical systems underlie good mood. just underscore
further, dynorphine system not unique heat-induced stress. fact,
beautiful studies reviews role dynorphine stress
depression, stress alcoholism, just brief aside, future will
whole episode alcohol alcoholism, turns chronic alcohol use
alcoholism causes changes dopamine receptors make difficult people
achieve pleasure things alcohol, even alcohol. kind
really diabolical nature addiction, thing initially brings pleasure,
eventually just required maintain baseline levels dopamine. talked
before, Dr. Anna Lembke, guest podcast, talked
pleasure pain balance exists within dopamine system. beautifully described
book "Dopamine Nation," way. Excellent book recommend people,
addicts not. Well, context pleasure pain clear pleasure
molecule is. actually molecule related motivation, dopamine.
pain molecule, however, appears dynorphine. fact dynorphine
dysregulated stress depression alcoholism relationship
dynorphine dopamine something take seriously.
reason, excited fact deliberate heat exposure can leverage
dynorphine system short term acute way allows mood improve
sauna exposure. So, don't like heat exposure, keep mind
lot observed positive effects biology relate metabolism,
cardiovascular function, also mental health. along lines,
wonderful study, again, published 2018. don't know why. guess 2018 big
year deliberate heat exposure studies. title study "Sauna Bathing "and
Risk Psychotic Disorders." prospective cohort study. Again,
provide link study. really interesting study explored relationship
mental health, people suffering various forms psychoses,
schizophrenia forms psychoses, use sauna. essentially


study looked large number subjects, 2,000 subjects,
no history psychotic disorders. classified three groups based
frequency sauna use, either week, two three times per week,
four seven times per week. call mind earlier study all-risk
mortality cardiovascular event risk. explored hazard ratio
psychosis specifically, meaning likely people develop psychotic
symptoms full blown psychotic illness, according frequency sauna session.
So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association
frequent sauna bathing future risk psychotic disorders
population. Now, not mean going sauna seven times per week
going prevent people becoming schizophrenic, necessarily,
psychotic episode, necessarily. course, frequent sauna use will related
health-promoting activities. study, previous study, went
great lengths order try limit so-called confounding variables. Now,
course, just one study, again, correlative, not causal, based
large number subjects included, plus rigor statistical analysis,
starting see general picture using sorts sauna protocols
described throughout episode, five 20 minutes so, done one seven times per
week associated general improvement cardiovascular health, general
improvement mental health, really points fact that, yes, sauna done
acutely three four times day, 30 minutes session separated cooling,
maybe getting cold bath, sure can potently increase growth hormone, done

encourage continue listen nonetheless, today going talk
specifically heat body cool body glabrous skin surfaces.
briefly, mechanism follows. palms hands, bottoms

types veins arteries don't capillaries them,
consequence, heat cold can move quickly palms hands,

without capillaries between, allows cooling blood heating blood much
quickly possible applying colder heat elsewhere body,
capillaries intervene veins arteries. AVAs, arteriovenous
anastomoses, can leveraged cool off core body temperature quickly.
key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half

core body, not cold constricts veins just palms
hands, bottoms feet, upper half face. So, not placing ice
packs necessarily, maybe placing cool towels bottoms feet, palms

00:26:30 Protocols & Benefits Deliberate Heat Exposure

understand rest information tools follow. Next, like talk


use deliberate heat exposure, including sauna, tools well,
way understand heat heating changes biology. So, going learn
mechanism going learn tools. first like just
emphasize use deliberate heat exposure can powerful way
improve health longevity. wonderful study published
2018 includes lot data lot participants, lot different conditions,
instance, people sauna versus two three times week versus
four seven times week on, compares those. title study
Sauna Bathing Associated Reduced Cardiovascular Mortality Improves Risk
Prediction Men Women Prospective Cohort Study. one several papers
clearly demonstrate regular use sauna forms deliberate heat
exposure can reduce mortality cardiovascular events, also events, things
like stroke things basically can kill us. like much
related studies, yes, will provide link show notes,
involve lot participants. instance, particular paper, published
BMC Medicine, looked sample 1,688 participants mean age
63, range ages around 63, 51.4% women. rest
men. pretty nicely varied study terms populations looked
at. basically found often people sauna, better
health lower likelihood will die sort cardiovascular
event. mean sauna? need define parameters around
sauna, promise provide alternative ways access health
benefits observed related studies without need sauna,
'cause realize lot people don't access sauna. First off,
temperature ranges used pretty much studies going
talk about, unless say otherwise, 80 degrees Celsius, meaning 176
degrees Fahrenheit, 100 degrees Celsius, meaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
somewhere range. hot make sauna environment
get decide use tools? Well, will depend
tolerance heat, heat adapted are. Yes, people better sweating
others. time get better sweating. Meaning go

verb sweater, get better sweating, dumping heat loss water.
going depend. recommend starting lower end temperature scale,


hot even lower temperature further. Now, long
people exposing hot environments? Anywhere five 20
minutes per session. soon learn, brief periods just five minutes
heat exposure can powerful stimulus heat exposure significantly great
enough you. 20 minutes can also beneficial, 80 100 degrees Celsius,
meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit general range
studies use. particular study, compared effects people
sauna week, two three times per week, four seven times per
week. saw really remarkable. observed people
went sauna two three times per week 27% less likely die
cardiovascular event people went sauna just week,
temperature levels duration talked earlier. can imagine,

tended stay longer. can take sort average five 20 minute
range, today mainly going talk exposures 10 20 minutes
temperatures between, again, 80 degrees 100 degrees Celsius, 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 212 degrees Fahrenheit. data point fact going
sauna two three times per week really beneficial can lower mortality
cardiovascular events. fact, benefits even greater people
going sauna four seven times per week. people 50% less likely
die cardiovascular event compared people went sauna just
week. really impressive, frankly, encouraging studies. Certainly
caught eye encouraged start using deliberate heat exposure regular
basis. particularly nice study, related study that, again,
linked show notes, looked number potentially confounding
variables, things like whether not people smoked, things like whether not people
overweight, whether not tended exercise not exercise,
able separate variables. percentages described earlier, 27%
less likely die cardiovascular event went sauna two three

sauna four times per week, compared just week. effects really


seem consequence sauna exposure not effect
correlated sauna exposure, like going gym people working
seven times week also happen get sauna, quitting smoking right
time adopt sauna protocol, sorts things. now
additional analyses use sauna improving health, say
offsetting mortality, found not just reductions cardiovascular
events, called all-cause mortality. kind medical geek speak saying,
likely somebody die cardiovascular event, maybe also
event, health-related event, like cancer something
sort. every case, regular exposure sauna starting two three times
per week, way seven times per week, greatly improves, meaning statistically
significant improvements longevity sense people less likely die
cardiovascular events things kill us. many people
interested not just health, educating health-related tools

after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try

neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment

schizophrenia forms psychoses, use sauna. essentially


study looked large number subjects, 2,000 subjects,
no history psychotic disorders. classified three groups based
frequency sauna use, either week, two three times per week,
four seven times per week. call mind earlier study all-risk

psychosis specifically, meaning likely people develop psychotic
symptoms full blown psychotic illness, according frequency sauna session.
So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association

specifically heat body cool body glabrous skin surfaces.
briefly, mechanism follows. palms hands, bottoms

key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half

00:26:30 Protocols & Benefits Deliberate Heat Exposure

understand rest information tools follow. Next, like talk


use deliberate heat exposure, including sauna, tools well,
way understand heat heating changes biology. So, going learn
mechanism going learn tools. first like just
emphasize use deliberate heat exposure can powerful way
improve health longevity. wonderful study published
2018 includes lot data lot participants, lot different conditions,
instance, people sauna versus two three times week versus
four seven times week on, compares those. title study
Sauna Bathing Associated Reduced Cardiovascular Mortality Improves Risk
Prediction Men Women Prospective Cohort Study. one several papers
clearly demonstrate regular use sauna forms deliberate heat
exposure can reduce mortality cardiovascular events, also events, things
like stroke things basically can kill us. like much
related studies, yes, will provide link show notes,
involve lot participants. instance, particular paper, published
BMC Medicine, looked sample 1,688 participants mean age
63, range ages around 63, 51.4% women. rest
men. pretty nicely varied study terms populations looked
at. basically found often people sauna, better
health lower likelihood will die sort cardiovascular
event. mean sauna? need define parameters around
sauna, promise provide alternative ways access health
benefits observed related studies without need sauna,
'cause realize lot people don't access sauna. First off,
temperature ranges used pretty much studies going
talk about, unless say otherwise, 80 degrees Celsius, meaning 176
degrees Fahrenheit, 100 degrees Celsius, meaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
somewhere range. hot make sauna environment
get decide use tools? Well, will depend
tolerance heat, heat adapted are. Yes, people better sweating
others. time get better sweating. Meaning go
sauna frequently, become better sweater, not sweater wear,
verb sweater, get better sweating, dumping heat loss water.
going depend. recommend starting lower end temperature scale,


hot even lower temperature further. Now, long
people exposing hot environments? Anywhere five 20
minutes per session. soon learn, brief periods just five minutes
heat exposure can powerful stimulus heat exposure significantly great
enough you. 20 minutes can also beneficial, 80 100 degrees Celsius,
meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit general range
studies use. particular study, compared effects people
sauna week, two three times per week, four seven times per
week. saw really remarkable. observed people
went sauna two three times per week 27% less likely die
cardiovascular event people went sauna just week,
temperature levels duration talked earlier. can imagine,
duration, temperature levels related. people went hot
environments really uncomfortable them, maybe went five
minutes. Whereas, comfortable heat adapted given
environment tolerance heat just simply higher whatever reason, well
tended stay longer. can take sort average five 20 minute
range, today mainly going talk exposures 10 20 minutes
temperatures between, again, 80 degrees 100 degrees Celsius, 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 212 degrees Fahrenheit. data point fact going
sauna two three times per week really beneficial can lower mortality
cardiovascular events. fact, benefits even greater people
going sauna four seven times per week. people 50% less likely
die cardiovascular event compared people went sauna just
week. really impressive, frankly, encouraging studies. Certainly
caught eye encouraged start using deliberate heat exposure regular
basis. particularly nice study, related study that, again,
linked show notes, looked number potentially confounding
variables, things like whether not people smoked, things like whether not people
overweight, whether not tended exercise not exercise,
able separate variables. percentages described earlier, 27%
less likely die cardiovascular event went sauna two three
times week 50% less likely die cardiovascular event went
sauna four times per week, compared just week. effects really


seem consequence sauna exposure not effect
correlated sauna exposure, like going gym people working
seven times week also happen get sauna, quitting smoking right
time adopt sauna protocol, sorts things. now
additional analyses use sauna improving health, say
offsetting mortality, found not just reductions cardiovascular
events, called all-cause mortality. kind medical geek speak saying,
likely somebody die cardiovascular event, maybe also
event, health-related event, like cancer something
sort. every case, regular exposure sauna starting two three times
per week, way seven times per week, greatly improves, meaning statistically
significant improvements longevity sense people less likely die
cardiovascular events things kill us. many people
interested not just health, educating health-related tools

00:33:37 Tools & Conditions Deliberate Heat Exposure

general public, find really exciting. knowing know heat
impacts biology, probably shouldn't surprise us sauna type exposure
deliberate heat exposure incredible effects. get
biological mechanisms heat can impressive health effects, want
just talk use sauna tool emphasize don't use
sauna order get benefits. simply matter making sure shell
core heat properly bit, not much, not little, heat
up. no, not need carry thermometer around place thermometer
core. laboratory studies humans, really want know someone's
core temperature, basically try put thermal probe close core
can. typically done rectally mouth thermometer even nose.
don't need that. isn't laboratory study. ways create hot
environment heat shell core safely without
measure core temperature along. want that, guess, not
going provide protocol. question is, heating
environment? realize dry saunas, steam saunas,
infrared saunas, hot tubs, simply rooms crank


heat. also ways can increase shell core
temperature moving around lot wearing lot clothing.
nothing special one approaches protocols. just happens
sauna one convenient ways this. certainly studies
talked about, not just ones referenced before, studies
researched looking episode, makes sense use sauna,
hard, instance, create conditions five people go
jogging, wearing heavy sweaters hats, wool hats middle summer,
hard set conditions way controlled everybody. Whereas,
pretty straightforward sauna one several people just get
one uniformly hot environment. much easier study run. just
clear, temperature range important. want get 80 100 degrees
Celsius. Now know conversion Fahrenheit. could, however, immerse
hot tub hot water bath neck. another way approach it.
didn't access either those, also put hoodie wool hat

specifically heat body cool body glabrous skin surfaces.
briefly, mechanism follows. palms hands, bottoms

capillaries intervene veins arteries. AVAs, arteriovenous
anastomoses, can leveraged cool off core body temperature quickly.
key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half

00:26:30 Protocols & Benefits Deliberate Heat Exposure

understand rest information tools follow. Next, like talk


use deliberate heat exposure, including sauna, tools well,
way understand heat heating changes biology. So, going learn
mechanism going learn tools. first like just
emphasize use deliberate heat exposure can powerful way
improve health longevity. wonderful study published
2018 includes lot data lot participants, lot different conditions,
instance, people sauna versus two three times week versus
four seven times week on, compares those. title study
Sauna Bathing Associated Reduced Cardiovascular Mortality Improves Risk
Prediction Men Women Prospective Cohort Study. one several papers
clearly demonstrate regular use sauna forms deliberate heat
exposure can reduce mortality cardiovascular events, also events, things
like stroke things basically can kill us. like much
related studies, yes, will provide link show notes,
involve lot participants. instance, particular paper, published
BMC Medicine, looked sample 1,688 participants mean age
63, range ages around 63, 51.4% women. rest
men. pretty nicely varied study terms populations looked
at. basically found often people sauna, better
health lower likelihood will die sort cardiovascular
event. mean sauna? need define parameters around
sauna, promise provide alternative ways access health
benefits observed related studies without need sauna,
'cause realize lot people don't access sauna. First off,
temperature ranges used pretty much studies going
talk about, unless say otherwise, 80 degrees Celsius, meaning 176
degrees Fahrenheit, 100 degrees Celsius, meaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
somewhere range. hot make sauna environment
get decide use tools? Well, will depend
tolerance heat, heat adapted are. Yes, people better sweating
others. time get better sweating. Meaning go
sauna frequently, become better sweater, not sweater wear,
verb sweater, get better sweating, dumping heat loss water.
going depend. recommend starting lower end temperature scale,


hot even lower temperature further. Now, long
people exposing hot environments? Anywhere five 20
minutes per session. soon learn, brief periods just five minutes
heat exposure can powerful stimulus heat exposure significantly great
enough you. 20 minutes can also beneficial, 80 100 degrees Celsius,
meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit general range
studies use. particular study, compared effects people
sauna week, two three times per week, four seven times per
week. saw really remarkable. observed people
went sauna two three times per week 27% less likely die
cardiovascular event people went sauna just week,
temperature levels duration talked earlier. can imagine,
duration, temperature levels related. people went hot
environments really uncomfortable them, maybe went five
minutes. Whereas, comfortable heat adapted given
environment tolerance heat just simply higher whatever reason, well
tended stay longer. can take sort average five 20 minute
range, today mainly going talk exposures 10 20 minutes
temperatures between, again, 80 degrees 100 degrees Celsius, 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 212 degrees Fahrenheit. data point fact going
sauna two three times per week really beneficial can lower mortality
cardiovascular events. fact, benefits even greater people
going sauna four seven times per week. people 50% less likely
die cardiovascular event compared people went sauna just
week. really impressive, frankly, encouraging studies. Certainly
caught eye encouraged start using deliberate heat exposure regular
basis. particularly nice study, related study that, again,
linked show notes, looked number potentially confounding
variables, things like whether not people smoked, things like whether not people
overweight, whether not tended exercise not exercise,
able separate variables. percentages described earlier, 27%
less likely die cardiovascular event went sauna two three

sauna four times per week, compared just week. effects really


seem consequence sauna exposure not effect
correlated sauna exposure, like going gym people working
seven times week also happen get sauna, quitting smoking right
time adopt sauna protocol, sorts things. now
additional analyses use sauna improving health, say
offsetting mortality, found not just reductions cardiovascular
events, called all-cause mortality. kind medical geek speak saying,
likely somebody die cardiovascular event, maybe also
event, health-related event, like cancer something
sort. every case, regular exposure sauna starting two three times
per week, way seven times per week, greatly improves, meaning statistically
significant improvements longevity sense people less likely die
cardiovascular events things kill us. many people
interested not just health, educating health-related tools

00:33:37 Tools & Conditions Deliberate Heat Exposure

general public, find really exciting. knowing know heat
impacts biology, probably shouldn't surprise us sauna type exposure
deliberate heat exposure incredible effects. get
biological mechanisms heat can impressive health effects, want
just talk use sauna tool emphasize don't use
sauna order get benefits. simply matter making sure shell
core heat properly bit, not much, not little, heat
up. no, not need carry thermometer around place thermometer
core. laboratory studies humans, really want know someone's
core temperature, basically try put thermal probe close core
can. typically done rectally mouth thermometer even nose.
don't need that. isn't laboratory study. ways create hot
environment heat shell core safely without
measure core temperature along. want that, guess, not
going provide protocol. question is, heating
environment? realize dry saunas, steam saunas,
infrared saunas, hot tubs, simply rooms crank


heat. also ways can increase shell core
temperature moving around lot wearing lot clothing.
nothing special one approaches protocols. just happens
sauna one convenient ways this. certainly studies
talked about, not just ones referenced before, studies
researched looking episode, makes sense use sauna,
hard, instance, create conditions five people go
jogging, wearing heavy sweaters hats, wool hats middle summer,
hard set conditions way controlled everybody. Whereas,
pretty straightforward sauna one several people just get
one uniformly hot environment. much easier study run. just
clear, temperature range important. want get 80 100 degrees

course careful, hydrate don't overheat. Don't become excessively hyperthermic,
'cause can get heat stroke can potentially die. going use

what? Doesn't matter. Use prefer. Many people ask me, "Well,
infrared sauna?" entire episode use light low level light
therapy, including infrared light. certain benefits skin organs

infrared saunas don't get hot enough. don't get
80 100 degrees Celsius range. do, don't. end
situation got red light, low level light therapy stimulus, got
sauna not quite hot enough. lot ideas claims


work together order get improved benefits. personally stance,
based literature read, want get ranges 80 100

Another set positive effects related hot environments hormone

testes ovaries even within brain. One striking examples
comes study published 2021. title study "Endocrine

this? Well, familiar fact protein kitchen, like

least short term, activating heat shock proteins good thing. don't want
heat shock proteins activated long periods time, gets
problematic reasons. heat shock proteins, many
varieties, basically job traveling brain body making sure
cells contain proteins misfolding got heated much,
don't misfold, also, sort protective mechanism, making sure proteins
within cells brain body don't fold wrong ways. Again, describing
general terms, well established animal models humans,
sauna exposure sort described earlier activates heat shock proteins.
interesting studies carried animal models really nicely
mechanistically support role heat shock proteins benefits
deliberate heat exposure. studies done flies, meaning Drosophila,
fruit flies, 'cause great model organism, can delete genes add

carried humans, will talk those. One dramatic
examples always touted field deliberate heat exposure relates

00:52:30 Deliberate Cold & Heat Exposure & Metabolism

five 20 minutes per session sauna rough guide long
remain sauna. Now, study published just last year
mainly focused deliberate cold exposure. detailed quite extensively
episode cold. beautiful work Susanna Søberg. study looked
deliberate cold exposure, also sauna exposure. study found 57, yes, 57
minutes per week sauna exposure conjunction 11 minutes per week total
deliberate cold exposure threshold getting improvements metabolism
increases brown fat, active fat tissue improves mitochondrial function
thermogenesis, meaning heating body. talk brown fat later.
mention this? Well, interested increasing
metabolism, seem beneficial 11 minutes per week cold
exposure, again, divided across two sessions. not 11 minutes
once, shorter sessions, get 57 minutes minimum per week sauna
exposure, again, temperature ranges talked here. again,
not 57 minutes sauna once. 57 minutes total per week
minimum threshold. might divide three sessions 20 minutes.
again, don't think 57 magic number. 60, 64. probably
55. Remember biological systems not counting things off minute
minute, second second, least not cases.
interested improving metabolism, check episode cold, just take
Søberg Protocol, call it, 11 minutes total per week uncomfortably cold,
safe, cold exposure. uncomfortably cold means really, really want get
shower ice bath whatever environment, can stay in, 11 minutes


total per week divided across couple sessions 57 minutes per week, so,
deliberate heat exposure, again, uncomfortably, uncomfortably hot, excuse me,
safe stay in, probably divided across three sessions. Okay,
talked use sauna decrease cortisol. talked use sauna

00:54:48 Deliberate Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

increase heat shock proteins. talked use sauna increase
FOXO3. Now like talk use sauna increase growth hormone. Growth
hormone hormone naturally secrete pituitary, also resides
near roof mouth. signal pituitary release growth hormone arrives
neurons exist hypothalamus. growth hormone releasing hormones,
believe not, called, stimulate release growth hormone
anterior pituitary gland general circulation, growth hormone impacts
metabolism growth cells tissues body. responsible tissue repair
well. growth spurt everyone experiences puberty
consequence growth hormone. describe study found

emphasize increases growth hormone not sort
observed puberty infants becoming adolescents adolescents growing
teenagers. levels growth hormone associated massive

talking here. yet, us age, go adolescence
teenage years young adulthood, starting early 30s
so, amount growth hormone secrete greatly diminished. Normally
release growth hormone every night, go sleep, particular early
part night sleep comprised mostly slow-wave sleep. age,
less growth hormone released slow wave sleep. various things
can promote release growth hormone, will talk

certain patterns food intake increase growth hormone. that,
want review data, one study particular, discovered certain
forms deliberate heat exposure using sauna can stimulate large increases
growth hormone output, people 30s, 40s, beyond
useful, may also useful people just trying stimulate release
growth hormone order to, instance, recover exercise stimulate fat
loss muscle growth repair particular injury. title paper "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Sauna Bathing." paper published 1986,
years ago, nonetheless serves basis lot studies
followed. let describe study. used 80 degree Celsius
environment, 176 degrees Fahrenheit, subjects sauna
30 minutes, four times per day. two hours total one day, 30 minutes
sauna, period cool rest, 30 minutes sauna again, cool rest, third,
fourth time. So, two hours total 80 degree Celsius environment.
lot, observed really quite significant. subjects
protocol, mention male female subjects study,
entire study lasted week. two hours sauna exposure day one,
day three, day seven week. measured lot different hormones,
cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroid hormone itself, luteinizing hormone,
follicle stimulating hormone, hormones essentially drive production
hormones. won't get deeply, like learn FSH,
follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, please see episode
optimizing testosterone estrogen hubermanlab.com. looked prolactin
looked growth hormone. just cut chase tell effects
growth hormone. subjects two hour day, 80 degree Celsius protocol
experienced 16-fold increases growth hormone. measured growth hormone
sauna sauna growth hormone levels went 16 fold,
obviously enormous, turns statistically significant, effect. Now, one
important caveat here. Remember earlier talked people sauna


week versus two three times week versus four seven times week,
often people sauna, less likely die cardiovascular events
things sort? Well, case, effects sauna exposure growth
hormone actually went often people deliberate heat
exposure. mentioned, two hour day divided 30 minute
sessions protocol day one, day three, day seven week. found
day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared
sauna, effect basically cut two thirds. now instead getting 16-fold
increase, like three four-fold increase, still huge increase,
not great increase observed day one. day seven, tended
two, maybe threefold increase, not great one observed day
one. mean? happen? Well, reason happens
heat, just like cold, shock stressor system. context cold,
get cold ice bath, instance, five-degree ice bath, even 20
seconds, known increase norepinephrine 200%. can double amount
norepinephrine suddenly release brain body, actually can
positive effects. talk little bit,
every day, become cold adapted. circuit compares shelling core
body adjust ways either predict cold stimulus,
likely create thermogenetic mechanisms preparation cold exposure.
why, instance, people use deliberate cold exposure try increase
lipolysis, burning fat, oftentimes will get results while,
lot, lot, stop getting effects. talk lot avoiding cold adaptation,
goal, episode cold, similar mechanisms play here.
imagine subjects got sauna day one, whatever
pathways went measurement temperature shell changes temperature
core led big increases growth hormone, basically way just
describing result already told before. fact result diminished
time either means circuit not efficient communicating shift

effectors not engaged extent wasn't much shock.
think latter explanation far likely. much akin weight

lungs burning heaving breathing hard, first day,
painful thing. every day every day, provided allow
recover, pretty soon running hill not breathing
hard. isn't much burning muscles, et cetera, et cetera. body
adapts. So, one key things understand use deliberate heat
exposure going use order try trigger massive increases
growth hormone, going need careful not than,
say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean
discouraging using deliberate heat exposure access growth hormone increases,
specific goal main goal, think reasonable say
don't want deliberate heat exposure, least not sort described here,
week, maybe even every 10 days, want
time events life, maybe hard workouts, trying push
fat loss barrier simply order access growth hormone peak levels,
maybe three times per month four times per month. start deliberate heat
exposure often, still get increases growth hormone, not going
nearly large increases growth hormone

01:04:32 Parameters Heat & Cold Exposure

going experience shock system deliberate heat exposure
every while. important way frame actually context cold.
might say, wait, episode heat heating, not cold,
really can't conversation heat heating without talking cold.
Because, mentioned earlier, cool outside body, shell,
actually heating body. fact, circuits control heating body
control cooling body, instance, activation things like shiver fat loss

design optimal protocol deliberate heat exposure looking cold,
mean. beautiful studies showing people get
cold body water, four degrees Celsius 20 seconds. mentioned earlier, will


cause 200 300% increase norepinephrine. Norepinephrine also called
noradrenaline. norepinephrine so-called catacholamines like dopamine
increased dramatically brief cold water exposure. increases
norepinephrine dopamine known long-lasting effects generally lead
improvements mood, focus, alertness. pretty significant. However,
aren't significant enough increase metabolism high degree. Whereas,
studies shown people go outside 16 degree Celsius weather
proper amount, fairly minimum amount clothing, can experience even
greater increases norepinephrine. time required order experience

cetera, can use longer exposure less intense versions heat cold.
really find going work can safely.
confused start, please use parameters described earlier. First
all, check doctor. always, make sure somebody can

really want crank growth hormone, well, 30 minute four
times one day stimulus every while. really figure
using heat exposure for. one reasons people say,
better get wet sauna dry sauna? optimal temperature? better
take hot shower hot bath hot tub? completely honest, depends
going able regularly, whether not want regularly,
specific goals are. purpose episode really arm
underlying mechanisms arm general parameters going
allow access results seeking. worth, personally


use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to

quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.

So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association

use deliberate heat exposure, including sauna, tools well,
way understand heat heating changes biology. So, going learn
mechanism going learn tools. first like just
emphasize use deliberate heat exposure can powerful way
improve health longevity. wonderful study published
2018 includes lot data lot participants, lot different conditions,
instance, people sauna versus two three times week versus
four seven times week on, compares those. title study
Sauna Bathing Associated Reduced Cardiovascular Mortality Improves Risk
Prediction Men Women Prospective Cohort Study. one several papers
clearly demonstrate regular use sauna forms deliberate heat
exposure can reduce mortality cardiovascular events, also events, things
like stroke things basically can kill us. like much
related studies, yes, will provide link show notes,
involve lot participants. instance, particular paper, published
BMC Medicine, looked sample 1,688 participants mean age
63, range ages around 63, 51.4% women. rest
men. pretty nicely varied study terms populations looked
at. basically found often people sauna, better
health lower likelihood will die sort cardiovascular
event. mean sauna? need define parameters around
sauna, promise provide alternative ways access health
benefits observed related studies without need sauna,
'cause realize lot people don't access sauna. First off,
temperature ranges used pretty much studies going
talk about, unless say otherwise, 80 degrees Celsius, meaning 176
degrees Fahrenheit, 100 degrees Celsius, meaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
somewhere range. hot make sauna environment
get decide use tools? Well, will depend
tolerance heat, heat adapted are. Yes, people better sweating
others. time get better sweating. Meaning go
sauna frequently, become better sweater, not sweater wear,
verb sweater, get better sweating, dumping heat loss water.
going depend. recommend starting lower end temperature scale,


hot even lower temperature further. Now, long
people exposing hot environments? Anywhere five 20
minutes per session. soon learn, brief periods just five minutes
heat exposure can powerful stimulus heat exposure significantly great
enough you. 20 minutes can also beneficial, 80 100 degrees Celsius,
meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit general range
studies use. particular study, compared effects people
sauna week, two three times per week, four seven times per
week. saw really remarkable. observed people
went sauna two three times per week 27% less likely die
cardiovascular event people went sauna just week,
temperature levels duration talked earlier. can imagine,
duration, temperature levels related. people went hot
environments really uncomfortable them, maybe went five
minutes. Whereas, comfortable heat adapted given
environment tolerance heat just simply higher whatever reason, well
tended stay longer. can take sort average five 20 minute
range, today mainly going talk exposures 10 20 minutes
temperatures between, again, 80 degrees 100 degrees Celsius, 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 212 degrees Fahrenheit. data point fact going
sauna two three times per week really beneficial can lower mortality
cardiovascular events. fact, benefits even greater people
going sauna four seven times per week. people 50% less likely
die cardiovascular event compared people went sauna just
week. really impressive, frankly, encouraging studies. Certainly
caught eye encouraged start using deliberate heat exposure regular
basis. particularly nice study, related study that, again,
linked show notes, looked number potentially confounding
variables, things like whether not people smoked, things like whether not people
overweight, whether not tended exercise not exercise,
able separate variables. percentages described earlier, 27%
less likely die cardiovascular event went sauna two three
times week 50% less likely die cardiovascular event went
sauna four times per week, compared just week. effects really


seem consequence sauna exposure not effect
correlated sauna exposure, like going gym people working
seven times week also happen get sauna, quitting smoking right
time adopt sauna protocol, sorts things. now
additional analyses use sauna improving health, say
offsetting mortality, found not just reductions cardiovascular
events, called all-cause mortality. kind medical geek speak saying,
likely somebody die cardiovascular event, maybe also
event, health-related event, like cancer something
sort. every case, regular exposure sauna starting two three times
per week, way seven times per week, greatly improves, meaning statistically
significant improvements longevity sense people less likely die
cardiovascular events things kill us. many people
interested not just health, educating health-related tools

00:33:37 Tools & Conditions Deliberate Heat Exposure

general public, find really exciting. knowing know heat
impacts biology, probably shouldn't surprise us sauna type exposure
deliberate heat exposure incredible effects. get
biological mechanisms heat can impressive health effects, want
just talk use sauna tool emphasize don't use
sauna order get benefits. simply matter making sure shell
core heat properly bit, not much, not little, heat
up. no, not need carry thermometer around place thermometer
core. laboratory studies humans, really want know someone's
core temperature, basically try put thermal probe close core
can. typically done rectally mouth thermometer even nose.
don't need that. isn't laboratory study. ways create hot
environment heat shell core safely without
measure core temperature along. want that, guess, not
going provide protocol. question is, heating
environment? realize dry saunas, steam saunas,
infrared saunas, hot tubs, simply rooms crank


heat. also ways can increase shell core
temperature moving around lot wearing lot clothing.
nothing special one approaches protocols. just happens
sauna one convenient ways this. certainly studies
talked about, not just ones referenced before, studies
researched looking episode, makes sense use sauna,
hard, instance, create conditions five people go
jogging, wearing heavy sweaters hats, wool hats middle summer,
hard set conditions way controlled everybody. Whereas,
pretty straightforward sauna one several people just get
one uniformly hot environment. much easier study run. just
clear, temperature range important. want get 80 100 degrees
Celsius. Now know conversion Fahrenheit. could, however, immerse
hot tub hot water bath neck. another way approach it.
didn't access either those, also put hoodie wool hat
hoodie, like wrestlers do, actually buy one
plastic suits. literally called plastics wrestlers athletes
wish drop water weight will wear, go jogging that. will increase
shell core body temperature. Especially hot day,
course careful, hydrate don't overheat. Don't become excessively hyperthermic,
'cause can get heat stroke can potentially die. going use
sauna, often get question hot sauna be? Well now know.
long there? Five 20 minutes per session. Although, will talk
minute ways optimize hormone output, particular growth hormone output,
four brief sessions. maybe not continuous session. get
minutes. And, course, ask wet sauna, dry sauna. know
what? Doesn't matter. Use prefer. Many people ask me, "Well,
infrared sauna?" entire episode use light low level light
therapy, including infrared light. certain benefits skin organs
tissues body, used properly. understanding, least assessment,
infrared saunas don't get hot enough. don't get
80 100 degrees Celsius range. do, don't. end
situation got red light, low level light therapy stimulus, got
sauna not quite hot enough. lot ideas claims


work together order get improved benefits. personally stance,
based literature read, want get ranges 80 100
degrees Celsius start considering whether not also going include
red light therapies, et cetera. nothing special red light sauna. really
temperature sauna happen get into. tool? sauna?
stimulus? run wearing plastics hoodie wool hat get
sauna? going depend lot circumstances, budget,
access regular basis. lot like discussion
use cold. studies looked immersion cold water neck,
controlled situation can laboratory. not
explored cold showers much, just less data, walking around cold
environment. talk little bit data,

00:38:47 Deliberate Heat Exposure, Cortisol & Cardiovascular Health

soon learn, talk cold, actually talking
heating well. kind mechanisms activated brain body
allow various health benefits sauna forms deliberate heating? Well,
talked reduced risk cardiovascular event related mortality all-cause
mortality. soon learn, also tremendous benefits terms increases
growth hormone, reductions cortisol, et cetera. will detail those. happens
get hot environment? mechanisms allow
various health effects that? Well, shell, skin, senses that.

turn activates mechanisms autonomic nervous system, like vasodilation.
blood flow increases. Plasma volume blood increases, stroke volume.
volume blood mobilized beat heart also increases.
heart rate increases anywhere 100 150 beats per minute. general
constellation effects looks lot like cardiovascular exercise. fact, intents
purposes, really cardiovascular exercise, except isn't mobilization

additional benefits cardiovascular exercise relate impact ground,
improvements bone density, et cetera, et cetera. basically heart starts
beating, blood starts circulating, vasculature changes shape, literally,


accommodate increases heart rate blood volume. basically
getting cardiovascular workout hot environment, even just sitting down.
Another set positive effects related hot environments hormone
effects, shifts output hormones, adrenals possibly
testes ovaries even within brain. One striking examples
comes study published 2021. title study "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress "and Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." indeed, study was, case, just done men. just briefly describe
protocol used. men attend four sauna sessions 12 minutes
each. again, well within range five 20 minutes, 12 minutes. temperature

admittedly, not head. 194 degrees Fahrenheit, four times.
Afterwards six-minute cool break get
cool water cold water 10 degrees, is, 10 degrees Celsius 50 degrees

many people suffer acute, meaning immediate, longterm stress,
looking ways control stress. Controlling cortisol tricky. episode

also just take cool shower cold shower afterwards, significant

specific protocols, likely get similar result all. Now,
mentioned look hormones, just tell not
see significant shifts testosterone, prolactin, DHEA, et cetera, using protocol.
soon see, sauna protocols can impact hormones.
seeking use sauna reduce stress, think interesting
potentially useful research-backed protocol. again, will provide link

00:44:50 Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs), Molecular Mechanisms Heat Regulation

related protocol. benefits sauna? Well, talk
those, want talk context underlying mechanisms,
understand underlying mechanisms, can really tailor
sauna protocols particular needs. One dramatic important
effects going hot environment period time activation so-
called heat shock proteins, HSPs. Heat shock proteins protective mechanism
brain body rescue proteins otherwise misfold. mean
this? Well, familiar fact protein kitchen, like
steak piece chicken piece fish, heat up, changes texture.
Raw meat different cooked meat, quite blunt it. Heat changes
quality proteins, not just terms taste, way
configured. changes right molecular level. body goes


changes temperature day, talk changes, response
hot environments cold environments, heat shock proteins deployed go
rescue prevent changes proteins detrimental health.
least short term, activating heat shock proteins good thing. don't want
heat shock proteins activated long periods time, gets
problematic reasons. heat shock proteins, many
varieties, basically job traveling brain body making sure
cells contain proteins misfolding got heated much,
don't misfold, also, sort protective mechanism, making sure proteins
within cells brain body don't fold wrong ways. Again, describing
general terms, well established animal models humans,
sauna exposure sort described earlier activates heat shock proteins.
interesting studies carried animal models really nicely
mechanistically support role heat shock proteins benefits
deliberate heat exposure. studies done flies, meaning Drosophila,
fruit flies, 'cause great model organism, can delete genes add
genes easily. studies done mice. now also studies
carried humans, will talk those. One dramatic
examples always touted field deliberate heat exposure relates
longevity expose flies, fruit flies 70 minutes heat

extend life 15% heat shock dependent way. Meaning made flies
didn't heat shock proteins, well didn't see extension life.

00:52:30 Deliberate Cold & Heat Exposure & Metabolism

five 20 minutes per session sauna rough guide long
remain sauna. Now, study published just last year
mainly focused deliberate cold exposure. detailed quite extensively

not 57 minutes sauna once. 57 minutes total per week

again, don't think 57 magic number. 60, 64. probably
55. Remember biological systems not counting things off minute

interested improving metabolism, check episode cold, just take
Søberg Protocol, call it, 11 minutes total per week uncomfortably cold,

obviously enormous, turns statistically significant, effect. Now, one
important caveat here. Remember earlier talked people sauna

often people sauna, less likely die cardiovascular events
things sort? Well, case, effects sauna exposure growth

day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared

significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to
Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli Healthy Men. "Is Difference?"
don't want go details study, pretty extensive
complicated, basically people sauna gave

low blood sugar. Basically mixing matching various stimuli
increase growth hormone. found straightforward.
found sauna waiting period time
later day sauna again, didn't see increase growth hormone
times. First got big increase growth hormone less
sauna again. people exercise sauna, found
exercise stimulate growth hormone, following sauna not allow
get twice much growth hormone. general, anytime release growth
hormone, reduce likelihood going release growth hormone
later day. partially explains earlier study, people
growth hormone promoting protocol day one, day three didn't see
quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week
going beneficial number reasons described earlier. don't
want obsess much exact conditions need order get
greatest effect sauna treatment. just additional tweaks

sense want put

01:16:20 Tool: Hydration & Sauna

sauna exposure deliberate heat exposure second half day,
maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes
water not. going depend much sweat, meaning heat

make sure drink least 16 ounces water every 10 minutes
happen sauna.

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.
system becomes much efficient, people feel elevation baseline
level mood, good happy event comes along, feel heightened
level happiness joy awe improved mood response that. not unlike
effects caffeine dopamine receptor described previously.
aren't familiar it, many drink caffeine love it. Part
reason love release certain neurochemicals, like
norepinephrine, et cetera, energy gives you. Maybe taste, hope,
well, caffeine ingestion also causes increases dopamine receptor concentration

given amount dopamine release, experience pleasure motivation.


similar mechanism, within endorphin pathway. mean?
means little bit discomfort consequence deliberate heat exposure,
short term, doesn't feel good, definition, activating pathways
allowing feel molecules neural circuitries exist brain body
increase efficiency, placing better position joyful response
events life. confess excited data deliberate heat exposure
improvements chemical systems underlie good mood. just underscore
further, dynorphine system not unique heat-induced stress. fact,
beautiful studies reviews role dynorphine stress

whole episode alcohol alcoholism, turns chronic alcohol use
alcoholism causes changes dopamine receptors make difficult people
achieve pleasure things alcohol, even alcohol. kind
really diabolical nature addiction, thing initially brings pleasure,
eventually just required maintain baseline levels dopamine. talked
before, Dr. Anna Lembke, guest podcast, talked
pleasure pain balance exists within dopamine system. beautifully described
book "Dopamine Nation," way. Excellent book recommend people,
addicts not. Well, context pleasure pain clear pleasure
molecule is. actually molecule related motivation, dopamine.
pain molecule, however, appears dynorphine. fact dynorphine
dysregulated stress depression alcoholism relationship
dynorphine dopamine something take seriously.
reason, excited fact deliberate heat exposure can leverage
dynorphine system short term acute way allows mood improve
sauna exposure. So, don't like heat exposure, keep mind
lot observed positive effects biology relate metabolism,
cardiovascular function, also mental health. along lines,
wonderful study, again, published 2018. don't know why. guess 2018 big
year deliberate heat exposure studies. title study "Sauna Bathing "and
Risk Psychotic Disorders." prospective cohort study. Again,
provide link study. really interesting study explored relationship
mental health, people suffering various forms psychoses,
schizophrenia forms psychoses, use sauna. essentially


study looked large number subjects, 2,000 subjects,
no history psychotic disorders. classified three groups based
frequency sauna use, either week, two three times per week,
four seven times per week. call mind earlier study all-risk
mortality cardiovascular event risk. explored hazard ratio
psychosis specifically, meaning likely people develop psychotic
symptoms full blown psychotic illness, according frequency sauna session.
So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association
frequent sauna bathing future risk psychotic disorders
population. Now, not mean going sauna seven times per week
going prevent people becoming schizophrenic, necessarily,
psychotic episode, necessarily. course, frequent sauna use will related
health-promoting activities. study, previous study, went
great lengths order try limit so-called confounding variables. Now,
course, just one study, again, correlative, not causal, based
large number subjects included, plus rigor statistical analysis,
starting see general picture using sorts sauna protocols
described throughout episode, five 20 minutes so, done one seven times per
week associated general improvement cardiovascular health, general
improvement mental health, really points fact that, yes, sauna done
acutely three four times day, 30 minutes session separated cooling,
maybe getting cold bath, sure can potently increase growth hormone, done

encourage continue listen nonetheless, today going talk
specifically heat body cool body glabrous skin surfaces.
briefly, mechanism follows. palms hands, bottoms
feet, upper half face overly specific types vasculature, meaning specific
types veins arteries don't capillaries them,
consequence, heat cold can move quickly palms hands,

AVAs arteriovenous astemoses. Basically veins arteries interacting directly
without capillaries between, allows cooling blood heating blood much
quickly possible applying colder heat elsewhere body,
capillaries intervene veins arteries. AVAs, arteriovenous
anastomoses, can leveraged cool off core body temperature quickly.
key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half
face contact cold surface fluid cold enough cool blood


core body, not cold constricts veins just palms
hands, bottoms feet, upper half face. So, not placing ice
packs necessarily, maybe placing cool towels bottoms feet, palms

hot even lower temperature further. Now, long
people exposing hot environments? Anywhere five 20
minutes per session. soon learn, brief periods just five minutes
heat exposure can powerful stimulus heat exposure significantly great
enough you. 20 minutes can also beneficial, 80 100 degrees Celsius,
meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit general range
studies use. particular study, compared effects people
sauna week, two three times per week, four seven times per
week. saw really remarkable. observed people
went sauna two three times per week 27% less likely die
cardiovascular event people went sauna just week,
temperature levels duration talked earlier. can imagine,
duration, temperature levels related. people went hot
environments really uncomfortable them, maybe went five
minutes. Whereas, comfortable heat adapted given
environment tolerance heat just simply higher whatever reason, well
tended stay longer. can take sort average five 20 minute
range, today mainly going talk exposures 10 20 minutes
temperatures between, again, 80 degrees 100 degrees Celsius, 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 212 degrees Fahrenheit. data point fact going
sauna two three times per week really beneficial can lower mortality
cardiovascular events. fact, benefits even greater people
going sauna four seven times per week. people 50% less likely
die cardiovascular event compared people went sauna just
week. really impressive, frankly, encouraging studies. Certainly
caught eye encouraged start using deliberate heat exposure regular
basis. particularly nice study, related study that, again,
linked show notes, looked number potentially confounding
variables, things like whether not people smoked, things like whether not people
overweight, whether not tended exercise not exercise,
able separate variables. percentages described earlier, 27%
less likely die cardiovascular event went sauna two three
times week 50% less likely die cardiovascular event went
sauna four times per week, compared just week. effects really


seem consequence sauna exposure not effect
correlated sauna exposure, like going gym people working
seven times week also happen get sauna, quitting smoking right
time adopt sauna protocol, sorts things. now
additional analyses use sauna improving health, say
offsetting mortality, found not just reductions cardiovascular
events, called all-cause mortality. kind medical geek speak saying,
likely somebody die cardiovascular event, maybe also
event, health-related event, like cancer something
sort. every case, regular exposure sauna starting two three times
per week, way seven times per week, greatly improves, meaning statistically
significant improvements longevity sense people less likely die
cardiovascular events things kill us. many people
interested not just health, educating health-related tools

00:33:37 Tools & Conditions Deliberate Heat Exposure

general public, find really exciting. knowing know heat
impacts biology, probably shouldn't surprise us sauna type exposure
deliberate heat exposure incredible effects. get
biological mechanisms heat can impressive health effects, want
just talk use sauna tool emphasize don't use
sauna order get benefits. simply matter making sure shell
core heat properly bit, not much, not little, heat
up. no, not need carry thermometer around place thermometer
core. laboratory studies humans, really want know someone's
core temperature, basically try put thermal probe close core
can. typically done rectally mouth thermometer even nose.
don't need that. isn't laboratory study. ways create hot
environment heat shell core safely without
measure core temperature along. want that, guess, not
going provide protocol. question is, heating
environment? realize dry saunas, steam saunas,
infrared saunas, hot tubs, simply rooms crank


heat. also ways can increase shell core
temperature moving around lot wearing lot clothing.
nothing special one approaches protocols. just happens
sauna one convenient ways this. certainly studies
talked about, not just ones referenced before, studies
researched looking episode, makes sense use sauna,
hard, instance, create conditions five people go
jogging, wearing heavy sweaters hats, wool hats middle summer,
hard set conditions way controlled everybody. Whereas,
pretty straightforward sauna one several people just get
one uniformly hot environment. much easier study run. just
clear, temperature range important. want get 80 100 degrees
Celsius. Now know conversion Fahrenheit. could, however, immerse
hot tub hot water bath neck. another way approach it.
didn't access either those, also put hoodie wool hat
hoodie, like wrestlers do, actually buy one
plastic suits. literally called plastics wrestlers athletes
wish drop water weight will wear, go jogging that. will increase
shell core body temperature. Especially hot day,
course careful, hydrate don't overheat. Don't become excessively hyperthermic,
'cause can get heat stroke can potentially die. going use
sauna, often get question hot sauna be? Well now know.
long there? Five 20 minutes per session. Although, will talk
minute ways optimize hormone output, particular growth hormone output,
four brief sessions. maybe not continuous session. get
minutes. And, course, ask wet sauna, dry sauna. know
what? Doesn't matter. Use prefer. Many people ask me, "Well,
infrared sauna?" entire episode use light low level light
therapy, including infrared light. certain benefits skin organs
tissues body, used properly. understanding, least assessment,
infrared saunas don't get hot enough. don't get
80 100 degrees Celsius range. do, don't. end
situation got red light, low level light therapy stimulus, got
sauna not quite hot enough. lot ideas claims


work together order get improved benefits. personally stance,
based literature read, want get ranges 80 100
degrees Celsius start considering whether not also going include

additional analyses use sauna improving health, say

00:33:37 Tools & Conditions Deliberate Heat Exposure

general public, find really exciting. knowing know heat
impacts biology, probably shouldn't surprise us sauna type exposure
deliberate heat exposure incredible effects. get
biological mechanisms heat can impressive health effects, want
just talk use sauna tool emphasize don't use
sauna order get benefits. simply matter making sure shell
core heat properly bit, not much, not little, heat
up. no, not need carry thermometer around place thermometer
core. laboratory studies humans, really want know someone's
core temperature, basically try put thermal probe close core
can. typically done rectally mouth thermometer even nose.
don't need that. isn't laboratory study. ways create hot
environment heat shell core safely without
measure core temperature along. want that, guess, not

environment? realize dry saunas, steam saunas,
infrared saunas, hot tubs, simply rooms crank


heat. also ways can increase shell core
temperature moving around lot wearing lot clothing.
nothing special one approaches protocols. just happens
sauna one convenient ways this. certainly studies
talked about, not just ones referenced before, studies
researched looking episode, makes sense use sauna,
hard, instance, create conditions five people go
jogging, wearing heavy sweaters hats, wool hats middle summer,
hard set conditions way controlled everybody. Whereas,
pretty straightforward sauna one several people just get
one uniformly hot environment. much easier study run. just
clear, temperature range important. want get 80 100 degrees

what? Doesn't matter. Use prefer. Many people ask me, "Well,
infrared sauna?" entire episode use light low level light

infrared saunas don't get hot enough. don't get
80 100 degrees Celsius range. do, don't. end
situation got red light, low level light therapy stimulus, got
sauna not quite hot enough. lot ideas claims


work together order get improved benefits. personally stance,

getting cardiovascular workout hot environment, even just sitting down.
Another set positive effects related hot environments hormone

testes ovaries even within brain. One striking examples
comes study published 2021. title study "Endocrine

this? Well, familiar fact protein kitchen, like

least short term, activating heat shock proteins good thing. don't want

problematic reasons. heat shock proteins, many
varieties, basically job traveling brain body making sure
cells contain proteins misfolding got heated much,
don't misfold, also, sort protective mechanism, making sure proteins
within cells brain body don't fold wrong ways. Again, describing
general terms, well established animal models humans,
sauna exposure sort described earlier activates heat shock proteins.
interesting studies carried animal models really nicely
mechanistically support role heat shock proteins benefits
deliberate heat exposure. studies done flies, meaning Drosophila,
fruit flies, 'cause great model organism, can delete genes add

carried humans, will talk those. One dramatic
examples always touted field deliberate heat exposure relates

exposure going use order try trigger massive increases
growth hormone, going need careful not than,
say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean
discouraging using deliberate heat exposure access growth hormone increases,
specific goal main goal, think reasonable say
don't want deliberate heat exposure, least not sort described here,
week, maybe even every 10 days, want
time events life, maybe hard workouts, trying push
fat loss barrier simply order access growth hormone peak levels,
maybe three times per month four times per month. start deliberate heat
exposure often, still get increases growth hormone, not going
nearly large increases growth hormone

01:04:32 Parameters Heat & Cold Exposure

going experience shock system deliberate heat exposure
every while. important way frame actually context cold.
might say, wait, episode heat heating, not cold,
really can't conversation heat heating without talking cold.
Because, mentioned earlier, cool outside body, shell,
actually heating body. fact, circuits control heating body
control cooling body, instance, activation things like shiver fat loss
response cold shiver, also controlled preoptic area
hypothalamus. can take step back start think take
design optimal protocol deliberate heat exposure looking cold,
mean. beautiful studies showing people get
cold body water, four degrees Celsius 20 seconds. mentioned earlier, will


cause 200 300% increase norepinephrine. Norepinephrine also called
noradrenaline. norepinephrine so-called catacholamines like dopamine
increased dramatically brief cold water exposure. increases
norepinephrine dopamine known long-lasting effects generally lead
improvements mood, focus, alertness. pretty significant. However,
aren't significant enough increase metabolism high degree. Whereas,
studies shown people go outside 16 degree Celsius weather
proper amount, fairly minimum amount clothing, can experience even
greater increases norepinephrine. time required order experience
increases six hours at, instance, 16 degrees Celsius. six
hours day cold, can turn air conditioning
environment make very, cold, fine. basically describing
can sort bookend parameters can use. can use brief
exposure cold heat order stimulate heat shock proteins, growth hormone, et
cetera, can use longer exposure less intense versions heat cold.
really find going work can safely.
confused start, please use parameters described earlier. First
all, check doctor. always, make sure somebody can
deliberate cold heat exposure safely, 80 100 degrees Celsius, meaning
176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit, keep repeating over,
'cause know somebody's going ask, even though repeat over,
fine, delighted keep saying it, respond someone asks again. Well,
parameters going kind bookend terms intensity
heat stimulus. long? Well, heard earlier, five 20 minutes. not start
five ramp 10 15? feeling really bold
really want crank growth hormone, well, 30 minute four
times one day stimulus every while. really figure
using heat exposure for. one reasons people say,
better get wet sauna dry sauna? optimal temperature? better
take hot shower hot bath hot tub? completely honest, depends
going able regularly, whether not want regularly,
specific goals are. purpose episode really arm
underlying mechanisms arm general parameters going
allow access results seeking. worth, personally


use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to
Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli Healthy Men. "Is Difference?"
don't want go details study, pretty extensive
complicated, basically people sauna gave

found sauna waiting period time
later day sauna again, didn't see increase growth hormone
times. First got big increase growth hormone less
sauna again. people exercise sauna, found
exercise stimulate growth hormone, following sauna not allow
get twice much growth hormone. general, anytime release growth
hormone, reduce likelihood going release growth hormone
later day. partially explains earlier study, people
growth hormone promoting protocol day one, day three didn't see
quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week
going beneficial number reasons described earlier. don't
want obsess much exact conditions need order get
greatest effect sauna treatment. just additional tweaks
related food intake low level hypoglycemia exercise, wanted
leverage, could. decreases body temperature tend aid transition

sense want put

01:16:20 Tool: Hydration & Sauna

sauna exposure deliberate heat exposure second half day,
maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes
water not. going depend much sweat, meaning heat

sweat. Huge amount variation, general, one way approach
make sure drink least 16 ounces water every 10 minutes
happen sauna.

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.
system becomes much efficient, people feel elevation baseline
level mood, good happy event comes along, feel heightened
level happiness joy awe improved mood response that. not unlike
effects caffeine dopamine receptor described previously.
aren't familiar it, many drink caffeine love it. Part
reason love release certain neurochemicals, like
norepinephrine, et cetera, energy gives you. Maybe taste, hope,
well, caffeine ingestion also causes increases dopamine receptor concentration
efficacy. words, allows receptors dopamine work better
given amount dopamine release, experience pleasure motivation.


similar mechanism, within endorphin pathway. mean?
means little bit discomfort consequence deliberate heat exposure,
short term, doesn't feel good, definition, activating pathways
allowing feel molecules neural circuitries exist brain body
increase efficiency, placing better position joyful response
events life. confess excited data deliberate heat exposure
improvements chemical systems underlie good mood. just underscore
further, dynorphine system not unique heat-induced stress. fact,
beautiful studies reviews role dynorphine stress
depression, stress alcoholism, just brief aside, future will
whole episode alcohol alcoholism, turns chronic alcohol use
alcoholism causes changes dopamine receptors make difficult people
achieve pleasure things alcohol, even alcohol. kind
really diabolical nature addiction, thing initially brings pleasure,
eventually just required maintain baseline levels dopamine. talked
before, Dr. Anna Lembke, guest podcast, talked
pleasure pain balance exists within dopamine system. beautifully described
book "Dopamine Nation," way. Excellent book recommend people,
addicts not. Well, context pleasure pain clear pleasure
molecule is. actually molecule related motivation, dopamine.
pain molecule, however, appears dynorphine. fact dynorphine
dysregulated stress depression alcoholism relationship
dynorphine dopamine something take seriously.
reason, excited fact deliberate heat exposure can leverage
dynorphine system short term acute way allows mood improve
sauna exposure. So, don't like heat exposure, keep mind
lot observed positive effects biology relate metabolism,
cardiovascular function, also mental health. along lines,
wonderful study, again, published 2018. don't know why. guess 2018 big
year deliberate heat exposure studies. title study "Sauna Bathing "and
Risk Psychotic Disorders." prospective cohort study. Again,
provide link study. really interesting study explored relationship
mental health, people suffering various forms psychoses,
schizophrenia forms psychoses, use sauna. essentially


study looked large number subjects, 2,000 subjects,
no history psychotic disorders. classified three groups based
frequency sauna use, either week, two three times per week,
four seven times per week. call mind earlier study all-risk
mortality cardiovascular event risk. explored hazard ratio
psychosis specifically, meaning likely people develop psychotic
symptoms full blown psychotic illness, according frequency sauna session.
So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association
frequent sauna bathing future risk psychotic disorders
population. Now, not mean going sauna seven times per week
going prevent people becoming schizophrenic, necessarily,
psychotic episode, necessarily. course, frequent sauna use will related
health-promoting activities. study, previous study, went
great lengths order try limit so-called confounding variables. Now,
course, just one study, again, correlative, not causal, based
large number subjects included, plus rigor statistical analysis,
starting see general picture using sorts sauna protocols
described throughout episode, five 20 minutes so, done one seven times per
week associated general improvement cardiovascular health, general
improvement mental health, really points fact that, yes, sauna done
acutely three four times day, 30 minutes session separated cooling,
maybe getting cold bath, sure can potently increase growth hormone, done

key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half

key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half

00:52:30 Deliberate Cold & Heat Exposure & Metabolism

five 20 minutes per session sauna rough guide long

mainly focused deliberate cold exposure. detailed quite extensively

mention this? Well, interested increasing

once, shorter sessions, get 57 minutes minimum per week sauna

not 57 minutes sauna once. 57 minutes total per week

again, don't think 57 magic number. 60, 64. probably
55. Remember biological systems not counting things off minute

experienced 16-fold increases growth hormone. measured growth hormone
sauna sauna growth hormone levels went 16 fold,
obviously enormous, turns statistically significant, effect. Now, one
important caveat here. Remember earlier talked people sauna


week versus two three times week versus four seven times week,
often people sauna, less likely die cardiovascular events
things sort? Well, case, effects sauna exposure growth

day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared
sauna, effect basically cut two thirds. now instead getting 16-fold
increase, like three four-fold increase, still huge increase,
not great increase observed day one. day seven, tended

say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean
discouraging using deliberate heat exposure access growth hormone increases,
specific goal main goal, think reasonable say
don't want deliberate heat exposure, least not sort described here,

time events life, maybe hard workouts, trying push
fat loss barrier simply order access growth hormone peak levels,
maybe three times per month four times per month. start deliberate heat

cetera, can use longer exposure less intense versions heat cold.
really find going work can safely.
confused start, please use parameters described earlier. First
all, check doctor. always, make sure somebody can
deliberate cold heat exposure safely, 80 100 degrees Celsius, meaning
176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit, keep repeating over,
'cause know somebody's going ask, even though repeat over,
fine, delighted keep saying it, respond someone asks again. Well,
parameters going kind bookend terms intensity

five ramp 10 15? feeling really bold
really want crank growth hormone, well, 30 minute four
times one day stimulus every while. really figure
using heat exposure for. one reasons people say,
better get wet sauna dry sauna? optimal temperature? better
take hot shower hot bath hot tub? completely honest, depends
going able regularly, whether not want regularly,
specific goals are. purpose episode really arm
underlying mechanisms arm general parameters going
allow access results seeking. worth, personally


use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to
Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli Healthy Men. "Is Difference?"
don't want go details study, pretty extensive
complicated, basically people sauna gave

found sauna waiting period time
later day sauna again, didn't see increase growth hormone

sauna again. people exercise sauna, found
exercise stimulate growth hormone, following sauna not allow
get twice much growth hormone. general, anytime release growth
hormone, reduce likelihood going release growth hormone
later day. partially explains earlier study, people
growth hormone promoting protocol day one, day three didn't see
quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week
going beneficial number reasons described earlier. don't
want obsess much exact conditions need order get
greatest effect sauna treatment. just additional tweaks

leverage, could. decreases body temperature tend aid transition

sense want put

01:16:20 Tool: Hydration & Sauna

sauna exposure deliberate heat exposure second half day,
maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes
water not. going depend much sweat, meaning heat

sweat. Huge amount variation, general, one way approach
make sure drink least 16 ounces water every 10 minutes

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.
system becomes much efficient, people feel elevation baseline
level mood, good happy event comes along, feel heightened
level happiness joy awe improved mood response that. not unlike
effects caffeine dopamine receptor described previously.
aren't familiar it, many drink caffeine love it. Part
reason love release certain neurochemicals, like
norepinephrine, et cetera, energy gives you. Maybe taste, hope,
well, caffeine ingestion also causes increases dopamine receptor concentration

given amount dopamine release, experience pleasure motivation.


similar mechanism, within endorphin pathway. mean?
means little bit discomfort consequence deliberate heat exposure,
short term, doesn't feel good, definition, activating pathways
allowing feel molecules neural circuitries exist brain body
increase efficiency, placing better position joyful response
events life. confess excited data deliberate heat exposure
improvements chemical systems underlie good mood. just underscore
further, dynorphine system not unique heat-induced stress. fact,
beautiful studies reviews role dynorphine stress
depression, stress alcoholism, just brief aside, future will
whole episode alcohol alcoholism, turns chronic alcohol use
alcoholism causes changes dopamine receptors make difficult people
achieve pleasure things alcohol, even alcohol. kind
really diabolical nature addiction, thing initially brings pleasure,
eventually just required maintain baseline levels dopamine. talked
before, Dr. Anna Lembke, guest podcast, talked
pleasure pain balance exists within dopamine system. beautifully described
book "Dopamine Nation," way. Excellent book recommend people,
addicts not. Well, context pleasure pain clear pleasure
molecule is. actually molecule related motivation, dopamine.
pain molecule, however, appears dynorphine. fact dynorphine
dysregulated stress depression alcoholism relationship
dynorphine dopamine something take seriously.
reason, excited fact deliberate heat exposure can leverage
dynorphine system short term acute way allows mood improve
sauna exposure. So, don't like heat exposure, keep mind
lot observed positive effects biology relate metabolism,
cardiovascular function, also mental health. along lines,
wonderful study, again, published 2018. don't know why. guess 2018 big
year deliberate heat exposure studies. title study "Sauna Bathing "and
Risk Psychotic Disorders." prospective cohort study. Again,
provide link study. really interesting study explored relationship
mental health, people suffering various forms psychoses,
schizophrenia forms psychoses, use sauna. essentially


study looked large number subjects, 2,000 subjects,
no history psychotic disorders. classified three groups based
frequency sauna use, either week, two three times per week,
four seven times per week. call mind earlier study all-risk
mortality cardiovascular event risk. explored hazard ratio
psychosis specifically, meaning likely people develop psychotic
symptoms full blown psychotic illness, according frequency sauna session.
So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association
frequent sauna bathing future risk psychotic disorders
population. Now, not mean going sauna seven times per week
going prevent people becoming schizophrenic, necessarily,
psychotic episode, necessarily. course, frequent sauna use will related
health-promoting activities. study, previous study, went
great lengths order try limit so-called confounding variables. Now,
course, just one study, again, correlative, not causal, based
large number subjects included, plus rigor statistical analysis,
starting see general picture using sorts sauna protocols
described throughout episode, five 20 minutes so, done one seven times per
week associated general improvement cardiovascular health, general
improvement mental health, really points fact that, yes, sauna done
acutely three four times day, 30 minutes session separated cooling,
maybe getting cold bath, sure can potently increase growth hormone, done

key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half

endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-

00:52:30 Deliberate Cold & Heat Exposure & Metabolism

five 20 minutes per session sauna rough guide long
remain sauna. Now, study published just last year
mainly focused deliberate cold exposure. detailed quite extensively
episode cold. beautiful work Susanna Søberg. study looked
deliberate cold exposure, also sauna exposure. study found 57, yes, 57
minutes per week sauna exposure conjunction 11 minutes per week total
deliberate cold exposure threshold getting improvements metabolism
increases brown fat, active fat tissue improves mitochondrial function
thermogenesis, meaning heating body. talk brown fat later.
mention this? Well, interested increasing
metabolism, seem beneficial 11 minutes per week cold
exposure, again, divided across two sessions. not 11 minutes
once, shorter sessions, get 57 minutes minimum per week sauna
exposure, again, temperature ranges talked here. again,
not 57 minutes sauna once. 57 minutes total per week
minimum threshold. might divide three sessions 20 minutes.
again, don't think 57 magic number. 60, 64. probably
55. Remember biological systems not counting things off minute
minute, second second, least not cases.
interested improving metabolism, check episode cold, just take
Søberg Protocol, call it, 11 minutes total per week uncomfortably cold,
safe, cold exposure. uncomfortably cold means really, really want get
shower ice bath whatever environment, can stay in, 11 minutes


total per week divided across couple sessions 57 minutes per week, so,
deliberate heat exposure, again, uncomfortably, uncomfortably hot, excuse me,
safe stay in, probably divided across three sessions. Okay,
talked use sauna decrease cortisol. talked use sauna

00:54:48 Deliberate Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

increase heat shock proteins. talked use sauna increase

growth hormone output, people 30s, 40s, beyond
useful, may also useful people just trying stimulate release
growth hormone order to, instance, recover exercise stimulate fat
loss muscle growth repair particular injury. title paper "Endocrine

years ago, nonetheless serves basis lot studies
followed. let describe study. used 80 degree Celsius
environment, 176 degrees Fahrenheit, subjects sauna
30 minutes, four times per day. two hours total one day, 30 minutes
sauna, period cool rest, 30 minutes sauna again, cool rest, third,
fourth time. So, two hours total 80 degree Celsius environment.
lot, observed really quite significant. subjects
protocol, mention male female subjects study,
entire study lasted week. two hours sauna exposure day one,
day three, day seven week. measured lot different hormones,
cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroid hormone itself, luteinizing hormone,
follicle stimulating hormone, hormones essentially drive production
hormones. won't get deeply, like learn FSH,
follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, please see episode
optimizing testosterone estrogen hubermanlab.com. looked prolactin
looked growth hormone. just cut chase tell effects
growth hormone. subjects two hour day, 80 degree Celsius protocol
experienced 16-fold increases growth hormone. measured growth hormone
sauna sauna growth hormone levels went 16 fold,
obviously enormous, turns statistically significant, effect. Now, one
important caveat here. Remember earlier talked people sauna


week versus two three times week versus four seven times week,
often people sauna, less likely die cardiovascular events
things sort? Well, case, effects sauna exposure growth
hormone actually went often people deliberate heat
exposure. mentioned, two hour day divided 30 minute
sessions protocol day one, day three, day seven week. found
day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared
sauna, effect basically cut two thirds. now instead getting 16-fold
increase, like three four-fold increase, still huge increase,
not great increase observed day one. day seven, tended
two, maybe threefold increase, not great one observed day
one. mean? happen? Well, reason happens
heat, just like cold, shock stressor system. context cold,
get cold ice bath, instance, five-degree ice bath, even 20
seconds, known increase norepinephrine 200%. can double amount
norepinephrine suddenly release brain body, actually can
positive effects. talk little bit,
every day, become cold adapted. circuit compares shelling core
body adjust ways either predict cold stimulus,
likely create thermogenetic mechanisms preparation cold exposure.
why, instance, people use deliberate cold exposure try increase
lipolysis, burning fat, oftentimes will get results while,
lot, lot, stop getting effects. talk lot avoiding cold adaptation,
goal, episode cold, similar mechanisms play here.
imagine subjects got sauna day one, whatever
pathways went measurement temperature shell changes temperature
core led big increases growth hormone, basically way just
describing result already told before. fact result diminished
time either means circuit not efficient communicating shift
temperature shift temperature less impact downstream
effectors not engaged extent wasn't much shock.
think latter explanation far likely. much akin weight
training cardiovascular exercise, run hill fast, instance,


lungs burning heaving breathing hard, first day,
painful thing. every day every day, provided allow
recover, pretty soon running hill not breathing
hard. isn't much burning muscles, et cetera, et cetera. body
adapts. So, one key things understand use deliberate heat
exposure going use order try trigger massive increases
growth hormone, going need careful not than,
say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean
discouraging using deliberate heat exposure access growth hormone increases,
specific goal main goal, think reasonable say
don't want deliberate heat exposure, least not sort described here,
week, maybe even every 10 days, want
time events life, maybe hard workouts, trying push
fat loss barrier simply order access growth hormone peak levels,
maybe three times per month four times per month. start deliberate heat
exposure often, still get increases growth hormone, not going
nearly large increases growth hormone

01:04:32 Parameters Heat & Cold Exposure

going experience shock system deliberate heat exposure
every while. important way frame actually context cold.
might say, wait, episode heat heating, not cold,
really can't conversation heat heating without talking cold.
Because, mentioned earlier, cool outside body, shell,
actually heating body. fact, circuits control heating body
control cooling body, instance, activation things like shiver fat loss
response cold shiver, also controlled preoptic area
hypothalamus. can take step back start think take
design optimal protocol deliberate heat exposure looking cold,
mean. beautiful studies showing people get
cold body water, four degrees Celsius 20 seconds. mentioned earlier, will


cause 200 300% increase norepinephrine. Norepinephrine also called
noradrenaline. norepinephrine so-called catacholamines like dopamine
increased dramatically brief cold water exposure. increases
norepinephrine dopamine known long-lasting effects generally lead
improvements mood, focus, alertness. pretty significant. However,
aren't significant enough increase metabolism high degree. Whereas,
studies shown people go outside 16 degree Celsius weather
proper amount, fairly minimum amount clothing, can experience even
greater increases norepinephrine. time required order experience
increases six hours at, instance, 16 degrees Celsius. six
hours day cold, can turn air conditioning
environment make very, cold, fine. basically describing
can sort bookend parameters can use. can use brief
exposure cold heat order stimulate heat shock proteins, growth hormone, et
cetera, can use longer exposure less intense versions heat cold.
really find going work can safely.
confused start, please use parameters described earlier. First
all, check doctor. always, make sure somebody can
deliberate cold heat exposure safely, 80 100 degrees Celsius, meaning
176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit, keep repeating over,
'cause know somebody's going ask, even though repeat over,
fine, delighted keep saying it, respond someone asks again. Well,
parameters going kind bookend terms intensity
heat stimulus. long? Well, heard earlier, five 20 minutes. not start
five ramp 10 15? feeling really bold
really want crank growth hormone, well, 30 minute four
times one day stimulus every while. really figure
using heat exposure for. one reasons people say,
better get wet sauna dry sauna? optimal temperature? better
take hot shower hot bath hot tub? completely honest, depends
going able regularly, whether not want regularly,
specific goals are. purpose episode really arm
underlying mechanisms arm general parameters going
allow access results seeking. worth, personally


use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to
Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli Healthy Men. "Is Difference?"
don't want go details study, pretty extensive
complicated, basically people sauna gave
drug condition low, not dangerously low, low blood sugar.

exercise protocol led increased growth hormone
low blood sugar. Basically mixing matching various stimuli
increase growth hormone. found straightforward.
found sauna waiting period time
later day sauna again, didn't see increase growth hormone
times. First got big increase growth hormone less
sauna again. people exercise sauna, found
exercise stimulate growth hormone, following sauna not allow
get twice much growth hormone. general, anytime release growth
hormone, reduce likelihood going release growth hormone
later day. partially explains earlier study, people
growth hormone promoting protocol day one, day three didn't see
quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week
going beneficial number reasons described earlier. don't
want obsess much exact conditions need order get
greatest effect sauna treatment. just additional tweaks
related food intake low level hypoglycemia exercise, wanted
leverage, could. decreases body temperature tend aid transition
sleep getting hot sauna tends promote decreases body, makes
sense want put

01:16:20 Tool: Hydration & Sauna

sauna exposure deliberate heat exposure second half day,
maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes
water not. going depend much sweat, meaning heat
adapted are. going depend much salt tend excrete
sweat. Huge amount variation, general, one way approach
make sure drink least 16 ounces water every 10 minutes
happen sauna.

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.
system becomes much efficient, people feel elevation baseline
level mood, good happy event comes along, feel heightened
level happiness joy awe improved mood response that. not unlike
effects caffeine dopamine receptor described previously.
aren't familiar it, many drink caffeine love it. Part
reason love release certain neurochemicals, like
norepinephrine, et cetera, energy gives you. Maybe taste, hope,
well, caffeine ingestion also causes increases dopamine receptor concentration
efficacy. words, allows receptors dopamine work better
given amount dopamine release, experience pleasure motivation.


similar mechanism, within endorphin pathway. mean?
means little bit discomfort consequence deliberate heat exposure,
short term, doesn't feel good, definition, activating pathways
allowing feel molecules neural circuitries exist brain body
increase efficiency, placing better position joyful response
events life. confess excited data deliberate heat exposure
improvements chemical systems underlie good mood. just underscore
further, dynorphine system not unique heat-induced stress. fact,
beautiful studies reviews role dynorphine stress
depression, stress alcoholism, just brief aside, future will
whole episode alcohol alcoholism, turns chronic alcohol use
alcoholism causes changes dopamine receptors make difficult people
achieve pleasure things alcohol, even alcohol. kind
really diabolical nature addiction, thing initially brings pleasure,
eventually just required maintain baseline levels dopamine. talked
before, Dr. Anna Lembke, guest podcast, talked
pleasure pain balance exists within dopamine system. beautifully described
book "Dopamine Nation," way. Excellent book recommend people,
addicts not. Well, context pleasure pain clear pleasure
molecule is. actually molecule related motivation, dopamine.
pain molecule, however, appears dynorphine. fact dynorphine
dysregulated stress depression alcoholism relationship
dynorphine dopamine something take seriously.
reason, excited fact deliberate heat exposure can leverage
dynorphine system short term acute way allows mood improve
sauna exposure. So, don't like heat exposure, keep mind
lot observed positive effects biology relate metabolism,
cardiovascular function, also mental health. along lines,
wonderful study, again, published 2018. don't know why. guess 2018 big
year deliberate heat exposure studies. title study "Sauna Bathing "and
Risk Psychotic Disorders." prospective cohort study. Again,
provide link study. really interesting study explored relationship
mental health, people suffering various forms psychoses,
schizophrenia forms psychoses, use sauna. essentially


study looked large number subjects, 2,000 subjects,
no history psychotic disorders. classified three groups based
frequency sauna use, either week, two three times per week,
four seven times per week. call mind earlier study all-risk
mortality cardiovascular event risk. explored hazard ratio
psychosis specifically, meaning likely people develop psychotic
symptoms full blown psychotic illness, according frequency sauna session.
So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association
frequent sauna bathing future risk psychotic disorders
population. Now, not mean going sauna seven times per week
going prevent people becoming schizophrenic, necessarily,
psychotic episode, necessarily. course, frequent sauna use will related
health-promoting activities. study, previous study, went
great lengths order try limit so-called confounding variables. Now,
course, just one study, again, correlative, not causal, based
large number subjects included, plus rigor statistical analysis,
starting see general picture using sorts sauna protocols
described throughout episode, five 20 minutes so, done one seven times per
week associated general improvement cardiovascular health, general
improvement mental health, really points fact that, yes, sauna done
acutely three four times day, 30 minutes session separated cooling,
maybe getting cold bath, sure can potently increase growth hormone, done
regular basis can reduce cortisol, improve heart health, improve mental
health. reason, fact people, conceivable come

encourage continue listen nonetheless, today going talk
specifically heat body cool body glabrous skin surfaces.
briefly, mechanism follows. palms hands, bottoms
feet, upper half face overly specific types vasculature, meaning specific
types veins arteries don't capillaries them,
consequence, heat cold can move quickly palms hands,

AVAs arteriovenous astemoses. Basically veins arteries interacting directly
without capillaries between, allows cooling blood heating blood much
quickly possible applying colder heat elsewhere body,
capillaries intervene veins arteries. AVAs, arteriovenous
anastomoses, can leveraged cool off core body temperature quickly.
key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half

core body, not cold constricts veins just palms
hands, bottoms feet, upper half face. So, not placing ice
packs necessarily, maybe placing cool towels bottoms feet, palms

00:52:30 Deliberate Cold & Heat Exposure & Metabolism

five 20 minutes per session sauna rough guide long
remain sauna. Now, study published just last year
mainly focused deliberate cold exposure. detailed quite extensively
episode cold. beautiful work Susanna Søberg. study looked
deliberate cold exposure, also sauna exposure. study found 57, yes, 57
minutes per week sauna exposure conjunction 11 minutes per week total
deliberate cold exposure threshold getting improvements metabolism
increases brown fat, active fat tissue improves mitochondrial function
thermogenesis, meaning heating body. talk brown fat later.
mention this? Well, interested increasing
metabolism, seem beneficial 11 minutes per week cold
exposure, again, divided across two sessions. not 11 minutes
once, shorter sessions, get 57 minutes minimum per week sauna
exposure, again, temperature ranges talked here. again,
not 57 minutes sauna once. 57 minutes total per week
minimum threshold. might divide three sessions 20 minutes.
again, don't think 57 magic number. 60, 64. probably
55. Remember biological systems not counting things off minute
minute, second second, least not cases.
interested improving metabolism, check episode cold, just take
Søberg Protocol, call it, 11 minutes total per week uncomfortably cold,
safe, cold exposure. uncomfortably cold means really, really want get
shower ice bath whatever environment, can stay in, 11 minutes


total per week divided across couple sessions 57 minutes per week, so,
deliberate heat exposure, again, uncomfortably, uncomfortably hot, excuse me,
safe stay in, probably divided across three sessions. Okay,
talked use sauna decrease cortisol. talked use sauna

00:54:48 Deliberate Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

increase heat shock proteins. talked use sauna increase
FOXO3. Now like talk use sauna increase growth hormone. Growth
hormone hormone naturally secrete pituitary, also resides
near roof mouth. signal pituitary release growth hormone arrives
neurons exist hypothalamus. growth hormone releasing hormones,
believe not, called, stimulate release growth hormone
anterior pituitary gland general circulation, growth hormone impacts
metabolism growth cells tissues body. responsible tissue repair
well. growth spurt everyone experiences puberty
consequence growth hormone. describe study found

emphasize increases growth hormone not sort
observed puberty infants becoming adolescents adolescents growing
teenagers. levels growth hormone associated massive

talking here. yet, us age, go adolescence
teenage years young adulthood, starting early 30s
so, amount growth hormone secrete greatly diminished. Normally
release growth hormone every night, go sleep, particular early
part night sleep comprised mostly slow-wave sleep. age,
less growth hormone released slow wave sleep. various things
can promote release growth hormone, will talk

certain patterns food intake increase growth hormone. that,
want review data, one study particular, discovered certain
forms deliberate heat exposure using sauna can stimulate large increases
growth hormone output, people 30s, 40s, beyond
useful, may also useful people just trying stimulate release
growth hormone order to, instance, recover exercise stimulate fat
loss muscle growth repair particular injury. title paper "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Sauna Bathing." paper published 1986,
years ago, nonetheless serves basis lot studies
followed. let describe study. used 80 degree Celsius
environment, 176 degrees Fahrenheit, subjects sauna
30 minutes, four times per day. two hours total one day, 30 minutes
sauna, period cool rest, 30 minutes sauna again, cool rest, third,
fourth time. So, two hours total 80 degree Celsius environment.
lot, observed really quite significant. subjects
protocol, mention male female subjects study,
entire study lasted week. two hours sauna exposure day one,
day three, day seven week. measured lot different hormones,
cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroid hormone itself, luteinizing hormone,
follicle stimulating hormone, hormones essentially drive production
hormones. won't get deeply, like learn FSH,
follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, please see episode
optimizing testosterone estrogen hubermanlab.com. looked prolactin
looked growth hormone. just cut chase tell effects
growth hormone. subjects two hour day, 80 degree Celsius protocol
experienced 16-fold increases growth hormone. measured growth hormone
sauna sauna growth hormone levels went 16 fold,
obviously enormous, turns statistically significant, effect. Now, one
important caveat here. Remember earlier talked people sauna


week versus two three times week versus four seven times week,
often people sauna, less likely die cardiovascular events
things sort? Well, case, effects sauna exposure growth
hormone actually went often people deliberate heat
exposure. mentioned, two hour day divided 30 minute
sessions protocol day one, day three, day seven week. found
day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared
sauna, effect basically cut two thirds. now instead getting 16-fold
increase, like three four-fold increase, still huge increase,
not great increase observed day one. day seven, tended
two, maybe threefold increase, not great one observed day
one. mean? happen? Well, reason happens
heat, just like cold, shock stressor system. context cold,
get cold ice bath, instance, five-degree ice bath, even 20
seconds, known increase norepinephrine 200%. can double amount
norepinephrine suddenly release brain body, actually can
positive effects. talk little bit,
every day, become cold adapted. circuit compares shelling core
body adjust ways either predict cold stimulus,
likely create thermogenetic mechanisms preparation cold exposure.
why, instance, people use deliberate cold exposure try increase
lipolysis, burning fat, oftentimes will get results while,
lot, lot, stop getting effects. talk lot avoiding cold adaptation,
goal, episode cold, similar mechanisms play here.
imagine subjects got sauna day one, whatever
pathways went measurement temperature shell changes temperature
core led big increases growth hormone, basically way just
describing result already told before. fact result diminished
time either means circuit not efficient communicating shift

think latter explanation far likely. much akin weight

lungs burning heaving breathing hard, first day,
painful thing. every day every day, provided allow
recover, pretty soon running hill not breathing
hard. isn't much burning muscles, et cetera, et cetera. body

exposure going use order try trigger massive increases
growth hormone, going need careful not than,
say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean
discouraging using deliberate heat exposure access growth hormone increases,
specific goal main goal, think reasonable say
don't want deliberate heat exposure, least not sort described here,
week, maybe even every 10 days, want
time events life, maybe hard workouts, trying push
fat loss barrier simply order access growth hormone peak levels,
maybe three times per month four times per month. start deliberate heat
exposure often, still get increases growth hormone, not going
nearly large increases growth hormone

01:04:32 Parameters Heat & Cold Exposure

going experience shock system deliberate heat exposure
every while. important way frame actually context cold.
might say, wait, episode heat heating, not cold,
really can't conversation heat heating without talking cold.
Because, mentioned earlier, cool outside body, shell,
actually heating body. fact, circuits control heating body
control cooling body, instance, activation things like shiver fat loss

design optimal protocol deliberate heat exposure looking cold,
mean. beautiful studies showing people get
cold body water, four degrees Celsius 20 seconds. mentioned earlier, will


cause 200 300% increase norepinephrine. Norepinephrine also called
noradrenaline. norepinephrine so-called catacholamines like dopamine
increased dramatically brief cold water exposure. increases
norepinephrine dopamine known long-lasting effects generally lead
improvements mood, focus, alertness. pretty significant. However,
aren't significant enough increase metabolism high degree. Whereas,
studies shown people go outside 16 degree Celsius weather
proper amount, fairly minimum amount clothing, can experience even
greater increases norepinephrine. time required order experience

cetera, can use longer exposure less intense versions heat cold.
really find going work can safely.
confused start, please use parameters described earlier. First
all, check doctor. always, make sure somebody can

really want crank growth hormone, well, 30 minute four
times one day stimulus every while. really figure
using heat exposure for. one reasons people say,
better get wet sauna dry sauna? optimal temperature? better
take hot shower hot bath hot tub? completely honest, depends
going able regularly, whether not want regularly,
specific goals are. purpose episode really arm
underlying mechanisms arm general parameters going
allow access results seeking. worth, personally


use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to

boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot

heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.

00:52:30 Deliberate Cold & Heat Exposure & Metabolism

five 20 minutes per session sauna rough guide long
remain sauna. Now, study published just last year
mainly focused deliberate cold exposure. detailed quite extensively
episode cold. beautiful work Susanna Søberg. study looked
deliberate cold exposure, also sauna exposure. study found 57, yes, 57
minutes per week sauna exposure conjunction 11 minutes per week total
deliberate cold exposure threshold getting improvements metabolism
increases brown fat, active fat tissue improves mitochondrial function
thermogenesis, meaning heating body. talk brown fat later.
mention this? Well, interested increasing
metabolism, seem beneficial 11 minutes per week cold
exposure, again, divided across two sessions. not 11 minutes
once, shorter sessions, get 57 minutes minimum per week sauna
exposure, again, temperature ranges talked here. again,
not 57 minutes sauna once. 57 minutes total per week
minimum threshold. might divide three sessions 20 minutes.
again, don't think 57 magic number. 60, 64. probably
55. Remember biological systems not counting things off minute
minute, second second, least not cases.
interested improving metabolism, check episode cold, just take
Søberg Protocol, call it, 11 minutes total per week uncomfortably cold,
safe, cold exposure. uncomfortably cold means really, really want get
shower ice bath whatever environment, can stay in, 11 minutes


total per week divided across couple sessions 57 minutes per week, so,
deliberate heat exposure, again, uncomfortably, uncomfortably hot, excuse me,
safe stay in, probably divided across three sessions. Okay,
talked use sauna decrease cortisol. talked use sauna

00:54:48 Deliberate Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

increase heat shock proteins. talked use sauna increase
FOXO3. Now like talk use sauna increase growth hormone. Growth
hormone hormone naturally secrete pituitary, also resides
near roof mouth. signal pituitary release growth hormone arrives
neurons exist hypothalamus. growth hormone releasing hormones,
believe not, called, stimulate release growth hormone
anterior pituitary gland general circulation, growth hormone impacts
metabolism growth cells tissues body. responsible tissue repair
well. growth spurt everyone experiences puberty
consequence growth hormone. describe study found
dramatic, really dramatic say, increases growth hormone, also want
emphasize increases growth hormone not sort
observed puberty infants becoming adolescents adolescents growing
teenagers. levels growth hormone associated massive
transformations, excuse me, body morphology, shape, far greater sorts
talking here. yet, us age, go adolescence
teenage years young adulthood, starting early 30s
so, amount growth hormone secrete greatly diminished. Normally
release growth hormone every night, go sleep, particular early
part night sleep comprised mostly slow-wave sleep. age,
less growth hormone released slow wave sleep. various things
can promote release growth hormone, will talk
things moment, things like low blood sugar, turns out, stimulus growth

real impact extent growth hormone, check episode
fasting. can find hubermanlab.com. Certain forms exercise also
shown stimulate growth hormone release. moments, talk
exercise fasting can combined heat can combined exercise
certain patterns food intake increase growth hormone. that,
want review data, one study particular, discovered certain
forms deliberate heat exposure using sauna can stimulate large increases
growth hormone output, people 30s, 40s, beyond
useful, may also useful people just trying stimulate release
growth hormone order to, instance, recover exercise stimulate fat
loss muscle growth repair particular injury. title paper "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Sauna Bathing." paper published 1986,
years ago, nonetheless serves basis lot studies
followed. let describe study. used 80 degree Celsius
environment, 176 degrees Fahrenheit, subjects sauna
30 minutes, four times per day. two hours total one day, 30 minutes
sauna, period cool rest, 30 minutes sauna again, cool rest, third,
fourth time. So, two hours total 80 degree Celsius environment.
lot, observed really quite significant. subjects
protocol, mention male female subjects study,
entire study lasted week. two hours sauna exposure day one,
day three, day seven week. measured lot different hormones,
cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroid hormone itself, luteinizing hormone,
follicle stimulating hormone, hormones essentially drive production
hormones. won't get deeply, like learn FSH,
follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, please see episode
optimizing testosterone estrogen hubermanlab.com. looked prolactin
looked growth hormone. just cut chase tell effects
growth hormone. subjects two hour day, 80 degree Celsius protocol
experienced 16-fold increases growth hormone. measured growth hormone
sauna sauna growth hormone levels went 16 fold,
obviously enormous, turns statistically significant, effect. Now, one
important caveat here. Remember earlier talked people sauna


week versus two three times week versus four seven times week,
often people sauna, less likely die cardiovascular events
things sort? Well, case, effects sauna exposure growth
hormone actually went often people deliberate heat
exposure. mentioned, two hour day divided 30 minute
sessions protocol day one, day three, day seven week. found
day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared
sauna, effect basically cut two thirds. now instead getting 16-fold
increase, like three four-fold increase, still huge increase,
not great increase observed day one. day seven, tended
two, maybe threefold increase, not great one observed day
one. mean? happen? Well, reason happens
heat, just like cold, shock stressor system. context cold,
get cold ice bath, instance, five-degree ice bath, even 20
seconds, known increase norepinephrine 200%. can double amount
norepinephrine suddenly release brain body, actually can
positive effects. talk little bit,
every day, become cold adapted. circuit compares shelling core
body adjust ways either predict cold stimulus,
likely create thermogenetic mechanisms preparation cold exposure.
why, instance, people use deliberate cold exposure try increase
lipolysis, burning fat, oftentimes will get results while,
lot, lot, stop getting effects. talk lot avoiding cold adaptation,
goal, episode cold, similar mechanisms play here.
imagine subjects got sauna day one, whatever
pathways went measurement temperature shell changes temperature
core led big increases growth hormone, basically way just
describing result already told before. fact result diminished
time either means circuit not efficient communicating shift
temperature shift temperature less impact downstream
effectors not engaged extent wasn't much shock.
think latter explanation far likely. much akin weight
training cardiovascular exercise, run hill fast, instance,


lungs burning heaving breathing hard, first day,
painful thing. every day every day, provided allow
recover, pretty soon running hill not breathing
hard. isn't much burning muscles, et cetera, et cetera. body
adapts. So, one key things understand use deliberate heat
exposure going use order try trigger massive increases
growth hormone, going need careful not than,
say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean
discouraging using deliberate heat exposure access growth hormone increases,
specific goal main goal, think reasonable say
don't want deliberate heat exposure, least not sort described here,
week, maybe even every 10 days, want
time events life, maybe hard workouts, trying push
fat loss barrier simply order access growth hormone peak levels,
maybe three times per month four times per month. start deliberate heat
exposure often, still get increases growth hormone, not going
nearly large increases growth hormone

01:04:32 Parameters Heat & Cold Exposure

going experience shock system deliberate heat exposure
every while. important way frame actually context cold.
might say, wait, episode heat heating, not cold,
really can't conversation heat heating without talking cold.
Because, mentioned earlier, cool outside body, shell,
actually heating body. fact, circuits control heating body
control cooling body, instance, activation things like shiver fat loss
response cold shiver, also controlled preoptic area
hypothalamus. can take step back start think take
design optimal protocol deliberate heat exposure looking cold,
mean. beautiful studies showing people get
cold body water, four degrees Celsius 20 seconds. mentioned earlier, will


cause 200 300% increase norepinephrine. Norepinephrine also called
noradrenaline. norepinephrine so-called catacholamines like dopamine
increased dramatically brief cold water exposure. increases
norepinephrine dopamine known long-lasting effects generally lead
improvements mood, focus, alertness. pretty significant. However,
aren't significant enough increase metabolism high degree. Whereas,
studies shown people go outside 16 degree Celsius weather
proper amount, fairly minimum amount clothing, can experience even
greater increases norepinephrine. time required order experience
increases six hours at, instance, 16 degrees Celsius. six
hours day cold, can turn air conditioning
environment make very, cold, fine. basically describing
can sort bookend parameters can use. can use brief
exposure cold heat order stimulate heat shock proteins, growth hormone, et
cetera, can use longer exposure less intense versions heat cold.
really find going work can safely.
confused start, please use parameters described earlier. First
all, check doctor. always, make sure somebody can
deliberate cold heat exposure safely, 80 100 degrees Celsius, meaning
176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit, keep repeating over,
'cause know somebody's going ask, even though repeat over,
fine, delighted keep saying it, respond someone asks again. Well,
parameters going kind bookend terms intensity
heat stimulus. long? Well, heard earlier, five 20 minutes. not start
five ramp 10 15? feeling really bold
really want crank growth hormone, well, 30 minute four
times one day stimulus every while. really figure
using heat exposure for. one reasons people say,
better get wet sauna dry sauna? optimal temperature? better
take hot shower hot bath hot tub? completely honest, depends
going able regularly, whether not want regularly,
specific goals are. purpose episode really arm
underlying mechanisms arm general parameters going
allow access results seeking. worth, personally


use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to
Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli Healthy Men. "Is Difference?"
don't want go details study, pretty extensive
complicated, basically people sauna gave
drug condition low, not dangerously low, low blood sugar.
condition low blood sugar sauna.
exercise protocol led increased growth hormone
low blood sugar. Basically mixing matching various stimuli
increase growth hormone. found straightforward.
found sauna waiting period time
later day sauna again, didn't see increase growth hormone
times. First got big increase growth hormone less
sauna again. people exercise sauna, found
exercise stimulate growth hormone, following sauna not allow
get twice much growth hormone. general, anytime release growth
hormone, reduce likelihood going release growth hormone
later day. partially explains earlier study, people
growth hormone promoting protocol day one, day three didn't see
quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week
going beneficial number reasons described earlier. don't
want obsess much exact conditions need order get
greatest effect sauna treatment. just additional tweaks
related food intake low level hypoglycemia exercise, wanted
leverage, could. decreases body temperature tend aid transition
sleep getting hot sauna tends promote decreases body, makes
sense want put

01:16:20 Tool: Hydration & Sauna

sauna exposure deliberate heat exposure second half day,
maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes
water not. going depend much sweat, meaning heat
adapted are. going depend much salt tend excrete
sweat. Huge amount variation, general, one way approach
make sure drink least 16 ounces water every 10 minutes
happen sauna.

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.

alcoholism causes changes dopamine receptors make difficult people
achieve pleasure things alcohol, even alcohol. kind
really diabolical nature addiction, thing initially brings pleasure,
eventually just required maintain baseline levels dopamine. talked
before, Dr. Anna Lembke, guest podcast, talked
pleasure pain balance exists within dopamine system. beautifully described
book "Dopamine Nation," way. Excellent book recommend people,
addicts not. Well, context pleasure pain clear pleasure

pain molecule, however, appears dynorphine. fact dynorphine
dysregulated stress depression alcoholism relationship

reason, excited fact deliberate heat exposure can leverage

sauna exposure. So, don't like heat exposure, keep mind
lot observed positive effects biology relate metabolism,
cardiovascular function, also mental health. along lines,
wonderful study, again, published 2018. don't know why. guess 2018 big
year deliberate heat exposure studies. title study "Sauna Bathing "and
Risk Psychotic Disorders." prospective cohort study. Again,
provide link study. really interesting study explored relationship
mental health, people suffering various forms psychoses,
schizophrenia forms psychoses, use sauna. essentially


study looked large number subjects, 2,000 subjects,
no history psychotic disorders. classified three groups based
frequency sauna use, either week, two three times per week,
four seven times per week. call mind earlier study all-risk
mortality cardiovascular event risk. explored hazard ratio
psychosis specifically, meaning likely people develop psychotic
symptoms full blown psychotic illness, according frequency sauna session.
So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association
frequent sauna bathing future risk psychotic disorders
population. Now, not mean going sauna seven times per week
going prevent people becoming schizophrenic, necessarily,
psychotic episode, necessarily. course, frequent sauna use will related
health-promoting activities. study, previous study, went
great lengths order try limit so-called confounding variables. Now,
course, just one study, again, correlative, not causal, based
large number subjects included, plus rigor statistical analysis,
starting see general picture using sorts sauna protocols
described throughout episode, five 20 minutes so, done one seven times per
week associated general improvement cardiovascular health, general
improvement mental health, really points fact that, yes, sauna done
acutely three four times day, 30 minutes session separated cooling,
maybe getting cold bath, sure can potently increase growth hormone, done
regular basis can reduce cortisol, improve heart health, improve mental
health. reason, fact people, conceivable come

01:28:44 Tool: Glabrous Skin Heat Cool

wick improve multiple aspects brain body health. now,
talking whole body heating. instance, putting whole body


sauna, course people do, getting hot tub hot bath

means increase core body temperature metabolism, getting ice bath
cold water sort neck cold shower, et cetera. Now like
talk deliberately heating cooling specific parts body, meaning certain
surface areas body means get effects particular areas, well
whole body level. Numerous times throughout episode, talked
dangers overheating. think someone else
hyperthermic, hot? Well, understand just little bit cooling
heating systems shell core, terrific tools can use
order cool off core quickly. remember core consists nervous
system, spinal cord, viscera, really organs trying
protect. So, able cool off core body quickly can beneficial,
cases, even save life. way quickly heat
cool body, specific elements shell, meaning particular skin

episode guest, Dr. Craig Heller, Biology Department Stanford.
relates so-called glabrous skin surfaces upper half face, palms
hands, bottoms feet. heard
encourage continue listen nonetheless, today going talk
specifically heat body cool body glabrous skin surfaces.
briefly, mechanism follows. palms hands, bottoms
feet, upper half face overly specific types vasculature, meaning specific
types veins arteries don't capillaries them,
consequence, heat cold can move quickly palms hands,
bottoms feet, upper half face, change core body
temperature. name particular vascular structures. called
AVAs arteriovenous astemoses. Basically veins arteries interacting directly
without capillaries between, allows cooling blood heating blood much
quickly possible applying colder heat elsewhere body,
capillaries intervene veins arteries. AVAs, arteriovenous
anastomoses, can leveraged cool off core body temperature quickly.
key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half
face contact cold surface fluid cold enough cool blood


core body, not cold constricts veins just palms
hands, bottoms feet, upper half face. So, not placing ice
packs necessarily, maybe placing cool towels bottoms feet, palms
hands, upper half face, warm up, replacing
cool towels. exact temperature will depend hot happen be.
can't know without knowing particular circumstances. like learn
cool off core quickly, details

Get cool compresses get onto people's face. could, course, also
put cool compress back neck, top head.
especially good idea someone hyperthermic way cooling

years ago, nonetheless serves basis lot studies
followed. let describe study. used 80 degree Celsius
environment, 176 degrees Fahrenheit, subjects sauna
30 minutes, four times per day. two hours total one day, 30 minutes
sauna, period cool rest, 30 minutes sauna again, cool rest, third,
fourth time. So, two hours total 80 degree Celsius environment.
lot, observed really quite significant. subjects
protocol, mention male female subjects study,
entire study lasted week. two hours sauna exposure day one,
day three, day seven week. measured lot different hormones,
cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroid hormone itself, luteinizing hormone,

growth hormone. subjects two hour day, 80 degree Celsius protocol
experienced 16-fold increases growth hormone. measured growth hormone
sauna sauna growth hormone levels went 16 fold,
obviously enormous, turns statistically significant, effect. Now, one
important caveat here. Remember earlier talked people sauna


week versus two three times week versus four seven times week,
often people sauna, less likely die cardiovascular events
things sort? Well, case, effects sauna exposure growth
hormone actually went often people deliberate heat
exposure. mentioned, two hour day divided 30 minute
sessions protocol day one, day three, day seven week. found
day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared
sauna, effect basically cut two thirds. now instead getting 16-fold
increase, like three four-fold increase, still huge increase,
not great increase observed day one. day seven, tended
two, maybe threefold increase, not great one observed day
one. mean? happen? Well, reason happens
heat, just like cold, shock stressor system. context cold,
get cold ice bath, instance, five-degree ice bath, even 20
seconds, known increase norepinephrine 200%. can double amount
norepinephrine suddenly release brain body, actually can
positive effects. talk little bit,
every day, become cold adapted. circuit compares shelling core
body adjust ways either predict cold stimulus,
likely create thermogenetic mechanisms preparation cold exposure.
why, instance, people use deliberate cold exposure try increase
lipolysis, burning fat, oftentimes will get results while,
lot, lot, stop getting effects. talk lot avoiding cold adaptation,
goal, episode cold, similar mechanisms play here.
imagine subjects got sauna day one, whatever

exposure going use order try trigger massive increases
growth hormone, going need careful not than,
say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean
discouraging using deliberate heat exposure access growth hormone increases,
specific goal main goal, think reasonable say
don't want deliberate heat exposure, least not sort described here,
week, maybe even every 10 days, want
time events life, maybe hard workouts, trying push
fat loss barrier simply order access growth hormone peak levels,
maybe three times per month four times per month. start deliberate heat
exposure often, still get increases growth hormone, not going
nearly large increases growth hormone

01:04:32 Parameters Heat & Cold Exposure

going experience shock system deliberate heat exposure
every while. important way frame actually context cold.
might say, wait, episode heat heating, not cold,
really can't conversation heat heating without talking cold.
Because, mentioned earlier, cool outside body, shell,
actually heating body. fact, circuits control heating body
control cooling body, instance, activation things like shiver fat loss
response cold shiver, also controlled preoptic area
hypothalamus. can take step back start think take
design optimal protocol deliberate heat exposure looking cold,
mean. beautiful studies showing people get
cold body water, four degrees Celsius 20 seconds. mentioned earlier, will


cause 200 300% increase norepinephrine. Norepinephrine also called
noradrenaline. norepinephrine so-called catacholamines like dopamine
increased dramatically brief cold water exposure. increases
norepinephrine dopamine known long-lasting effects generally lead
improvements mood, focus, alertness. pretty significant. However,
aren't significant enough increase metabolism high degree. Whereas,
studies shown people go outside 16 degree Celsius weather
proper amount, fairly minimum amount clothing, can experience even
greater increases norepinephrine. time required order experience
increases six hours at, instance, 16 degrees Celsius. six
hours day cold, can turn air conditioning
environment make very, cold, fine. basically describing
can sort bookend parameters can use. can use brief

cetera, can use longer exposure less intense versions heat cold.
really find going work can safely.
confused start, please use parameters described earlier. First
all, check doctor. always, make sure somebody can
deliberate cold heat exposure safely, 80 100 degrees Celsius, meaning
176 degrees Fahrenheit 212 degrees Fahrenheit, keep repeating over,
'cause know somebody's going ask, even though repeat over,
fine, delighted keep saying it, respond someone asks again. Well,
parameters going kind bookend terms intensity
heat stimulus. long? Well, heard earlier, five 20 minutes. not start
five ramp 10 15? feeling really bold
really want crank growth hormone, well, 30 minute four
times one day stimulus every while. really figure
using heat exposure for. one reasons people say,
better get wet sauna dry sauna? optimal temperature? better
take hot shower hot bath hot tub? completely honest, depends
going able regularly, whether not want regularly,
specific goals are. purpose episode really arm
underlying mechanisms arm general parameters going
allow access results seeking. worth, personally


use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to
Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli Healthy Men. "Is Difference?"
don't want go details study, pretty extensive
complicated, basically people sauna gave
drug condition low, not dangerously low, low blood sugar.
condition low blood sugar sauna.
exercise protocol led increased growth hormone
low blood sugar. Basically mixing matching various stimuli
increase growth hormone. found straightforward.
found sauna waiting period time
later day sauna again, didn't see increase growth hormone
times. First got big increase growth hormone less
sauna again. people exercise sauna, found
exercise stimulate growth hormone, following sauna not allow
get twice much growth hormone. general, anytime release growth
hormone, reduce likelihood going release growth hormone
later day. partially explains earlier study, people
growth hormone promoting protocol day one, day three didn't see
quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week
going beneficial number reasons described earlier. don't
want obsess much exact conditions need order get
greatest effect sauna treatment. just additional tweaks
related food intake low level hypoglycemia exercise, wanted
leverage, could. decreases body temperature tend aid transition
sleep getting hot sauna tends promote decreases body, makes
sense want put

01:16:20 Tool: Hydration & Sauna

sauna exposure deliberate heat exposure second half day,
maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes
water not. going depend much sweat, meaning heat
adapted are. going depend much salt tend excrete
sweat. Huge amount variation, general, one way approach
make sure drink least 16 ounces water every 10 minutes
happen sauna.

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.
system becomes much efficient, people feel elevation baseline
level mood, good happy event comes along, feel heightened
level happiness joy awe improved mood response that. not unlike
effects caffeine dopamine receptor described previously.
aren't familiar it, many drink caffeine love it. Part
reason love release certain neurochemicals, like
norepinephrine, et cetera, energy gives you. Maybe taste, hope,
well, caffeine ingestion also causes increases dopamine receptor concentration
efficacy. words, allows receptors dopamine work better
given amount dopamine release, experience pleasure motivation.


similar mechanism, within endorphin pathway. mean?
means little bit discomfort consequence deliberate heat exposure,
short term, doesn't feel good, definition, activating pathways
allowing feel molecules neural circuitries exist brain body
increase efficiency, placing better position joyful response
events life. confess excited data deliberate heat exposure
improvements chemical systems underlie good mood. just underscore
further, dynorphine system not unique heat-induced stress. fact,
beautiful studies reviews role dynorphine stress
depression, stress alcoholism, just brief aside, future will
whole episode alcohol alcoholism, turns chronic alcohol use
alcoholism causes changes dopamine receptors make difficult people
achieve pleasure things alcohol, even alcohol. kind
really diabolical nature addiction, thing initially brings pleasure,
eventually just required maintain baseline levels dopamine. talked
before, Dr. Anna Lembke, guest podcast, talked
pleasure pain balance exists within dopamine system. beautifully described
book "Dopamine Nation," way. Excellent book recommend people,
addicts not. Well, context pleasure pain clear pleasure
molecule is. actually molecule related motivation, dopamine.
pain molecule, however, appears dynorphine. fact dynorphine
dysregulated stress depression alcoholism relationship
dynorphine dopamine something take seriously.
reason, excited fact deliberate heat exposure can leverage
dynorphine system short term acute way allows mood improve
sauna exposure. So, don't like heat exposure, keep mind
lot observed positive effects biology relate metabolism,
cardiovascular function, also mental health. along lines,
wonderful study, again, published 2018. don't know why. guess 2018 big
year deliberate heat exposure studies. title study "Sauna Bathing "and
Risk Psychotic Disorders." prospective cohort study. Again,
provide link study. really interesting study explored relationship
mental health, people suffering various forms psychoses,
schizophrenia forms psychoses, use sauna. essentially


study looked large number subjects, 2,000 subjects,
no history psychotic disorders. classified three groups based
frequency sauna use, either week, two three times per week,
four seven times per week. call mind earlier study all-risk
mortality cardiovascular event risk. explored hazard ratio
psychosis specifically, meaning likely people develop psychotic
symptoms full blown psychotic illness, according frequency sauna session.
So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association

specifically heat body cool body glabrous skin surfaces.
briefly, mechanism follows. palms hands, bottoms

without capillaries between, allows cooling blood heating blood much
quickly possible applying colder heat elsewhere body,
capillaries intervene veins arteries. AVAs, arteriovenous
anastomoses, can leveraged cool off core body temperature quickly.
key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half
face contact cold surface fluid cold enough cool blood


core body, not cold constricts veins just palms
hands, bottoms feet, upper half face. So, not placing ice

useful, may also useful people just trying stimulate release
growth hormone order to, instance, recover exercise stimulate fat
loss muscle growth repair particular injury. title paper "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Sauna Bathing." paper published 1986,
years ago, nonetheless serves basis lot studies
followed. let describe study. used 80 degree Celsius
environment, 176 degrees Fahrenheit, subjects sauna
30 minutes, four times per day. two hours total one day, 30 minutes
sauna, period cool rest, 30 minutes sauna again, cool rest, third,
fourth time. So, two hours total 80 degree Celsius environment.
lot, observed really quite significant. subjects
protocol, mention male female subjects study,
entire study lasted week. two hours sauna exposure day one,
day three, day seven week. measured lot different hormones,
cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroid hormone itself, luteinizing hormone,
follicle stimulating hormone, hormones essentially drive production
hormones. won't get deeply, like learn FSH,
follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, please see episode

looked growth hormone. just cut chase tell effects
growth hormone. subjects two hour day, 80 degree Celsius protocol
experienced 16-fold increases growth hormone. measured growth hormone
sauna sauna growth hormone levels went 16 fold,
obviously enormous, turns statistically significant, effect. Now, one
important caveat here. Remember earlier talked people sauna


week versus two three times week versus four seven times week,
often people sauna, less likely die cardiovascular events
things sort? Well, case, effects sauna exposure growth
hormone actually went often people deliberate heat
exposure. mentioned, two hour day divided 30 minute
sessions protocol day one, day three, day seven week. found
day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared
sauna, effect basically cut two thirds. now instead getting 16-fold
increase, like three four-fold increase, still huge increase,
not great increase observed day one. day seven, tended
two, maybe threefold increase, not great one observed day
one. mean? happen? Well, reason happens
heat, just like cold, shock stressor system. context cold,
get cold ice bath, instance, five-degree ice bath, even 20
seconds, known increase norepinephrine 200%. can double amount
norepinephrine suddenly release brain body, actually can
positive effects. talk little bit,
every day, become cold adapted. circuit compares shelling core
body adjust ways either predict cold stimulus,
likely create thermogenetic mechanisms preparation cold exposure.
why, instance, people use deliberate cold exposure try increase
lipolysis, burning fat, oftentimes will get results while,
lot, lot, stop getting effects. talk lot avoiding cold adaptation,
goal, episode cold, similar mechanisms play here.
imagine subjects got sauna day one, whatever
pathways went measurement temperature shell changes temperature
core led big increases growth hormone, basically way just
describing result already told before. fact result diminished
time either means circuit not efficient communicating shift

think latter explanation far likely. much akin weight

lungs burning heaving breathing hard, first day,
painful thing. every day every day, provided allow
recover, pretty soon running hill not breathing
hard. isn't much burning muscles, et cetera, et cetera. body

exposure going use order try trigger massive increases
growth hormone, going need careful not than,
say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean
discouraging using deliberate heat exposure access growth hormone increases,
specific goal main goal, think reasonable say
don't want deliberate heat exposure, least not sort described here,
week, maybe even every 10 days, want
time events life, maybe hard workouts, trying push
fat loss barrier simply order access growth hormone peak levels,
maybe three times per month four times per month. start deliberate heat
exposure often, still get increases growth hormone, not going
nearly large increases growth hormone

01:04:32 Parameters Heat & Cold Exposure

going experience shock system deliberate heat exposure
every while. important way frame actually context cold.
might say, wait, episode heat heating, not cold,
really can't conversation heat heating without talking cold.
Because, mentioned earlier, cool outside body, shell,
actually heating body. fact, circuits control heating body
control cooling body, instance, activation things like shiver fat loss

cause 200 300% increase norepinephrine. Norepinephrine also called
noradrenaline. norepinephrine so-called catacholamines like dopamine
increased dramatically brief cold water exposure. increases
norepinephrine dopamine known long-lasting effects generally lead
improvements mood, focus, alertness. pretty significant. However,
aren't significant enough increase metabolism high degree. Whereas,
studies shown people go outside 16 degree Celsius weather

all, check doctor. always, make sure somebody can

five ramp 10 15? feeling really bold
really want crank growth hormone, well, 30 minute four
times one day stimulus every while. really figure
using heat exposure for. one reasons people say,
better get wet sauna dry sauna? optimal temperature? better
take hot shower hot bath hot tub? completely honest, depends
going able regularly, whether not want regularly,
specific goals are. purpose episode really arm
underlying mechanisms arm general parameters going
allow access results seeking. worth, personally


use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to
Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli Healthy Men. "Is Difference?"
don't want go details study, pretty extensive
complicated, basically people sauna gave
drug condition low, not dangerously low, low blood sugar.
condition low blood sugar sauna.
exercise protocol led increased growth hormone
low blood sugar. Basically mixing matching various stimuli
increase growth hormone. found straightforward.
found sauna waiting period time
later day sauna again, didn't see increase growth hormone
times. First got big increase growth hormone less
sauna again. people exercise sauna, found
exercise stimulate growth hormone, following sauna not allow
get twice much growth hormone. general, anytime release growth
hormone, reduce likelihood going release growth hormone
later day. partially explains earlier study, people
growth hormone promoting protocol day one, day three didn't see
quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week
going beneficial number reasons described earlier. don't
want obsess much exact conditions need order get
greatest effect sauna treatment. just additional tweaks
related food intake low level hypoglycemia exercise, wanted
leverage, could. decreases body temperature tend aid transition
sleep getting hot sauna tends promote decreases body, makes
sense want put

01:16:20 Tool: Hydration & Sauna

sauna exposure deliberate heat exposure second half day,
maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes
water not. going depend much sweat, meaning heat
adapted are. going depend much salt tend excrete
sweat. Huge amount variation, general, one way approach
make sure drink least 16 ounces water every 10 minutes
happen sauna.

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.

day one, 16-fold increase growth hormone. day three,
however, still significant effect growth hormone compared

norepinephrine suddenly release brain body, actually can

why, instance, people use deliberate cold exposure try increase

growth hormone, going need careful not than,
say, week. Now, extrapolating study. Maybe every 10 days
even better, start getting heat adapted, unlikely
going get massive increases growth hormone. don't mean
discouraging using deliberate heat exposure access growth hormone increases,
specific goal main goal, think reasonable say
don't want deliberate heat exposure, least not sort described here,
week, maybe even every 10 days, want
time events life, maybe hard workouts, trying push

nearly large increases growth hormone

01:04:32 Parameters Heat & Cold Exposure

going experience shock system deliberate heat exposure
every while. important way frame actually context cold.
might say, wait, episode heat heating, not cold,
really can't conversation heat heating without talking cold.
Because, mentioned earlier, cool outside body, shell,
actually heating body. fact, circuits control heating body
control cooling body, instance, activation things like shiver fat loss
response cold shiver, also controlled preoptic area
hypothalamus. can take step back start think take
design optimal protocol deliberate heat exposure looking cold,
mean. beautiful studies showing people get
cold body water, four degrees Celsius 20 seconds. mentioned earlier, will


cause 200 300% increase norepinephrine. Norepinephrine also called
noradrenaline. norepinephrine so-called catacholamines like dopamine
increased dramatically brief cold water exposure. increases
norepinephrine dopamine known long-lasting effects generally lead
improvements mood, focus, alertness. pretty significant. However,
aren't significant enough increase metabolism high degree. Whereas,
studies shown people go outside 16 degree Celsius weather
proper amount, fairly minimum amount clothing, can experience even
greater increases norepinephrine. time required order experience
increases six hours at, instance, 16 degrees Celsius. six
hours day cold, can turn air conditioning

cetera, can use longer exposure less intense versions heat cold.
really find going work can safely.
confused start, please use parameters described earlier. First
all, check doctor. always, make sure somebody can
deliberate cold heat exposure safely, 80 100 degrees Celsius, meaning

five ramp 10 15? feeling really bold
really want crank growth hormone, well, 30 minute four
times one day stimulus every while. really figure
using heat exposure for. one reasons people say,
better get wet sauna dry sauna? optimal temperature? better
take hot shower hot bath hot tub? completely honest, depends
going able regularly, whether not want regularly,
specific goals are. purpose episode really arm
underlying mechanisms arm general parameters going
allow access results seeking. worth, personally


use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to
Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli Healthy Men. "Is Difference?"
don't want go details study, pretty extensive
complicated, basically people sauna gave
drug condition low, not dangerously low, low blood sugar.
condition low blood sugar sauna.
exercise protocol led increased growth hormone
low blood sugar. Basically mixing matching various stimuli
increase growth hormone. found straightforward.
found sauna waiting period time
later day sauna again, didn't see increase growth hormone
times. First got big increase growth hormone less
sauna again. people exercise sauna, found
exercise stimulate growth hormone, following sauna not allow
get twice much growth hormone. general, anytime release growth
hormone, reduce likelihood going release growth hormone
later day. partially explains earlier study, people
growth hormone promoting protocol day one, day three didn't see
quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week
going beneficial number reasons described earlier. don't
want obsess much exact conditions need order get
greatest effect sauna treatment. just additional tweaks
related food intake low level hypoglycemia exercise, wanted
leverage, could. decreases body temperature tend aid transition
sleep getting hot sauna tends promote decreases body, makes
sense want put

01:16:20 Tool: Hydration & Sauna

sauna exposure deliberate heat exposure second half day,
maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes
water not. going depend much sweat, meaning heat
adapted are. going depend much salt tend excrete
sweat. Huge amount variation, general, one way approach
make sure drink least 16 ounces water every 10 minutes
happen sauna.

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine

circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting

brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really

four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal

reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like

response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week

01:16:20 Tool: Hydration & Sauna

sauna exposure deliberate heat exposure second half day,
maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes
water not. going depend much sweat, meaning heat

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.
system becomes much efficient, people feel elevation baseline
level mood, good happy event comes along, feel heightened

key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half

meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't

sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to
Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli Healthy Men. "Is Difference?"
don't want go details study, pretty extensive
complicated, basically people sauna gave

increase growth hormone. found straightforward.
found sauna waiting period time
later day sauna again, didn't see increase growth hormone
times. First got big increase growth hormone less
sauna again. people exercise sauna, found
exercise stimulate growth hormone, following sauna not allow
get twice much growth hormone. general, anytime release growth
hormone, reduce likelihood going release growth hormone
later day. partially explains earlier study, people
growth hormone promoting protocol day one, day three didn't see
quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week
going beneficial number reasons described earlier. don't
want obsess much exact conditions need order get
greatest effect sauna treatment. just additional tweaks
related food intake low level hypoglycemia exercise, wanted
leverage, could. decreases body temperature tend aid transition
sleep getting hot sauna tends promote decreases body, makes
sense want put

01:16:20 Tool: Hydration & Sauna

sauna exposure deliberate heat exposure second half day,
maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes
water not. going depend much sweat, meaning heat
adapted are. going depend much salt tend excrete
sweat. Huge amount variation, general, one way approach
make sure drink least 16 ounces water every 10 minutes
happen sauna.

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.

wick improve multiple aspects brain body health. now,
talking whole body heating. instance, putting whole body


sauna, course people do, getting hot tub hot bath
neck, cases talking deliberate cold exposure
means increase core body temperature metabolism, getting ice bath
cold water sort neck cold shower, et cetera. Now like
talk deliberately heating cooling specific parts body, meaning certain
surface areas body means get effects particular areas, well
whole body level. Numerous times throughout episode, talked
dangers overheating. think someone else
hyperthermic, hot? Well, understand just little bit cooling
heating systems shell core, terrific tools can use
order cool off core quickly. remember core consists nervous
system, spinal cord, viscera, really organs trying

cases, even save life. way quickly heat
cool body, specific elements shell, meaning particular skin

episode guest, Dr. Craig Heller, Biology Department Stanford.
relates so-called glabrous skin surfaces upper half face, palms
hands, bottoms feet. heard
encourage continue listen nonetheless, today going talk
specifically heat body cool body glabrous skin surfaces.
briefly, mechanism follows. palms hands, bottoms
feet, upper half face overly specific types vasculature, meaning specific
types veins arteries don't capillaries them,
consequence, heat cold can move quickly palms hands,
bottoms feet, upper half face, change core body
temperature. name particular vascular structures. called
AVAs arteriovenous astemoses. Basically veins arteries interacting directly
without capillaries between, allows cooling blood heating blood much
quickly possible applying colder heat elsewhere body,
capillaries intervene veins arteries. AVAs, arteriovenous
anastomoses, can leveraged cool off core body temperature quickly.
key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half
face contact cold surface fluid cold enough cool blood


core body, not cold constricts veins just palms
hands, bottoms feet, upper half face. So, not placing ice
packs necessarily, maybe placing cool towels bottoms feet, palms
hands, upper half face, warm up, replacing
cool towels. exact temperature will depend hot happen be.
can't know without knowing particular circumstances. like learn
cool off core quickly, details
technologies developed that, please see episode Craig
Heller episode cold. don't want go episodes, good
procedure use. grab, instance, package frozen broccoli
frozen blueberries. someone really, really warm, make sure take off
shoes socks, get feet top those. Ideally get hands well.
Get cool compresses get onto people's face. could, course, also
put cool compress back neck, top head.
especially good idea someone hyperthermic way cooling

putting cold compresses cold materials onto somebody's torso not going
efficient cooling glabrous skin surfaces, bottoms feet, palms

say, conversely, times desirable heat core body.
again, just simply throwing hot towel somebody not going
efficient way. someone hypothermic, cold, not problem

use protocol, using protocol long time, involves trying,
meaning accomplish weeks, not all, trying get sauna three 20-
minute sessions every week. use dry sauna, not steam room. don't
access it, might take hot bath something sort. general, just stick
sauna three times week.

01:08:26 Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure

generally will either workout, either cardiovascular workout
weight workout, will later evening. later evening? Well,
circadian shifts temperature experience. Talked lot
circadian episodes episodes related sleep. nutshell,
works. Every early morning, two hours typical wake time,
body temperature all-time lowest. call temperature minimum.
Right waking body temperature increases. fact, increase body
temperature part reason wake all, unless, course, setting
alarm. Increases body temperature going one major things wakes
brain body. Body temperature will tend continue increase
morning. get increase cortisol. healthy increase cortisol. Body
tempera will increase afternoon, start drop later
afternoon. general contour can shifted whether not exercise, often
eat, so-called thermogenetic effects food. is, every time
eat slight increase body temperature metabolism, not really
significant throw off general contour rhythm, toward afternoon around
four five o'clock, days, depending time year, body temperature will
peak, will start drop. body temperature drops one three
degrees, referring core body temperature, not shell body
temperature, will start get sleepy transition sleep maintain sleep
throughout night. body temperature will remain low hit
temperature minimum, it'll start come again. means
decide sauna, cold exposure matter, going important.
Why? Well, mentioned earlier, make surface body cold,
least immediate period that, body temperature will increase.
challenged getting sleep still working sleep,


remember sleep foundation mental physical health optimal
performance, try get really quality sleep sufficient duration, least 80%
nights. ongoing goal throughout lifespan huge number
reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to
Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli Healthy Men. "Is Difference?"
don't want go details study, pretty extensive
complicated, basically people sauna gave
drug condition low, not dangerously low, low blood sugar.
condition low blood sugar sauna.
exercise protocol led increased growth hormone
low blood sugar. Basically mixing matching various stimuli
increase growth hormone. found straightforward.
found sauna waiting period time
later day sauna again, didn't see increase growth hormone
times. First got big increase growth hormone less
sauna again. people exercise sauna, found
exercise stimulate growth hormone, following sauna not allow
get twice much growth hormone. general, anytime release growth
hormone, reduce likelihood going release growth hormone
later day. partially explains earlier study, people
growth hormone promoting protocol day one, day three didn't see
quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week
going beneficial number reasons described earlier. don't
want obsess much exact conditions need order get
greatest effect sauna treatment. just additional tweaks
related food intake low level hypoglycemia exercise, wanted
leverage, could. decreases body temperature tend aid transition
sleep getting hot sauna tends promote decreases body, makes
sense want put

01:16:20 Tool: Hydration & Sauna

sauna exposure deliberate heat exposure second half day,
maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes
water not. going depend much sweat, meaning heat
adapted are. going depend much salt tend excrete
sweat. Huge amount variation, general, one way approach
make sure drink least 16 ounces water every 10 minutes
happen sauna.

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.
system becomes much efficient, people feel elevation baseline
level mood, good happy event comes along, feel heightened
level happiness joy awe improved mood response that. not unlike
effects caffeine dopamine receptor described previously.
aren't familiar it, many drink caffeine love it. Part
reason love release certain neurochemicals, like
norepinephrine, et cetera, energy gives you. Maybe taste, hope,
well, caffeine ingestion also causes increases dopamine receptor concentration
efficacy. words, allows receptors dopamine work better
given amount dopamine release, experience pleasure motivation.


similar mechanism, within endorphin pathway. mean?
means little bit discomfort consequence deliberate heat exposure,
short term, doesn't feel good, definition, activating pathways
allowing feel molecules neural circuitries exist brain body
increase efficiency, placing better position joyful response
events life. confess excited data deliberate heat exposure
improvements chemical systems underlie good mood. just underscore
further, dynorphine system not unique heat-induced stress. fact,
beautiful studies reviews role dynorphine stress
depression, stress alcoholism, just brief aside, future will
whole episode alcohol alcoholism, turns chronic alcohol use
alcoholism causes changes dopamine receptors make difficult people
achieve pleasure things alcohol, even alcohol. kind
really diabolical nature addiction, thing initially brings pleasure,
eventually just required maintain baseline levels dopamine. talked
before, Dr. Anna Lembke, guest podcast, talked
pleasure pain balance exists within dopamine system. beautifully described
book "Dopamine Nation," way. Excellent book recommend people,
addicts not. Well, context pleasure pain clear pleasure
molecule is. actually molecule related motivation, dopamine.
pain molecule, however, appears dynorphine. fact dynorphine
dysregulated stress depression alcoholism relationship
dynorphine dopamine something take seriously.
reason, excited fact deliberate heat exposure can leverage
dynorphine system short term acute way allows mood improve
sauna exposure. So, don't like heat exposure, keep mind
lot observed positive effects biology relate metabolism,
cardiovascular function, also mental health. along lines,
wonderful study, again, published 2018. don't know why. guess 2018 big
year deliberate heat exposure studies. title study "Sauna Bathing "and
Risk Psychotic Disorders." prospective cohort study. Again,
provide link study. really interesting study explored relationship
mental health, people suffering various forms psychoses,
schizophrenia forms psychoses, use sauna. essentially


study looked large number subjects, 2,000 subjects,
no history psychotic disorders. classified three groups based
frequency sauna use, either week, two three times per week,
four seven times per week. call mind earlier study all-risk
mortality cardiovascular event risk. explored hazard ratio
psychosis specifically, meaning likely people develop psychotic
symptoms full blown psychotic illness, according frequency sauna session.
So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association
frequent sauna bathing future risk psychotic disorders
population. Now, not mean going sauna seven times per week
going prevent people becoming schizophrenic, necessarily,
psychotic episode, necessarily. course, frequent sauna use will related
health-promoting activities. study, previous study, went
great lengths order try limit so-called confounding variables. Now,
course, just one study, again, correlative, not causal, based
large number subjects included, plus rigor statistical analysis,
starting see general picture using sorts sauna protocols
described throughout episode, five 20 minutes so, done one seven times per
week associated general improvement cardiovascular health, general
improvement mental health, really points fact that, yes, sauna done
acutely three four times day, 30 minutes session separated cooling,
maybe getting cold bath, sure can potently increase growth hormone, done
regular basis can reduce cortisol, improve heart health, improve mental
health. reason, fact people, conceivable come
way get deliberate heat exposure minimum cost.
hot bath, resort bundling going jog, sort thing,

01:28:44 Tool: Glabrous Skin Heat Cool

wick improve multiple aspects brain body health. now,
talking whole body heating. instance, putting whole body


sauna, course people do, getting hot tub hot bath
neck, cases talking deliberate cold exposure
means increase core body temperature metabolism, getting ice bath
cold water sort neck cold shower, et cetera. Now like
talk deliberately heating cooling specific parts body, meaning certain
surface areas body means get effects particular areas, well
whole body level. Numerous times throughout episode, talked
dangers overheating. think someone else
hyperthermic, hot? Well, understand just little bit cooling
heating systems shell core, terrific tools can use
order cool off core quickly. remember core consists nervous
system, spinal cord, viscera, really organs trying
protect. So, able cool off core body quickly can beneficial,
cases, even save life. way quickly heat
cool body, specific elements shell, meaning particular skin
surfaces. talked extensively episode cold. also covered
episode guest, Dr. Craig Heller, Biology Department Stanford.
relates so-called glabrous skin surfaces upper half face, palms
hands, bottoms feet. heard
encourage continue listen nonetheless, today going talk
specifically heat body cool body glabrous skin surfaces.
briefly, mechanism follows. palms hands, bottoms
feet, upper half face overly specific types vasculature, meaning specific
types veins arteries don't capillaries them,
consequence, heat cold can move quickly palms hands,
bottoms feet, upper half face, change core body
temperature. name particular vascular structures. called
AVAs arteriovenous astemoses. Basically veins arteries interacting directly
without capillaries between, allows cooling blood heating blood much
quickly possible applying colder heat elsewhere body,
capillaries intervene veins arteries. AVAs, arteriovenous
anastomoses, can leveraged cool off core body temperature quickly.
key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half
face contact cold surface fluid cold enough cool blood


core body, not cold constricts veins just palms
hands, bottoms feet, upper half face. So, not placing ice
packs necessarily, maybe placing cool towels bottoms feet, palms
hands, upper half face, warm up, replacing
cool towels. exact temperature will depend hot happen be.
can't know without knowing particular circumstances. like learn
cool off core quickly, details
technologies developed that, please see episode Craig
Heller episode cold. don't want go episodes, good
procedure use. grab, instance, package frozen broccoli
frozen blueberries. someone really, really warm, make sure take off
shoes socks, get feet top those. Ideally get hands well.
Get cool compresses get onto people's face. could, course, also
put cool compress back neck, top head.
especially good idea someone hyperthermic way cooling
brain occurs conditions hyperthermia. key point just
putting cold compresses cold materials onto somebody's torso not going
efficient cooling glabrous skin surfaces, bottoms feet, palms
hands, upper half face. Similarly, suppose accurate,
say, conversely, times desirable heat core body.
again, just simply throwing hot towel somebody not going
efficient way. someone hypothermic, cold, not problem
cover blanket. ideally use warm object warm
fluid warm bottoms feet, hands, upper half face.
course not warm burn skin surfaces. actually examined

reasons. Watch master sleep episode like hear reasons
mechanisms make sure that. event, cold exposure late
evening will start increase body temperature again. can make
hard people fall asleep. Now, very, tired,
working hard training hard throughout day, might not throw off sleep
much. gone bouts just so, busy morning till night,
time can get ice bath cold shower late evening
no trouble sleeping that. However, trouble sleeping,
recommend cold exposure early day match natural heating,
natural increase body temperature occurs across 24-hour so-called circadian
rhythm. Similarly, going use deliberate heat exposure, wise
later day. wise later day get
warm environment, sure, surface body, shell, heats up, core
body heats up, also activates cooling mechanisms preoptic area,
get hot environment, sauna otherwise, body will
continue cool down. many people find sauna later half
day, even just sleep take warmish shower afterwards,
find easier fall asleep.

01:12:00 Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone

makes sense body temperature dropping. fact,
goal really promote maximum amount growth hormone release, also
going best time day it, especially haven't eaten two hours
sleep. really going growth hormone release, really trying
optimize sleep, two things actually linked release growth
hormone happens pituitary early nights sleep, well,
wise sauna maybe maybe twice week evening
nighttime, taking warm cool shower just briefly, just enough kind rinse off
sweat sauna, get ready sleep. that, not
necessarily fasted, try keep levels glucose insulin somewhat low


bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to
Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli Healthy Men. "Is Difference?"
don't want go details study, pretty extensive
complicated, basically people sauna gave

found sauna waiting period time
later day sauna again, didn't see increase growth hormone

sauna again. people exercise sauna, found
exercise stimulate growth hormone, following sauna not allow
get twice much growth hormone. general, anytime release growth

later day. partially explains earlier study, people
growth hormone promoting protocol day one, day three didn't see
quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week
going beneficial number reasons described earlier. don't
want obsess much exact conditions need order get
greatest effect sauna treatment. just additional tweaks

maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.
system becomes much efficient, people feel elevation baseline
level mood, good happy event comes along, feel heightened
level happiness joy awe improved mood response that. not unlike
effects caffeine dopamine receptor described previously.
aren't familiar it, many drink caffeine love it. Part
reason love release certain neurochemicals, like
norepinephrine, et cetera, energy gives you. Maybe taste, hope,
well, caffeine ingestion also causes increases dopamine receptor concentration

given amount dopamine release, experience pleasure motivation.


similar mechanism, within endorphin pathway. mean?
means little bit discomfort consequence deliberate heat exposure,
short term, doesn't feel good, definition, activating pathways
allowing feel molecules neural circuitries exist brain body
increase efficiency, placing better position joyful response

further, dynorphine system not unique heat-induced stress. fact,
beautiful studies reviews role dynorphine stress

whole episode alcohol alcoholism, turns chronic alcohol use
alcoholism causes changes dopamine receptors make difficult people
achieve pleasure things alcohol, even alcohol. kind
really diabolical nature addiction, thing initially brings pleasure,
eventually just required maintain baseline levels dopamine. talked
before, Dr. Anna Lembke, guest podcast, talked
pleasure pain balance exists within dopamine system. beautifully described
book "Dopamine Nation," way. Excellent book recommend people,
addicts not. Well, context pleasure pain clear pleasure

pain molecule, however, appears dynorphine. fact dynorphine
dysregulated stress depression alcoholism relationship

reason, excited fact deliberate heat exposure can leverage
dynorphine system short term acute way allows mood improve
sauna exposure. So, don't like heat exposure, keep mind
lot observed positive effects biology relate metabolism,
cardiovascular function, also mental health. along lines,
wonderful study, again, published 2018. don't know why. guess 2018 big
year deliberate heat exposure studies. title study "Sauna Bathing "and
Risk Psychotic Disorders." prospective cohort study. Again,
provide link study. really interesting study explored relationship
mental health, people suffering various forms psychoses,
schizophrenia forms psychoses, use sauna. essentially


study looked large number subjects, 2,000 subjects,
no history psychotic disorders. classified three groups based
frequency sauna use, either week, two three times per week,
four seven times per week. call mind earlier study all-risk
mortality cardiovascular event risk. explored hazard ratio
psychosis specifically, meaning likely people develop psychotic
symptoms full blown psychotic illness, according frequency sauna session.
So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association
frequent sauna bathing future risk psychotic disorders
population. Now, not mean going sauna seven times per week
going prevent people becoming schizophrenic, necessarily,
psychotic episode, necessarily. course, frequent sauna use will related
health-promoting activities. study, previous study, went
great lengths order try limit so-called confounding variables. Now,
course, just one study, again, correlative, not causal, based
large number subjects included, plus rigor statistical analysis,
starting see general picture using sorts sauna protocols

specifically heat body cool body glabrous skin surfaces.
briefly, mechanism follows. palms hands, bottoms

without capillaries between, allows cooling blood heating blood much
quickly possible applying colder heat elsewhere body,
capillaries intervene veins arteries. AVAs, arteriovenous

key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half

bloodstream. reason say elevated blood glucose
insulin tends blunt reduce growth hormone release, true number
different stimuli including exercise including sauna. really nice study
can point to, study published journal Stress.
Literally, name journal. love journals names like
Pain Stress. find somewhat amusing reasons escape me,
nonetheless, amuse me. title study "Growth Hormone Response "to
Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli Healthy Men. "Is Difference?"
don't want go details study, pretty extensive
complicated, basically people sauna gave
drug condition low, not dangerously low, low blood sugar.
condition low blood sugar sauna.
exercise protocol led increased growth hormone
low blood sugar. Basically mixing matching various stimuli
increase growth hormone. found straightforward.
found sauna waiting period time
later day sauna again, didn't see increase growth hormone
times. First got big increase growth hormone less
sauna again. people exercise sauna, found
exercise stimulate growth hormone, following sauna not allow
get twice much growth hormone. general, anytime release growth
hormone, reduce likelihood going release growth hormone
later day. partially explains earlier study, people
growth hormone promoting protocol day one, day three didn't see
quite big effect, day seven didn't see quite big effect. basically
boils really want crank amount growth hormone
response sauna, fasted least not ingested food two
three hours before. don't deep fast, whole notion
breaks fast kind interesting conversation, contextual. Will sip
coffee break fast? Well, maybe probably not. Will one grain sugar break
fast? No. Will entire candy bar break fast? Yes,
blood glucose ingest particular food item. Not much food
item, per say. bottom line want crank amount
growth hormone, wait couple hours eating getting sauna,


maybe dinner prepare dinner... sauna dinner, is,
prepare dinner, eat dinner, make sure wait hours
going sleep. going arrange schedule accordingly. know
people can't arrange schedule perfectly just get growth hormone increases,
think people approach health protocols way. think 90%
people 90% time, just getting sauna twice three times week
going beneficial number reasons described earlier. don't
want obsess much exact conditions need order get

maybe even right sleep. Now, regardless time day sauna
frequently it, going want hydrate going sauna.
go sauna, lose water, lose water, need
replace it. Why? Well, need water cells, also need electrolytes.
make sure replacing water lose sauna. Now no
exact formula much water drink whether not need electrolytes
water not. going depend much sweat, meaning heat

01:17:10 Heat, Endorphins & Dynorphins, Mood

after, after,
after. Now, reasons deliberate heat exposure
nothing cardiovascular effects, nothing growth hormone anything


sort, rather improvements mood mental health. fact,
data related sauna forms deliberate heat exposure improving mood
impressive, mechanistic level terms longterm
consequences people experience. First all, need ask,
deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot
environment. working range exposing range
heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.
system becomes much efficient, people feel elevation baseline
level mood, good happy event comes along, feel heightened
level happiness joy awe improved mood response that. not unlike
effects caffeine dopamine receptor described previously.
aren't familiar it, many drink caffeine love it. Part
reason love release certain neurochemicals, like
norepinephrine, et cetera, energy gives you. Maybe taste, hope,
well, caffeine ingestion also causes increases dopamine receptor concentration
efficacy. words, allows receptors dopamine work better
given amount dopamine release, experience pleasure motivation.


similar mechanism, within endorphin pathway. mean?
means little bit discomfort consequence deliberate heat exposure,
short term, doesn't feel good, definition, activating pathways
allowing feel molecules neural circuitries exist brain body
increase efficiency, placing better position joyful response
events life. confess excited data deliberate heat exposure
improvements chemical systems underlie good mood. just underscore
further, dynorphine system not unique heat-induced stress. fact,
beautiful studies reviews role dynorphine stress
depression, stress alcoholism, just brief aside, future will
whole episode alcohol alcoholism, turns chronic alcohol use
alcoholism causes changes dopamine receptors make difficult people
achieve pleasure things alcohol, even alcohol. kind
really diabolical nature addiction, thing initially brings pleasure,
eventually just required maintain baseline levels dopamine. talked
before, Dr. Anna Lembke, guest podcast, talked
pleasure pain balance exists within dopamine system. beautifully described
book "Dopamine Nation," way. Excellent book recommend people,
addicts not. Well, context pleasure pain clear pleasure
molecule is. actually molecule related motivation, dopamine.
pain molecule, however, appears dynorphine. fact dynorphine
dysregulated stress depression alcoholism relationship
dynorphine dopamine something take seriously.
reason, excited fact deliberate heat exposure can leverage
dynorphine system short term acute way allows mood improve
sauna exposure. So, don't like heat exposure, keep mind
lot observed positive effects biology relate metabolism,
cardiovascular function, also mental health. along lines,
wonderful study, again, published 2018. don't know why. guess 2018 big
year deliberate heat exposure studies. title study "Sauna Bathing "and
Risk Psychotic Disorders." prospective cohort study. Again,
provide link study. really interesting study explored relationship
mental health, people suffering various forms psychoses,
schizophrenia forms psychoses, use sauna. essentially


study looked large number subjects, 2,000 subjects,
no history psychotic disorders. classified three groups based
frequency sauna use, either week, two three times per week,
four seven times per week. call mind earlier study all-risk
mortality cardiovascular event risk. explored hazard ratio
psychosis specifically, meaning likely people develop psychotic
symptoms full blown psychotic illness, according frequency sauna session.
So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association
frequent sauna bathing future risk psychotic disorders
population. Now, not mean going sauna seven times per week
going prevent people becoming schizophrenic, necessarily,
psychotic episode, necessarily. course, frequent sauna use will related
health-promoting activities. study, previous study, went
great lengths order try limit so-called confounding variables. Now,
course, just one study, again, correlative, not causal, based
large number subjects included, plus rigor statistical analysis,
starting see general picture using sorts sauna protocols
described throughout episode, five 20 minutes so, done one seven times per
week associated general improvement cardiovascular health, general
improvement mental health, really points fact that, yes, sauna done
acutely three four times day, 30 minutes session separated cooling,
maybe getting cold bath, sure can potently increase growth hormone, done
regular basis can reduce cortisol, improve heart health, improve mental
health. reason, fact people, conceivable come
way get deliberate heat exposure minimum cost.
hot bath, resort bundling going jog, sort thing,
access it, sauna sort, really talking
stimulus initiate large number different biological cascades

01:28:44 Tool: Glabrous Skin Heat Cool

wick improve multiple aspects brain body health. now,
talking whole body heating. instance, putting whole body


sauna, course people do, getting hot tub hot bath
neck, cases talking deliberate cold exposure
means increase core body temperature metabolism, getting ice bath
cold water sort neck cold shower, et cetera. Now like
talk deliberately heating cooling specific parts body, meaning certain
surface areas body means get effects particular areas, well
whole body level. Numerous times throughout episode, talked
dangers overheating. think someone else
hyperthermic, hot? Well, understand just little bit cooling
heating systems shell core, terrific tools can use
order cool off core quickly. remember core consists nervous
system, spinal cord, viscera, really organs trying
protect. So, able cool off core body quickly can beneficial,
cases, even save life. way quickly heat
cool body, specific elements shell, meaning particular skin
surfaces. talked extensively episode cold. also covered
episode guest, Dr. Craig Heller, Biology Department Stanford.
relates so-called glabrous skin surfaces upper half face, palms
hands, bottoms feet. heard
encourage continue listen nonetheless, today going talk
specifically heat body cool body glabrous skin surfaces.
briefly, mechanism follows. palms hands, bottoms
feet, upper half face overly specific types vasculature, meaning specific
types veins arteries don't capillaries them,
consequence, heat cold can move quickly palms hands,
bottoms feet, upper half face, change core body
temperature. name particular vascular structures. called
AVAs arteriovenous astemoses. Basically veins arteries interacting directly
without capillaries between, allows cooling blood heating blood much
quickly possible applying colder heat elsewhere body,
capillaries intervene veins arteries. AVAs, arteriovenous
anastomoses, can leveraged cool off core body temperature quickly.
key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half
face contact cold surface fluid cold enough cool blood


core body, not cold constricts veins just palms
hands, bottoms feet, upper half face. So, not placing ice
packs necessarily, maybe placing cool towels bottoms feet, palms
hands, upper half face, warm up, replacing
cool towels. exact temperature will depend hot happen be.
can't know without knowing particular circumstances. like learn
cool off core quickly, details
technologies developed that, please see episode Craig
Heller episode cold. don't want go episodes, good
procedure use. grab, instance, package frozen broccoli
frozen blueberries. someone really, really warm, make sure take off
shoes socks, get feet top those. Ideally get hands well.
Get cool compresses get onto people's face. could, course, also
put cool compress back neck, top head.
especially good idea someone hyperthermic way cooling
brain occurs conditions hyperthermia. key point just
putting cold compresses cold materials onto somebody's torso not going
efficient cooling glabrous skin surfaces, bottoms feet, palms
hands, upper half face. Similarly, suppose accurate,
say, conversely, times desirable heat core body.
again, just simply throwing hot towel somebody not going
efficient way. someone hypothermic, cold, not problem
cover blanket. ideally use warm object warm
fluid warm bottoms feet, hands, upper half face.
course not warm burn skin surfaces. actually examined

deliberate heat exposure can improve mood wellbeing? Well, turns
improves mood wellbeing, also improves capacity feel good response
things ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, not situation
going walking around grinning ear ear response nothing all,
simply went sauna. talking regulation
pathways, meaning chemical pathways brain body allow
experience pleasure fullness. whole deliberate heat
exposure, sauna, mood thing works. Many probably heard endorphins.
Endorphins category molecules made naturally brain body
released response different forms stressors. right,
response stressors. So, ever gone long run, point
run, feel like aching joints hurt, maybe shin splints,
push that, part reason experience lack pain
point, usually, experience euphoria exercise exercise-
induced effects endorphin release. rather, specific, say
exercise-induced consequences stress system, turn trigger release
endorphin. words, experience short term acute stress,
endorphin system activated. Now endorphin system not just feeling good,
believe not. also feeling bad. two general categories
endorphins. first ones normally hear about, endorphins, things
bind instance receptors like mu opioid receptor. Opioids not just prescribed
compounds unfortunately drugs abuse, are. opioid crisis
United States elsewhere, serious tragic thing, make
endogenous opioids. make endorphins naturally act pain relievers
make us feel mildly euphoric. also make endorphins dynorphine, D-Y-
N-O-R-P-H-I-N-E, dynorphine, actually make us feel worse response stressors.
get hot sauna, hot environment kind, dynorphins
liberated brain body. mention dynorphins made many
neurons many different areas brain. might think, well, want
that? want release dynorphine brain body? Well, first all,


get uncomfortably hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
sounding terrible. deliberately hot environment using try
trigger sort biological psychological benefit, say, discomfort
feel, desire get environment, part consequence
release dynorphine. also consequence activation sympathetic
nervous system. Remember, preoptic area can communicate amygdala
trigger kind fight flight mode, want get sauna. really, really
hot. dynorphine also liberated certain number neurons. Dynorphine
binds called CAPA receptor. CAPA receptor binds dynorphine
triggers pathways brain body lead agitation, stress, believe
not general sense pain. want get hot sauna,
remember unsafe levels hot, get sauna hot

heat uncomfortable, safe in, dynorphine will liberated
neurons, bind CAPA receptor. downstream consequence that,
will increase receptors bind endorphins, endorphins
make feel soothed, make feel happy, make feel mild euphoria.
there've number studies showing initially deliberate heat exposure,
sauna otherwise, causes release dynorphine. fact, think fair say
every time get hot environment uncomfortable cold environment
uncomfortable, dynorphine likely released binding CAPA receptor.
time binding dynorphine CAPA receptor leads downstream
changes way feel good endorphins, things like endorphin binding
mu opioid receptor, still feel good endorphins, speak.

key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half

knows, maybe that'll work. not many controlled studies yet.
first, least knowledge, studies looking non-burn
conditions. Nonetheless, data mechanistically even interesting
whole business UCP1, why. Local hyperthermia, using protocol
described before, resulted increase promoter, essentially
mechanism certain genes regulate activity. DNA binding
something called HSF1. don't go deep mechanism

just tell fun, can just let numbers letters stream by. not
important. HNRNPA2B1, shortened A2B1, frankly not short begin with,
A2B1, still name meaningless everybody,
really cool. A2B1 directly involved glucose lipid metabolism regulates

systemic, meaning body-wide increases metabolism, two mechanism. One
mechanism increase UCP1, want know, UCP1
causes shifts way potential energy pushed protons
mitochondria, basically mitochondrial function, means ATP,
means cells active, AKA, increased metabolism, increases things like
heat shock factor one A2B1, involved lipid glucose metabolism
regulation. want clear, study not say spot reduction
possible local heating tissue. just can see now paper gets
press, people going say, oh, heating certain patch skin going
burn fat convert fat cell type location. Sorry, not way
works. observe increases beige fat cells certain locations body.
increases beige fat occurred beige fat cells always reside, around
spine, upper neck, clavicles, on. exciting provides yet
another potential mechanism addition deliberate cold exposure increase beige
fat, meaning metabolically active form fat cell. also nicely provides
mechanism, least potential mechanism, observation burn, either small
patch skin burned, again, sadly large patches skin burned, leading
extreme long lasting increases body fat loss metabolism.
What, anything, information? Well, first all, want
much caution people putting anything hot can damage surface

lot observed positive effects biology relate metabolism,
cardiovascular function, also mental health. along lines,
wonderful study, again, published 2018. don't know why. guess 2018 big
year deliberate heat exposure studies. title study "Sauna Bathing "and
Risk Psychotic Disorders." prospective cohort study. Again,
provide link study. really interesting study explored relationship
mental health, people suffering various forms psychoses,
schizophrenia forms psychoses, use sauna. essentially


study looked large number subjects, 2,000 subjects,
no history psychotic disorders. classified three groups based
frequency sauna use, either week, two three times per week,
four seven times per week. call mind earlier study all-risk
mortality cardiovascular event risk. explored hazard ratio
psychosis specifically, meaning likely people develop psychotic
symptoms full blown psychotic illness, according frequency sauna session.
So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association
frequent sauna bathing future risk psychotic disorders
population. Now, not mean going sauna seven times per week
going prevent people becoming schizophrenic, necessarily,
psychotic episode, necessarily. course, frequent sauna use will related
health-promoting activities. study, previous study, went
great lengths order try limit so-called confounding variables. Now,
course, just one study, again, correlative, not causal, based
large number subjects included, plus rigor statistical analysis,
starting see general picture using sorts sauna protocols
described throughout episode, five 20 minutes so, done one seven times per
week associated general improvement cardiovascular health, general
improvement mental health, really points fact that, yes, sauna done
acutely three four times day, 30 minutes session separated cooling,
maybe getting cold bath, sure can potently increase growth hormone, done
regular basis can reduce cortisol, improve heart health, improve mental
health. reason, fact people, conceivable come

01:28:44 Tool: Glabrous Skin Heat Cool

wick improve multiple aspects brain body health. now,
talking whole body heating. instance, putting whole body


sauna, course people do, getting hot tub hot bath

talk deliberately heating cooling specific parts body, meaning certain
surface areas body means get effects particular areas, well
whole body level. Numerous times throughout episode, talked
dangers overheating. think someone else
hyperthermic, hot? Well, understand just little bit cooling
heating systems shell core, terrific tools can use
order cool off core quickly. remember core consists nervous
system, spinal cord, viscera, really organs trying
protect. So, able cool off core body quickly can beneficial,
cases, even save life. way quickly heat
cool body, specific elements shell, meaning particular skin
surfaces. talked extensively episode cold. also covered
episode guest, Dr. Craig Heller, Biology Department Stanford.
relates so-called glabrous skin surfaces upper half face, palms
hands, bottoms feet. heard
encourage continue listen nonetheless, today going talk
specifically heat body cool body glabrous skin surfaces.
briefly, mechanism follows. palms hands, bottoms
feet, upper half face overly specific types vasculature, meaning specific
types veins arteries don't capillaries them,
consequence, heat cold can move quickly palms hands,
bottoms feet, upper half face, change core body
temperature. name particular vascular structures. called
AVAs arteriovenous astemoses. Basically veins arteries interacting directly
without capillaries between, allows cooling blood heating blood much
quickly possible applying colder heat elsewhere body,
capillaries intervene veins arteries. AVAs, arteriovenous
anastomoses, can leveraged cool off core body temperature quickly.
key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half
face contact cold surface fluid cold enough cool blood


core body, not cold constricts veins just palms
hands, bottoms feet, upper half face. So, not placing ice
packs necessarily, maybe placing cool towels bottoms feet, palms
hands, upper half face, warm up, replacing
cool towels. exact temperature will depend hot happen be.
can't know without knowing particular circumstances. like learn
cool off core quickly, details
technologies developed that, please see episode Craig
Heller episode cold. don't want go episodes, good
procedure use. grab, instance, package frozen broccoli
frozen blueberries. someone really, really warm, make sure take off
shoes socks, get feet top those. Ideally get hands well.
Get cool compresses get onto people's face. could, course, also
put cool compress back neck, top head.
especially good idea someone hyperthermic way cooling
brain occurs conditions hyperthermia. key point just
putting cold compresses cold materials onto somebody's torso not going
efficient cooling glabrous skin surfaces, bottoms feet, palms
hands, upper half face. Similarly, suppose accurate,
say, conversely, times desirable heat core body.
again, just simply throwing hot towel somebody not going
efficient way. someone hypothermic, cold, not problem
cover blanket. ideally use warm object warm
fluid warm bottoms feet, hands, upper half face.
course not warm burn skin surfaces. actually examined

lot observed positive effects biology relate metabolism,
cardiovascular function, also mental health. along lines,
wonderful study, again, published 2018. don't know why. guess 2018 big
year deliberate heat exposure studies. title study "Sauna Bathing "and
Risk Psychotic Disorders." prospective cohort study. Again,
provide link study. really interesting study explored relationship
mental health, people suffering various forms psychoses,
schizophrenia forms psychoses, use sauna. essentially


study looked large number subjects, 2,000 subjects,
no history psychotic disorders. classified three groups based
frequency sauna use, either week, two three times per week,
four seven times per week. call mind earlier study all-risk
mortality cardiovascular event risk. explored hazard ratio
psychosis specifically, meaning likely people develop psychotic
symptoms full blown psychotic illness, according frequency sauna session.
So, again, isn't causal, correlative. according data study,
concluded strong inverse independent association
frequent sauna bathing future risk psychotic disorders
population. Now, not mean going sauna seven times per week
going prevent people becoming schizophrenic, necessarily,
psychotic episode, necessarily. course, frequent sauna use will related
health-promoting activities. study, previous study, went
great lengths order try limit so-called confounding variables. Now,
course, just one study, again, correlative, not causal, based
large number subjects included, plus rigor statistical analysis,
starting see general picture using sorts sauna protocols
described throughout episode, five 20 minutes so, done one seven times per
week associated general improvement cardiovascular health, general
improvement mental health, really points fact that, yes, sauna done
acutely three four times day, 30 minutes session separated cooling,
maybe getting cold bath, sure can potently increase growth hormone, done
regular basis can reduce cortisol, improve heart health, improve mental
health. reason, fact people, conceivable come
way get deliberate heat exposure minimum cost.
hot bath, resort bundling going jog, sort thing,

stimulus initiate large number different biological cascades

01:28:44 Tool: Glabrous Skin Heat Cool

wick improve multiple aspects brain body health. now,
talking whole body heating. instance, putting whole body


sauna, course people do, getting hot tub hot bath
neck, cases talking deliberate cold exposure
means increase core body temperature metabolism, getting ice bath
cold water sort neck cold shower, et cetera. Now like
talk deliberately heating cooling specific parts body, meaning certain
surface areas body means get effects particular areas, well
whole body level. Numerous times throughout episode, talked
dangers overheating. think someone else
hyperthermic, hot? Well, understand just little bit cooling
heating systems shell core, terrific tools can use
order cool off core quickly. remember core consists nervous
system, spinal cord, viscera, really organs trying
protect. So, able cool off core body quickly can beneficial,
cases, even save life. way quickly heat
cool body, specific elements shell, meaning particular skin
surfaces. talked extensively episode cold. also covered
episode guest, Dr. Craig Heller, Biology Department Stanford.
relates so-called glabrous skin surfaces upper half face, palms
hands, bottoms feet. heard
encourage continue listen nonetheless, today going talk
specifically heat body cool body glabrous skin surfaces.
briefly, mechanism follows. palms hands, bottoms
feet, upper half face overly specific types vasculature, meaning specific
types veins arteries don't capillaries them,
consequence, heat cold can move quickly palms hands,
bottoms feet, upper half face, change core body
temperature. name particular vascular structures. called
AVAs arteriovenous astemoses. Basically veins arteries interacting directly
without capillaries between, allows cooling blood heating blood much
quickly possible applying colder heat elsewhere body,
capillaries intervene veins arteries. AVAs, arteriovenous
anastomoses, can leveraged cool off core body temperature quickly.
key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half
face contact cold surface fluid cold enough cool blood


core body, not cold constricts veins just palms
hands, bottoms feet, upper half face. So, not placing ice
packs necessarily, maybe placing cool towels bottoms feet, palms
hands, upper half face, warm up, replacing
cool towels. exact temperature will depend hot happen be.
can't know without knowing particular circumstances. like learn
cool off core quickly, details
technologies developed that, please see episode Craig
Heller episode cold. don't want go episodes, good
procedure use. grab, instance, package frozen broccoli
frozen blueberries. someone really, really warm, make sure take off
shoes socks, get feet top those. Ideally get hands well.
Get cool compresses get onto people's face. could, course, also
put cool compress back neck, top head.
especially good idea someone hyperthermic way cooling
brain occurs conditions hyperthermia. key point just
putting cold compresses cold materials onto somebody's torso not going
efficient cooling glabrous skin surfaces, bottoms feet, palms
hands, upper half face. Similarly, suppose accurate,
say, conversely, times desirable heat core body.
again, just simply throwing hot towel somebody not going
efficient way. someone hypothermic, cold, not problem
cover blanket. ideally use warm object warm
fluid warm bottoms feet, hands, upper half face.
course not warm burn skin surfaces. actually examined
studies Heller Lab. Turns that, instance, get people

one reason why, fever ever goes 103, need start getting little bit
worried, 104. times need call ambulance go hospital,
really need employ cooling methods sort talked

sauna, course people do, getting hot tub hot bath
neck, cases talking deliberate cold exposure
means increase core body temperature metabolism, getting ice bath
cold water sort neck cold shower, et cetera. Now like
talk deliberately heating cooling specific parts body, meaning certain
surface areas body means get effects particular areas, well
whole body level. Numerous times throughout episode, talked
dangers overheating. think someone else
hyperthermic, hot? Well, understand just little bit cooling
heating systems shell core, terrific tools can use
order cool off core quickly. remember core consists nervous
system, spinal cord, viscera, really organs trying
protect. So, able cool off core body quickly can beneficial,
cases, even save life. way quickly heat
cool body, specific elements shell, meaning particular skin
surfaces. talked extensively episode cold. also covered
episode guest, Dr. Craig Heller, Biology Department Stanford.
relates so-called glabrous skin surfaces upper half face, palms
hands, bottoms feet. heard
encourage continue listen nonetheless, today going talk
specifically heat body cool body glabrous skin surfaces.
briefly, mechanism follows. palms hands, bottoms
feet, upper half face overly specific types vasculature, meaning specific
types veins arteries don't capillaries them,
consequence, heat cold can move quickly palms hands,
bottoms feet, upper half face, change core body
temperature. name particular vascular structures. called
AVAs arteriovenous astemoses. Basically veins arteries interacting directly
without capillaries between, allows cooling blood heating blood much
quickly possible applying colder heat elsewhere body,
capillaries intervene veins arteries. AVAs, arteriovenous
anastomoses, can leveraged cool off core body temperature quickly.
key thing get palms hands, bottoms feet, upper half
face contact cold surface fluid cold enough cool blood


core body, not cold constricts veins just palms
hands, bottoms feet, upper half face. So, not placing ice
packs necessarily, maybe placing cool towels bottoms feet, palms
hands, upper half face, warm up, replacing
cool towels. exact temperature will depend hot happen be.
can't know without knowing particular circumstances. like learn
cool off core quickly, details
technologies developed that, please see episode Craig
Heller episode cold. don't want go episodes, good
procedure use. grab, instance, package frozen broccoli
frozen blueberries. someone really, really warm, make sure take off
shoes socks, get feet top those. Ideally get hands well.
Get cool compresses get onto people's face. could, course, also
put cool compress back neck, top head.
especially good idea someone hyperthermic way cooling
brain occurs conditions hyperthermia. key point just
putting cold compresses cold materials onto somebody's torso not going
efficient cooling glabrous skin surfaces, bottoms feet, palms
hands, upper half face. Similarly, suppose accurate,
say, conversely, times desirable heat core body.
again, just simply throwing hot towel somebody not going
efficient way. someone hypothermic, cold, not problem
cover blanket. ideally use warm object warm
fluid warm bottoms feet, hands, upper half face.
course not warm burn skin surfaces. actually examined
studies Heller Lab. Turns that, instance, get people
anesthesia, beneficial warm core body temperature. course
fever, know adaptive response. fever uncomfortable,
fact often involves mismatch perception shell
perception core temperature. words, times body
temperature really high, fever, yet shivering cold.
conditions fever, immune system liberates certain molecules
impact, ways, intentionally disrupt preoptic area, POA,
way normally functions can override peripheral signals simply try


heat body kill whatever pathogen infected body.
think fever always bad thing, not. Now, course don't want core
body temperature go high tissues brain body damage.
one reason why, fever ever goes 103, need start getting little bit
worried, 104. times need call ambulance go hospital,
really need employ cooling methods sort talked
prevent hyperthermia. course, safe ranges body temperature vary infants
adults. can look online, depending person's age,
safe range, not. keep mind taking compounds, pills
reduce fever, actually short circuiting protective mechanism burning
pathogen. pathogens, bacteria virus, don't survive
well high temperatures. fact, laboratories, want preserve virus use,
put freezer. want kill virus, heat inoculate it. many ways,
fever natural form

01:35:33 Local Hyperthermia, Converting White Fat Beige Fat, Metabolism

heat inoculation designed kill pathogens various kinds. Now last, certainly not
least, want refer study described beginning episode,
involving called local hyperthermia order trigger number biological
processes fat tissue order convert white fat beige fat,
metabolically active form fat. Many you, least you, familiar
fact deliberate cold exposure can increase brown fat stores,
mitochondrial dense fat stores can, turn, allow person feel comfortable
cold temperatures, water, otherwise, increase core metabolism. talked
episode cold, briefly, general protocol, again, get 11
minutes total per week uncomfortable, yet safe deliberate cold exposure, either
ice bath, cold shower, cold immersion neck, form cold
exposure. triggers increases brown fat. beautifully shown Dr.
Susanna Søberg. increase brown fat turn increases core metabolism
one's ability feel comfortable cool temperatures. study done humans,
now ample evidence animal models support general
phenomenon think people use benefit from. Local hyperthermia
distinctly different phenomenon. involves heating particular surface body


way convert white fat location beige fat, turn leads
systemic increases thermogenesis increases metabolism, believe not,
fat loss. Now, study referring recent study published,
again, terrific apex journal, Cell, Cell Press Journal. again, one three
top journals, Nature, Science, Cell three top journals. Top
competitive, also generally, not always, generally stringent
terms review process. Papers make three journals generally
very, high quality. certainly enough people see not
high quality, get shot pretty quickly short amount time. Whereas
papers journals can sometimes last long time ever replicated, et
cetera. title paper "Local Hyperthermia Therapy Induces Browning White
Fat "and Treats Obesity." study performed mice humans
study. study involved heating local patch skin 41
degrees Celsius, 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit, not damaging skin.
methods heating not involve placing something skin damage
it. fact, study mice, used kind clever molecular chicanery
order it. humans, used thermocouple allow heat
skin just locally particular locations body talk moment.
refer process LHT, local heat therapy. reason
worth considering. long known clinical data. fact, bit
research data people experience burn small, unfortunately
circumstances, significant portion body experience overall decreases body fat
increases metabolism can last many years, Now, course, not reasonable
one ever want induce burn order induce fat loss. observed
increases metabolism fat loss response skin surface burn couldn't
explained reductions activity related burn, instance. fact,
molecular pathways related something called UCP1, uncoupling protein one.
talked also cold episode, don't worry didn't see episode,
choose not to. UCP1 ability increase mitochondrial function ways
increase core body temperature overall, particular, beige brown fat,
fat cells exist generally along spine, particular, upper part
back around neck clavicles. responsible acting
sort candle, say fuel fat candle can burned
manufacture heat body. So, normally think fat think


blubbery fat, thinking white fat, just storage site. Beige fat
brown fat exist just locations, mainly internally, around spinal cord
clavicles, fat stores responsible generating heat body.
metabolically active form fat. Small children lot brown fat
beige fat, particular young children can't shiver. number
probably didn't know that, young children can't shiver, need way
generate heat order make sure stay alive ever get cold.
also probably reason little kids can run around cold day outside
without shirt don't even seem notice, whereas adults freezing
cold. get older, amount beige brown fat tends either reduce shrink
disappear entirely. still debated happens. know white fat can
converted metabolically active form beige fat deliberate cold exposure,
according protocol talked earlier, now seems, based new
study, local heating skin tissue can also induce UCP1 effects UCP1
increasing mitochondria. fact, local hyperthermia, 41 degrees Celsius,
105.8 degrees Fahrenheit, can actually induce conversion white fat beige fat.
Now pretty interesting, can already predict way probably going
go kind wellness biohacking longevity communities. sure pretty
soon going people putting heating pads different fat pads
body, trying reduce, least convert white fat beige fat.
knows, maybe that'll work. not many controlled studies yet.
first, least knowledge, studies looking non-burn
conditions. Nonetheless, data mechanistically even interesting
whole business UCP1, why. Local hyperthermia, using protocol
described before, resulted increase promoter, essentially
mechanism certain genes regulate activity. DNA binding
something called HSF1. don't go deep mechanism
nomenclature, HSF stands heat shock factor one. HSF1 binding
particular location genome allowed different molecule long name.
just tell fun, can just let numbers letters stream by. not
important. HNRNPA2B1, shortened A2B1, frankly not short begin with,
A2B1, still name meaningless everybody,
really cool. A2B1 directly involved glucose lipid metabolism regulates
genes control glucose lipid metabolism. situation


local heating skin converted metabolically sluggish inactive cell type, white fat
cell, metabolically charging, speak, beige fat cell, turn led
systemic, meaning body-wide increases metabolism, two mechanism. One
mechanism increase UCP1, want know, UCP1
causes shifts way potential energy pushed protons
mitochondria, basically mitochondrial function, means ATP,
means cells active, AKA, increased metabolism, increases things like
heat shock factor one A2B1, involved lipid glucose metabolism
regulation. want clear, study not say spot reduction
possible local heating tissue. just can see now paper gets
press, people going say, oh, heating certain patch skin going
burn fat convert fat cell type location. Sorry, not way
works. observe increases beige fat cells certain locations body.
increases beige fat occurred beige fat cells always reside, around
spine, upper neck, clavicles, on. exciting provides yet
another potential mechanism addition deliberate cold exposure increase beige
fat, meaning metabolically active form fat cell. also nicely provides
mechanism, least potential mechanism, observation burn, either small
patch skin burned, again, sadly large patches skin burned, leading
extreme long lasting increases body fat loss metabolism.
What, anything, information? Well, first all, want
much caution people putting anything hot can damage surface
skin onto skin. terrible idea. However, predict time not
far now people will start explore use local skin heating
means increase conversion white beige fat, turn beige fat stores
increase metabolism overall, maybe even improve glucose metabolism
thermogenesis. like detail else study, will provide link
show notes caption. mention study, least portion
study focused humans, involved roughly equal numbers males
females. subjects followed normal daily schedule, including time
composition meals, say, rest active hours, et cetera, et cetera. local

20 minutes. core temperatures skin temperatures monitored
local hyperthermic therapy. subjects exposed local
hyperthermia therapy three days per week, separated day, Monday, Wednesday,
Friday, weekends off, five weeks total, data
collected. study number really interesting features sure
lead increased understanding mechanism new protocols,

01:47:00 Hormesis/Mitohormesis & Heat/Cold Exposure

analysis genes proteins activated downstream local
hyperthermia therapy. find data incredibly interesting, part ways
local hyperthermia therapy mimics deliberate cold exposure therapy.
downstream mechanisms, UCP1, pathways involved,
points somewhat new, certainly important concept. Many
probably heard hormesis, subjecting one's self, others, suppose,
enough stress induce adaptation kind. hormesis reason
get cold water repeatedly, first, painful psychologically, time
get used it. never get completely used it, get used it.
Hormesis also used describe adaptation cardiovascular exercise
hard rep sets resistance training growth muscles strengthening

forth. Hormesis somewhat common term nowadays. haven't heard it, now
heard it. paper describe called mitohormesis, is,
essence, fact number different stressful stimuli, provided activate
UCP1 pathways just described, like HSF1, can induce
changes mitochondria lead increases metabolism. shouldn't
surprise us cold heat can lead increases metabolism conversion
white fat beige fat. shouldn't surprise us pathways stress. Local
hyperthermia stress. Burn certainly stress. Sauna form stress. Deliberate cold
exposure form stress. Exercise form stress. adaptation


stressors not infinite. protocols, protocol matter, going
