00:08:44 Food Shapes: Matter?

audience. Every while, someone will send quite
earnest question something saw internet. one things
heard quite bit last couple weeks talking hormones
food intake interact question certain foods particularly
good certain organs body? can predicted basis shape
foods? first all, want acknowledge question valid one,
see every there. People will say, well, know,
walnuts shape brain therefore good brain or,
know, particular fruit like beet often looks like heart good heart.
certainly invite questions kinds, provided sincere questions. However,
not aware science whatsoever supporting idea shape given
food object matter relevant functional role body reference
biology. Now, beets contain something going talk today. contain
substance called arginine, actually can control dilation blood vessels
arteries. relationship heart heart health. Walnuts contain various
fatty acids maybe, want underscore maybe, beneficial certain aspects
brain health no evidence whatsoever shape food
relevant. And, know, think happened is, people gone
found foods contain certain substances like carrots vitamin walnuts
particular fatty acids beets arginine. selected foods
happen shape thing, organ particular substance like
vitamin fatty acids forth might benefit support. course,
many, many sources nutrients don't come walnuts beets
carrots. guess short way put idea shape
food indication whether not food healthy particular
organ body absolutely unfounded. don't know evidence not
quash anybody's great love foods. enjoy foods just described,
shape things physical universe bears little, any, relevance
nutrients contains therefore organs supports. thank
question see there, don't even think need tell person



00:11:43 Stevia: Naming & Impact

putting information world. just, know, back away
slowly. One thing, move today's material, last episode, talked
problems emulsifiers highly processed foods way can
strip mucosal lining gut. can limit signaling hormones like CCK
can signal brain satiety, signal stop eating. got
discussion artificial sweeteners threw Stevia artificial sweetener.
several people reached correct Stevia not artificial sweetener,
noncaloric sweetener, correct. lumped artificial noncaloric
sweeteners together. thanks many also sent references.
not appear Stevia can negatively impact gut microbiome. seem
unique among noncaloric sweeteners. probably others there.
thing discussed Stevia can lead slight increases blood glucose
can also improve insulin management just slightly, probably cancels zero terms
impact blood glucose, provided not concentrations super, super
sweet. Ingestion anything sweet, whether not contains calories not,
artificial not, will create insulin response. fact, just walking past bakery
smelling delicious baked goods can increase insulin secretion. just want
point out. Thank information references found.
Please send additional ones find them. appreciate allow

00:13:30 Metabolism 101: Brain Furnace

please keep feedback particular things cover
coming way. much interest metabolism. hear high
low metabolism. people like reduce
metabolism. simply can't eat enough maintain weight. people,
however, struggle opposite issue. struggle maintain healthy weight
and/or metabolism low. Now, variety reasons metabolism
can low. Today, going talk two hormones, thyroid hormone
related pathways growth hormone related pathways, arguably


two hormones two systems body significant setting
overall level metabolism. dive those, just want cover little bit
metabolism is. want talk organs body use
energy. metabolism consumption energy, not necessarily eating,
use energy cells body growth tissues, repair tissues, also
just day-to-day maintenance function. good example maintenance function
brain. metabolic needs, so-called basal resting
metabolic needs brain, thinking. just sit bed day
nothing think, consumes 75% metabolic needs. Now,
also moving around. job requires lot heavy labor lifting things
new parent carrying kids around going
stairs back forth refrigerator formula, et cetera, well burning
energy, burning calories. even physically active, unless
ultra marathoner marathoner, chances 75% metabolic
needs coming just brain. neurons consume lot
energy. Neurons, course, just nerve cells brain. two
hormones, thyroid hormone growth hormone, think related metabolism
things body, keeping body fat low, keeping muscles strong, tendons
strong repairing themselves, et cetera, also key brain function,
ability maintain cognitive function throughout lifespan. big theme like
introduce metabolism isn't just losing weight high
metabolism, provided not high, great. means will lean
tissue, bone muscle less adipose tissue, fat. know
healthy. much fat much muscle? Well, varies, numbers
always shifting. general, muscle related tissues burns energy
adipose tissue fat. water body doesn't consume
energy. metabolism can increased simply adding muscle body
reducing fat adjusting ratio two. regardless, even not interested
changing body composition, two hormones, thyroid hormone growth
hormone, super important metabolism kinds, including tissue repair
injury, including maintaining cognitive function well-being ability think
clearly age, offsetting dementia forth. big theme really
includes previous episodes. don't seen episodes
last three episodes today well, talking hormones,


substances released one location body go act
locations body. going tell works thyroid growth
hormone. now heard testosterone estrogen going
hear thyroid growth hormone, want realize repeating
logic.

00:17:33 Releasing Hormones Brain, Stimulating Hormones
Pituitary

First all, neurons brain area called hypothalamus,
just means thalamus, hypo. sits base brain, front,
part forebrain. less roof mouth, maybe
centimeter so, centimeter forward people. neurons
hypothalamus release hormones called releasing hormones.
talked previous episodes about, instance, gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
little neurons signal another brain area called pituitary
release hormones. Today, going see again. brain,
neurons release thyrotropin thyroid-releasing hormone. also growth
hormone-releasing hormone. anytime hear releasing, chances
neurons brain extend little wires call axons
pituitary pituitary releases bunch hormones bloodstream.
pituitary releases things often name stimulating hormone
stimulate organs. keeping theme thyroid hormone,
thyroid-releasing hormone brain, tells pituitary release thyroid-stimulating
hormone thyroid, talk moment, releases thyroid
hormones. testosterone estrogen episode, talked
gonadotropin-releasing hormone, releasing again, brain.
Remember, releasing hormone comes brain. things like
luteinizing hormone follicle-stimulating hormone, pituitary
traveled ovaries testes acted tissues, okay? please
try embed logic. hear word releasing hormone, coming
brain, makes actionable certain ways return later. addition,
pituitary letting go hormones bloodstream stimulating
different tissues. thyroid, thyroid-stimulating hormone. goes


thyroid. thyroid little butterfly-shaped gland right around Adam's
apple. want see yours, not directly 'cause got skin it,
take sip water, look mirror swallow. thing
moves down, thyroid. Now, people call Adam's apple
sits right near protrusion trachea, Adam's apple. No
matter, whether not male, female, regardless chromosomal
background is, everyone Adam's apple. tends pronounced people
got surge testosterone early development testosterone
sensitivity it. actually controls timbre, so-called deepness voice.
thyroid gland sits right got four little bumps behind called
parathyroid gland. releases two hormones blood stimulate different
tissues metabolism. hormones called T4 T3.
already sounding like lot information, really easy, promise. Releasing hormone
comes brain. Stimulating hormone comes pituitary. case,
talking thyroid, binding stimulating hormone saying, oh,
need release something. releases T4 T3. guess what? can
basically forget T4. T4, not completely inactive, roles,

00:21:04 Thyroid Hormone’s Real Effects: Growth, Repair Energy Consumption
Tissues

T3 one less active. Now, thyroid hormone do? lot
people think, oh, thyroid, like metabolism people hyperthyroidal
bulging eyes real thin people hypothyroid overweight
eyes like are, know, half closed something. indeed thyroid hormone
controls lot features face eyes. can control amounts
adipose tissue forth. main role thyroid hormone, T3, promote
metabolism. doesn't just mean consumption energy, means
utilization energy, including buildup tissues. acts sorts target
tissues body. acts muscle, acts liver, acts cartilage, acts
bone. not just involved using energy, also converting energy.
realize said twice. involved taking fats breaking fatty
acids converting ATP, important thing cells use energy.
also involved taking sugars turning energy. yes, goes


adipose tissue fat. different kinds fat talk today goes
white fat liberates helps liberate fats fat cells use
energy. higher thyroid associated leaner bodies. Lower
thyroid associated less lean bodies. one thing absolutely key
actionable,

00:22:45 Iodine, L-Tyrosine & Selenium: Trio Essential Thyroid Function

right already discussing tools iodine. Iodine comes things
ocean, right? couple interesting facts iodine. talk
whether not supplementing iodine not. First all, iodine
common sea salt, kelp seaweed. people can get enough
iodine food eat and/or table salt consume. Almost table salt
world, regardless are, contains iodine. thyroid needs
iodine order produce thyroid hormone. need sufficient levels thyroid
hormone, not much, need it. chances getting enough iodine.
Although, might not, especially following particularly, quote, unquote,
clean diet, might not getting enough iodine. deal iodine. Iodine
combines amino acid talked called L-tyrosine. L-tyrosine
comes meat, nuts. plant-based sources well.
precursor dopamine. thyroid, iodine combines works L-tyrosine
produce T3 T4, thyroid hormone. absolutely need sufficient iodine,
need sufficient L-tyrosine, also need something else, called
selenium. talk selenium moment. condition shows
little pockets world. not super common, meaning not widespread,
certain areas far away ocean, one point, historically
Midwestern states United States, mountain regions countries,
areas Africa far ocean, people get extremely
swollen bulges necks. called goiter. reason
getting swollen bulges thyroid hypertrophying.
growing attempt churn thyroid. getting lot
stimulating hormone pituitary. don't want go far off track
recall, brain pituitary paying attention cellular sense levels
hormones blood. hormones get high, shut off


stimulating hormone, shut signal make more, kind like thermostat.
levels low, like not enough testosterone bloodstream
not enough estrogen, brain will continue push signal make more.
Similarly, not enough thyroid circulating not enough iodine make
thyroid, therefore not enough thyroid hormone circulating, thyroid gland not
getting shut down. tons stimulating hormone releasing hormone coming
brain, like release, release, release, no way can make thyroid
hormone gland just gets bigger bigger bigger. people get
goiter. one reasons table salt iodine it. Although
foods iodine well. much iodine need?

00:26:05 Much Iodine Need? Food, Supplement Ocean Air

Well, don't need whole lot. people hypothyroidal might, want
emphasize might, absolutely talk doctor. serious matter.
Anytime talking hormones manipulating levels thyroid, absolutely
want talk doctor. people benefit supplementing iodine.
contained salts. Himalayan salt, not always, often. know days,
lot excitement pink salts sea salts what, know,
kind artisan salt thing kind taken off foodie land, great.
actually quite tasty. can just take directly like taste salt.
iodine can supplemented things like kelp seaweed kelp tablets.
Now, hyperthyroidal, make much thyroid, actually can
problem. really, best way figure get blood levels tested
thyroid hormone. much iodine ocean believe not people
live near coast can actually just absorb air, just breathing ocean
air. gives sense just little iodine actually need consume
food salt. within miles ocean visit ocean
time time, probably getting plenty. come together,
mentioned, L-tyrosine, foods contain L-tyrosine, provided
sufficient iodine diet, sufficient selenium
diet, serve increase metabolism. growth repair
tissues. really important. not just keeping metabolism high
can leaner side things adjust body weight, excuse me,


body composition ratios way like. Repair injuries, repair brain tissue,
clearance damage neurons, clearance damage body also
going depend thyroid. Again, metabolism kind rate fuel
consumption use body, generally,

00:28:09 Selenium Thyroid: Brazil Nuts & Valuable Sources

not just body mass indexes things sort. talk selenium
really important. even though people getting lot sufficient
iodine, people probably getting enough L-tyrosine. guessing
people may not getting enough selenium goal increase thyroid hormone,
least literature says. Without going biochemistry, selenium
important order thyroid hormone made way allows L-
tyrosine iodine interact. thing people aren't getting enough
selenium don't eat foods high selenium. Now, much
selenium need will depend live. actually varies country country.
countries found say get 100 micrograms, say 200,
say 155. average 155 micrograms, countries looked at. People
trying increase thyroid levels might want consume selenium.
consume vitamin, course, want make sure selenium not
overdoing consuming lot selenium rich foods either. nonetheless, think
fair say people probably well ingesting slightly selenium
currently are. Although, course, always talk doctor. Brazil nuts
heavyweight champion foods get selenium from. high concentrations
selenium. just six eight Brazil nuts contain something like 550 micrograms
selenium. also present fish. certain fish like yellowfin tuna, although nowadays
whenever mention tuna shellfish, rich source selenium, people
will tell immediately sorts issues around farm, not farm, mercury, et
cetera. never particularly liked eating fish 'cause way tastes.
avoid it. like it, sure much skilled
knowing fish buy fish not buy. Ham, things, contains lot
selenium, whatever reason pork does. not big consumer pork. Beef
selenium, interesting look sources, know, pork, beef, turkey,
chicken, cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice, want understand Brazil


nuts, six eight Brazil nuts 550 micrograms selenium. foods
mentioned much greater portion size equivalent six eight Brazil nuts, either
volume calories, something like 30 50 micrograms selenium.
not eating Brazil nuts, guessing people aren't, not eating
lot animal based foods, know many aren't, probably not
getting enough selenium. again, can levels measured can
just check consuming figure whether not meeting ration
need order get healthy levels thyroid. present things like
mushrooms, again, bowl mushrooms, know, equivalent
bowl mushroom 12 micrograms selenium. daily ration something
100 200 range, again, look area are. can see really quickly
even though things like mushrooms spinach milk yogurt lentils
cashews, now vegetarian segment list constructed,
probably not getting enough selenium. kind interesting thing.
experimenter get clearance doctor, try increasing
selenium levels see impacts metabolism. Again, Brazil nuts
probably going direct way get sufficient selenium levels
levels high Brazil nuts, also means overdo well. not
really aware consequences getting much selenium, although
can get much anything guessing consequences aren't good. also
want mention children, daily requirements selenium much lower,
low 30 40 micrograms kids 14 years younger. areas, really
want underscore this, amount selenium recommended daily low
55 micrograms. not shooting thousands even high levels
hundreds micrograms selenium. again, micrograms, not milligrams.
again, look need somebody interested keeping
thyroid function healthy productive, certainly want make sure
getting enough iodine, getting enough selenium getting enough L-
tyrosine. interesting start looking various foods, especially highly
processed foods, start realize

00:33:05 Selenium Pregnancy, Prostate Cancer Risk, Acne

perhaps many people, maybe you, not. Not incidentally, selenium


effects health can quite positive. even though don't relate
thyroid growth hormone function specifically, think might want know
them, given topic selenium. first three studies,
showed high efficacy reducing risk something called
preeclampsia, excuse me, preeclampsia. Preeclampsia seizures related
blood pressure issues around delivery new baby. actually,
rare-ish condition actually can quite deadly. fact selenium
important offsetting preeclampsia risk interesting. don't know exact
mechanism guessing either
pregnant thinking conceiving soon, worth noting. Obviously, anything
related pregnancy lactation, especially talk doctor. guessing
selenium probably lot prenatal formulas one clear benefit
sufficient selenium. reduced prostate cancer risk. study showing
sufficient selenium can reduce prostate cancer risk.
evidence consume foods areas soil low selenium, can
problem. last episode, talked issues related soil quality,
things making way food disrupting hormones forth.
sufficient selenium food offset low content soil.
apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk. minor effect statistically
significant one. one reduction acne, interesting.
guessing probably thyroid hormone pathway
way thyroid hormone can impact liver. turns liver various
biochemical reactions liver can impact acne. probably episode
just additional benefits getting sufficient selenium.

00:35:20 “Clean Eating” Downsides: Cruciferous Vegetables, Leeching Iodine

Okay, already deep tools related making sure sufficient
selenium, iodine, L-tyrosine order make enough thyroid hormones can
support metabolic processes liver, muscles, tendons, whatever
purpose, keeping metabolism high, body composition reasons healing,
keeping brain working well. Earlier mentioned, people following
clean diets. people consume no processed foods. know,
starch might eat going maybe rice grain protein might


consume going either from, hope, humanely raised animal sources
maybe pure plant-based. Believe not, folks actually
susceptible low iodine turns diets meat rich don't
many vegetables, well diets vegetable rich don't many
meats salts risk lowering thyroid hormone way iodine pathway
pathways. let try simplify you. Chances people
all-meat diet, not sprinkling, not wrapping steaks
seaweed may may not supplementing iodine. Chances
probably consuming iodine salt requirements go not consuming
vegetables. People consuming vegetables kind interesting. always
hear cruciferous vegetables important
actually substances, compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables
can interfere thyroid hormone function. eating lot stuff, lot
cabbages just look other, think broccoli cruciferous vegetable,
won't read off whole list, just put internet. always told
eat lot dark, leafy green stuff. Well, unless dark, leafy green stuff kelp
seaweed, chances not getting enough iodine unless adding salt
food. chances may lowering total amount thyroid
making, well fact plant-rich diets, hard get enough L-tyrosine
don't want, know, not inflame vegans carnivore folks.
don't take stance either way that. just learning, trying report
science. point want make health important. purely plant-
based eating lot cruciferous vegetables, make sure getting
enough iodine. seem like cruciferous vegetables can increase need
iodine. thing purely all-meat diet keto,
not ingesting many vegetables. always thought cleaner diet,
better, turns probably true standpoint of, know, hormone
regulation, know, estrogen testosterone hormones. highly
processed foods really terrible. much evidence that. phthalates
plastics processed foods emulsifiers, stuff talked
previous episode, seem people not getting enough iodine
whatever reason, really need check whether not iodine levels need
increased fact consuming many plants many
meats cases, plants actually lower thyroid hormone. not beat


dead horse cabbage,

00:39:00 Benefits Iodine: Reducing Inflammation

number things iodine can positive sort of,
related thyroid, not directly, kind offshoots thyroid pathway
downstream it, say, terms impact metabolic function.
One reduce something called c-reactive protein. may
heard CRP c-reactive protein. C-reactive protein something want
keep modestly low levels. associated inflammation various forms heart
disease even eye disease, macular degeneration. appear iodine
supplementation getting sufficient iodine food, either works, associated
reduced levels c-reactive protein blood anti-inflammatory effect.
anti-inflammatory effect brings us back old friend, interleukin 6. Remember,
inflammatory cytokines. many, many names
many, many them. Interleukin 10 one anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6
one inflammatory. Anytime see IL-6, usually means
inflammatory response, wound, inflammation brain, somebody
either sleep deprived brain injury dealing sort infection.
IL-6 kind catch-all inflammation. appear iodine
supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated inflammation.
sense, iodine can anti-inflammatory effect. now, abundantly
clear. care thyroid hormone, care pathways impacts
like high level metabolism, guess no reason attractive
'cause can eat still maintain healthy body composition, also
brain health, cognitive function, tissue repair, stuff, keeping c-reactive protein low,
keeping IL-6 low, make sure getting enough iodine, selenium L-tyrosine.

00:41:00 & Increased Thyroid Increases Metabolism

curious thyroid actually increases metabolism, allows eat more,
et cetera. relates something covered last issue, glucose. Remember
eat something, blood sugar goes up, insulin secreted pancreas
makes sure blood glucose doesn't go high, can damage tissues


low, can make hypoglycemic. Thyroid increases glucose uptake various
tissues, particular muscle bone. actually can increase bone mineral density,
really good thing. get older, injuries, say older, mean basically
30 older, reason can recover quickly injuries
healthy thyroid healthy thyroid pathways can consume energy.
energy diverted toward bone repair muscle repair cartilage repair.
way increasing ATP. whole idea iodine,
selenium, L-tyrosine, allow thyroid healthy levels thyroid can take
glucose blood divert tissues used, particular brain.
things talking about, supplementing getting food,

00:42:12 Eat Support Brain

can actually improve support brain function. People always asking me,
food eat brain? Like, blueberries good brain?
ask me, walnuts good brain 'cause looks like brain? talked
earlier. fact matter need nutrients support hormones
biological pathways support brain. way think it. realized
people ask, eat support brain? basically
asking short form. keeping thyroid hormone healthy healthy levels is,
going terrific brain 75% metabolism brain.
ability brain use glucose ketones matter going aided
healthy thyroid. things, take things, eat things going
allow

00:43:00 Hyperthyroidism (Too Much) & Hypothyroidism (Too Little)

wondering, healthy levels thyroid hormone? can measured
blood. telltale signs really high thyroid really low thyroid,
start listing off. easy find online well. Things like bulging
eyes, inability maintain weight, shaky, anxiety, kind hyperthyroidal, thinning
hair, kind thing. don't want get diagnosing hypothyroidism
hyperthyroidism. just impossible 'cause kind


shouting back forth tunnel video comments. concerned
excessively high excessively low levels thyroid hormone, absolutely
look symptoms are. Talk physician. number good

sometimes take thyroid gland can administer drugs will either
block receptors will interfere pathways brain pituitary
pituitary thyroid order adjust thyroid hormone way.
big guns terms treatments different thyroid disorders
not talking thyroid disorders, talking get maintain thyroid

00:44:35 Menstruation: Thyroid Carbohydrate & Sugar Craving

diet supplementation. also lot evidence people
menstruate, levels thyroid hormone can fluctuate dramatically across menstrual
cycle. really going process experimentation. don't know
could, could, theory, take blood different phases cycle figure
whether not thyroid hormone excessively high low different phases
cycle. going pretty tough do. endocrinologist
willing you, terrific. think people going figure
supplementing sorts things talked before, getting foods
relates different aspects cycle. general, first half cycle
ovulation, people crave carbohydrates sweets makes total sense
based biology menstrual cycle. Thyroid hormone going go you,
anyone, male female, menstruating not,

00:45:33 Ketogenic Diet & Effects Thyroid, Rebound Weight Gain

increases starchy carbohydrates. interesting ketogenic diets
shown slightly lower thyroid levels. makes sense ketogenic
diets, blood glucose levels low. thyroid hormone secreted large part
proportion much glucose bloodstream much glucose,


excuse me, needs regulated. not trying demonize ketogenic diet.
think definitely place. 22 studies now showing can dramatically
reduce blood glucose. third show thyroid hormone levels
slightly reduced, sometimes significantly, not more, ketogenic diet may
explain, want highlight may explain fact people go back
traditional diet ketogenic diet long time, oftentimes will
gain weight quickly bring carbohydrates back diet. people
cycling ketogenic non-ketogenic every three, four days. So-called
cyclical ketogenic diet. people staying ketogenic long periods time.
people six days on, one day off. huge variation there. point
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates particular, support healthy production
T3 T4. low carbohydrate, going reduction
T3 T4. going bring carbohydrates back diet,
might want gradually. menstruate, craving
carbohydrates early part cycle, actually associated
healthy cycle. healthy cycle ketogenic diet,
interesting. Maybe let know comments point direction
research aware it. can start see, really
beautiful interplay different hormones, insulin glucose,
estrogen thyroid, thyroid blood glucose ketogenic
diet. starts fit together ways make lot sense understand just
kind core elements hormones variety tissues
work on. simple version haven't carbohydrate year,
T3, T4 levels going pretty low. sure ketonistas
there. going say, wait, no, thyroid hormone levels go keto. might
true reasons, indirect reasons related hormone pathways
cascade ketosis long periods time. Great. people
don't consume carbohydrate, T3, T4 going go down. start
consume foods require thyroid metabolism order work with, metabolize,
weight gain can sometimes happen quickly. just something consider.
something work carefully going cyclic ketogenic, long-term
ketogenic. not ketogenic, consuming carbohydrates.
three things talked earlier, selenium, tyrosine iodine, chances
unless underlying condition



00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work
parallel. lumped together episode. increase
metabolism repair growth tissues. conversation growth hormone
incomplete didn't talk kind extremes. certain
people born don't make enough growth hormone, end
short stature. certain people make ton growth hormone
end very, large. tend large appendages.
something called acromegaly. kind like ridging forehead. actually
bone ridge. giant. used called giantism. people course
range height appendage length. doesn't imply growth
hormone disruption there. Growth hormone received lot attention
sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth
hormone. Today, going talk things anyone can increase
growth hormone. reasons certain people want that.
People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,


unquote, levels growth hormone might want

00:53:40 Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know Natural TriggerS



talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth

thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional
conversation. brain telling body hormones make. hormones
influencing tissues body also telling brain

audience. Every while, someone will send quite
earnest question something saw internet. one things
heard quite bit last couple weeks talking hormones
food intake interact question certain foods particularly
good certain organs body? can predicted basis shape
foods? first all, want acknowledge question valid one,
see every there. People will say, well, know,

putting information world. just, know, back away
slowly. One thing, move today's material, last episode, talked
problems emulsifiers highly processed foods way can
strip mucosal lining gut. can limit signaling hormones like CCK
can signal brain satiety, signal stop eating. got
discussion artificial sweeteners threw Stevia artificial sweetener.
several people reached correct Stevia not artificial sweetener,
noncaloric sweetener, correct. lumped artificial noncaloric
sweeteners together. thanks many also sent references.
not appear Stevia can negatively impact gut microbiome. seem
unique among noncaloric sweeteners. probably others there.
thing discussed Stevia can lead slight increases blood glucose
can also improve insulin management just slightly, probably cancels zero terms

00:13:30 Metabolism 101: Brain Furnace

please keep feedback particular things cover
coming way. much interest metabolism. hear high
low metabolism. people like reduce
metabolism. simply can't eat enough maintain weight. people,
however, struggle opposite issue. struggle maintain healthy weight
and/or metabolism low. Now, variety reasons metabolism
can low. Today, going talk two hormones, thyroid hormone
related pathways growth hormone related pathways, arguably


two hormones two systems body significant setting
overall level metabolism. dive those, just want cover little bit
metabolism is. want talk organs body use
energy. metabolism consumption energy, not necessarily eating,
use energy cells body growth tissues, repair tissues, also
just day-to-day maintenance function. good example maintenance function
brain. metabolic needs, so-called basal resting
metabolic needs brain, thinking. just sit bed day
nothing think, consumes 75% metabolic needs. Now,
also moving around. job requires lot heavy labor lifting things
new parent carrying kids around going
stairs back forth refrigerator formula, et cetera, well burning
energy, burning calories. even physically active, unless
ultra marathoner marathoner, chances 75% metabolic

hormones, thyroid hormone growth hormone, think related metabolism
things body, keeping body fat low, keeping muscles strong, tendons
strong repairing themselves, et cetera, also key brain function,
ability maintain cognitive function throughout lifespan. big theme like
introduce metabolism isn't just losing weight high
metabolism, provided not high, great. means will lean

healthy. much fat much muscle? Well, varies, numbers
always shifting. general, muscle related tissues burns energy
adipose tissue fat. water body doesn't consume
energy. metabolism can increased simply adding muscle body
reducing fat adjusting ratio two. regardless, even not interested
changing body composition, two hormones, thyroid hormone growth
hormone, super important metabolism kinds, including tissue repair
injury, including maintaining cognitive function well-being ability think
clearly age, offsetting dementia forth. big theme really
includes previous episodes. don't seen episodes
last three episodes today well, talking hormones,


substances released one location body go act
locations body. going tell works thyroid growth
hormone. now heard testosterone estrogen going
hear thyroid growth hormone, want realize repeating
logic.

00:17:33 Releasing Hormones Brain, Stimulating Hormones
Pituitary

First all, neurons brain area called hypothalamus,
just means thalamus, hypo. sits base brain, front,
part forebrain. less roof mouth, maybe
centimeter so, centimeter forward people. neurons
hypothalamus release hormones called releasing hormones.
talked previous episodes about, instance, gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
little neurons signal another brain area called pituitary
release hormones. Today, going see again. brain,
neurons release thyrotropin thyroid-releasing hormone. also growth
hormone-releasing hormone. anytime hear releasing, chances
neurons brain extend little wires call axons
pituitary pituitary releases bunch hormones bloodstream.
pituitary releases things often name stimulating hormone
stimulate organs. keeping theme thyroid hormone,
thyroid-releasing hormone brain, tells pituitary release thyroid-stimulating
hormone thyroid, talk moment, releases thyroid
hormones. testosterone estrogen episode, talked
gonadotropin-releasing hormone, releasing again, brain.
Remember, releasing hormone comes brain. things like
luteinizing hormone follicle-stimulating hormone, pituitary
traveled ovaries testes acted tissues, okay? please
try embed logic. hear word releasing hormone, coming
brain, makes actionable certain ways return later. addition,
pituitary letting go hormones bloodstream stimulating
different tissues. thyroid, thyroid-stimulating hormone. goes


thyroid. thyroid little butterfly-shaped gland right around Adam's
apple. want see yours, not directly 'cause got skin it,
take sip water, look mirror swallow. thing
moves down, thyroid. Now, people call Adam's apple
sits right near protrusion trachea, Adam's apple. No
matter, whether not male, female, regardless chromosomal
background is, everyone Adam's apple. tends pronounced people
got surge testosterone early development testosterone
sensitivity it. actually controls timbre, so-called deepness voice.
thyroid gland sits right got four little bumps behind called
parathyroid gland. releases two hormones blood stimulate different
tissues metabolism. hormones called T4 T3.
already sounding like lot information, really easy, promise. Releasing hormone
comes brain. Stimulating hormone comes pituitary. case,
talking thyroid, binding stimulating hormone saying, oh,
need release something. releases T4 T3. guess what? can
basically forget T4. T4, not completely inactive, roles,

00:21:04 Thyroid Hormone’s Real Effects: Growth, Repair Energy Consumption

00:22:45 Iodine, L-Tyrosine & Selenium: Trio Essential Thyroid Function

right already discussing tools iodine. Iodine comes things
ocean, right? couple interesting facts iodine. talk
whether not supplementing iodine not. First all, iodine
common sea salt, kelp seaweed. people can get enough
iodine food eat and/or table salt consume. Almost table salt
world, regardless are, contains iodine. thyroid needs
iodine order produce thyroid hormone. need sufficient levels thyroid
hormone, not much, need it. chances getting enough iodine.
Although, might not, especially following particularly, quote, unquote,
clean diet, might not getting enough iodine. deal iodine. Iodine
combines amino acid talked called L-tyrosine. L-tyrosine
comes meat, nuts. plant-based sources well.
precursor dopamine. thyroid, iodine combines works L-tyrosine
produce T3 T4, thyroid hormone. absolutely need sufficient iodine,
need sufficient L-tyrosine, also need something else, called
selenium. talk selenium moment. condition shows
little pockets world. not super common, meaning not widespread,
certain areas far away ocean, one point, historically
Midwestern states United States, mountain regions countries,
areas Africa far ocean, people get extremely
swollen bulges necks. called goiter. reason
getting swollen bulges thyroid hypertrophying.
growing attempt churn thyroid. getting lot
stimulating hormone pituitary. don't want go far off track
recall, brain pituitary paying attention cellular sense levels
hormones blood. hormones get high, shut off


stimulating hormone, shut signal make more, kind like thermostat.
levels low, like not enough testosterone bloodstream
not enough estrogen, brain will continue push signal make more.
Similarly, not enough thyroid circulating not enough iodine make
thyroid, therefore not enough thyroid hormone circulating, thyroid gland not
getting shut down. tons stimulating hormone releasing hormone coming
brain, like release, release, release, no way can make thyroid
hormone gland just gets bigger bigger bigger. people get
goiter. one reasons table salt iodine it. Although
foods iodine well. much iodine need?

00:26:05 Much Iodine Need? Food, Supplement Ocean Air

Well, don't need whole lot. people hypothyroidal might, want
emphasize might, absolutely talk doctor. serious matter.
Anytime talking hormones manipulating levels thyroid, absolutely
want talk doctor. people benefit supplementing iodine.
contained salts. Himalayan salt, not always, often. know days,
lot excitement pink salts sea salts what, know,
kind artisan salt thing kind taken off foodie land, great.
actually quite tasty. can just take directly like taste salt.
iodine can supplemented things like kelp seaweed kelp tablets.
Now, hyperthyroidal, make much thyroid, actually can
problem. really, best way figure get blood levels tested
thyroid hormone. much iodine ocean believe not people
live near coast can actually just absorb air, just breathing ocean
air. gives sense just little iodine actually need consume
food salt. within miles ocean visit ocean
time time, probably getting plenty. come together,
mentioned, L-tyrosine, foods contain L-tyrosine, provided
sufficient iodine diet, sufficient selenium
diet, serve increase metabolism. growth repair
tissues. really important. not just keeping metabolism high
can leaner side things adjust body weight, excuse me,


body composition ratios way like. Repair injuries, repair brain tissue,
clearance damage neurons, clearance damage body also
going depend thyroid. Again, metabolism kind rate fuel
consumption use body, generally,

00:28:09 Selenium Thyroid: Brazil Nuts & Valuable Sources

not just body mass indexes things sort. talk selenium
really important. even though people getting lot sufficient
iodine, people probably getting enough L-tyrosine. guessing
people may not getting enough selenium goal increase thyroid hormone,
least literature says. Without going biochemistry, selenium
important order thyroid hormone made way allows L-
tyrosine iodine interact. thing people aren't getting enough
selenium don't eat foods high selenium. Now, much
selenium need will depend live. actually varies country country.
countries found say get 100 micrograms, say 200,
say 155. average 155 micrograms, countries looked at. People
trying increase thyroid levels might want consume selenium.
consume vitamin, course, want make sure selenium not
overdoing consuming lot selenium rich foods either. nonetheless, think
fair say people probably well ingesting slightly selenium
currently are. Although, course, always talk doctor. Brazil nuts
heavyweight champion foods get selenium from. high concentrations
selenium. just six eight Brazil nuts contain something like 550 micrograms
selenium. also present fish. certain fish like yellowfin tuna, although nowadays
whenever mention tuna shellfish, rich source selenium, people
will tell immediately sorts issues around farm, not farm, mercury, et
cetera. never particularly liked eating fish 'cause way tastes.
avoid it. like it, sure much skilled
knowing fish buy fish not buy. Ham, things, contains lot
selenium, whatever reason pork does. not big consumer pork. Beef
selenium, interesting look sources, know, pork, beef, turkey,
chicken, cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice, want understand Brazil


nuts, six eight Brazil nuts 550 micrograms selenium. foods
mentioned much greater portion size equivalent six eight Brazil nuts, either
volume calories, something like 30 50 micrograms selenium.
not eating Brazil nuts, guessing people aren't, not eating
lot animal based foods, know many aren't, probably not
getting enough selenium. again, can levels measured can
just check consuming figure whether not meeting ration
need order get healthy levels thyroid. present things like
mushrooms, again, bowl mushrooms, know, equivalent
bowl mushroom 12 micrograms selenium. daily ration something
100 200 range, again, look area are. can see really quickly
even though things like mushrooms spinach milk yogurt lentils
cashews, now vegetarian segment list constructed,
probably not getting enough selenium. kind interesting thing.
experimenter get clearance doctor, try increasing
selenium levels see impacts metabolism. Again, Brazil nuts
probably going direct way get sufficient selenium levels
levels high Brazil nuts, also means overdo well. not
really aware consequences getting much selenium, although
can get much anything guessing consequences aren't good. also
want mention children, daily requirements selenium much lower,
low 30 40 micrograms kids 14 years younger. areas, really
want underscore this, amount selenium recommended daily low
55 micrograms. not shooting thousands even high levels
hundreds micrograms selenium. again, micrograms, not milligrams.
again, look need somebody interested keeping
thyroid function healthy productive, certainly want make sure
getting enough iodine, getting enough selenium getting enough L-
tyrosine. interesting start looking various foods, especially highly
processed foods, start realize

00:33:05 Selenium Pregnancy, Prostate Cancer Risk, Acne

perhaps many people, maybe you, not. Not incidentally, selenium


effects health can quite positive. even though don't relate
thyroid growth hormone function specifically, think might want know
them, given topic selenium. first three studies,
showed high efficacy reducing risk something called
preeclampsia, excuse me, preeclampsia. Preeclampsia seizures related
blood pressure issues around delivery new baby. actually,
rare-ish condition actually can quite deadly. fact selenium
important offsetting preeclampsia risk interesting. don't know exact
mechanism guessing either
pregnant thinking conceiving soon, worth noting. Obviously, anything
related pregnancy lactation, especially talk doctor. guessing
selenium probably lot prenatal formulas one clear benefit
sufficient selenium. reduced prostate cancer risk. study showing
sufficient selenium can reduce prostate cancer risk.
evidence consume foods areas soil low selenium, can
problem. last episode, talked issues related soil quality,
things making way food disrupting hormones forth.
sufficient selenium food offset low content soil.
apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk. minor effect statistically
significant one. one reduction acne, interesting.
guessing probably thyroid hormone pathway
way thyroid hormone can impact liver. turns liver various
biochemical reactions liver can impact acne. probably episode
just additional benefits getting sufficient selenium.

00:35:20 “Clean Eating” Downsides: Cruciferous Vegetables, Leeching Iodine

Okay, already deep tools related making sure sufficient
selenium, iodine, L-tyrosine order make enough thyroid hormones can
support metabolic processes liver, muscles, tendons, whatever
purpose, keeping metabolism high, body composition reasons healing,
keeping brain working well. Earlier mentioned, people following
clean diets. people consume no processed foods. know,
starch might eat going maybe rice grain protein might


consume going either from, hope, humanely raised animal sources
maybe pure plant-based. Believe not, folks actually
susceptible low iodine turns diets meat rich don't
many vegetables, well diets vegetable rich don't many
meats salts risk lowering thyroid hormone way iodine pathway
pathways. let try simplify you. Chances people
all-meat diet, not sprinkling, not wrapping steaks
seaweed may may not supplementing iodine. Chances
probably consuming iodine salt requirements go not consuming
vegetables. People consuming vegetables kind interesting. always
hear cruciferous vegetables important
actually substances, compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables
can interfere thyroid hormone function. eating lot stuff, lot
cabbages just look other, think broccoli cruciferous vegetable,
won't read off whole list, just put internet. always told
eat lot dark, leafy green stuff. Well, unless dark, leafy green stuff kelp
seaweed, chances not getting enough iodine unless adding salt
food. chances may lowering total amount thyroid
making, well fact plant-rich diets, hard get enough L-tyrosine
don't want, know, not inflame vegans carnivore folks.
don't take stance either way that. just learning, trying report
science. point want make health important. purely plant-
based eating lot cruciferous vegetables, make sure getting
enough iodine. seem like cruciferous vegetables can increase need
iodine. thing purely all-meat diet keto,
not ingesting many vegetables. always thought cleaner diet,
better, turns probably true standpoint of, know, hormone
regulation, know, estrogen testosterone hormones. highly
processed foods really terrible. much evidence that. phthalates
plastics processed foods emulsifiers, stuff talked
previous episode, seem people not getting enough iodine
whatever reason, really need check whether not iodine levels need
increased fact consuming many plants many
meats cases, plants actually lower thyroid hormone. not beat


dead horse cabbage,

00:39:00 Benefits Iodine: Reducing Inflammation

number things iodine can positive sort of,
related thyroid, not directly, kind offshoots thyroid pathway
downstream it, say, terms impact metabolic function.
One reduce something called c-reactive protein. may
heard CRP c-reactive protein. C-reactive protein something want
keep modestly low levels. associated inflammation various forms heart
disease even eye disease, macular degeneration. appear iodine
supplementation getting sufficient iodine food, either works, associated
reduced levels c-reactive protein blood anti-inflammatory effect.
anti-inflammatory effect brings us back old friend, interleukin 6. Remember,
inflammatory cytokines. many, many names
many, many them. Interleukin 10 one anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6
one inflammatory. Anytime see IL-6, usually means
inflammatory response, wound, inflammation brain, somebody
either sleep deprived brain injury dealing sort infection.
IL-6 kind catch-all inflammation. appear iodine
supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated inflammation.
sense, iodine can anti-inflammatory effect. now, abundantly
clear. care thyroid hormone, care pathways impacts
like high level metabolism, guess no reason attractive
'cause can eat still maintain healthy body composition, also
brain health, cognitive function, tissue repair, stuff, keeping c-reactive protein low,
keeping IL-6 low, make sure getting enough iodine, selenium L-tyrosine.

00:41:00 & Increased Thyroid Increases Metabolism

curious thyroid actually increases metabolism, allows eat more,
et cetera. relates something covered last issue, glucose. Remember
eat something, blood sugar goes up, insulin secreted pancreas
makes sure blood glucose doesn't go high, can damage tissues


low, can make hypoglycemic. Thyroid increases glucose uptake various
tissues, particular muscle bone. actually can increase bone mineral density,
really good thing. get older, injuries, say older, mean basically
30 older, reason can recover quickly injuries
healthy thyroid healthy thyroid pathways can consume energy.
energy diverted toward bone repair muscle repair cartilage repair.
way increasing ATP. whole idea iodine,
selenium, L-tyrosine, allow thyroid healthy levels thyroid can take
glucose blood divert tissues used, particular brain.
things talking about, supplementing getting food,

00:42:12 Eat Support Brain

can actually improve support brain function. People always asking me,
food eat brain? Like, blueberries good brain?
ask me, walnuts good brain 'cause looks like brain? talked

excuse me, needs regulated. not trying demonize ketogenic diet.
think definitely place. 22 studies now showing can dramatically

00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released

sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth

People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,

00:53:40 Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know Natural TriggerS



talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth

healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly

can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered

studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional
conversation. brain telling body hormones make. hormones
influencing tissues body also telling brain

00:08:44 Food Shapes: Matter?

audience. Every while, someone will send quite
earnest question something saw internet. one things
heard quite bit last couple weeks talking hormones
food intake interact question certain foods particularly
good certain organs body? can predicted basis shape
foods? first all, want acknowledge question valid one,
see every there. People will say, well, know,
walnuts shape brain therefore good brain or,
know, particular fruit like beet often looks like heart good heart.
certainly invite questions kinds, provided sincere questions. However,
not aware science whatsoever supporting idea shape given
food object matter relevant functional role body reference
biology. Now, beets contain something going talk today. contain
substance called arginine, actually can control dilation blood vessels
arteries. relationship heart heart health. Walnuts contain various
fatty acids maybe, want underscore maybe, beneficial certain aspects
brain health no evidence whatsoever shape food
relevant. And, know, think happened is, people gone
found foods contain certain substances like carrots vitamin walnuts
particular fatty acids beets arginine. selected foods
happen shape thing, organ particular substance like
vitamin fatty acids forth might benefit support. course,
many, many sources nutrients don't come walnuts beets
carrots. guess short way put idea shape
food indication whether not food healthy particular
organ body absolutely unfounded. don't know evidence not
quash anybody's great love foods. enjoy foods just described,
shape things physical universe bears little, any, relevance
nutrients contains therefore organs supports. thank
question see there, don't even think need tell person



00:11:43 Stevia: Naming & Impact

putting information world. just, know, back away
slowly. One thing, move today's material, last episode, talked
problems emulsifiers highly processed foods way can
strip mucosal lining gut. can limit signaling hormones like CCK
can signal brain satiety, signal stop eating. got
discussion artificial sweeteners threw Stevia artificial sweetener.
several people reached correct Stevia not artificial sweetener,
noncaloric sweetener, correct. lumped artificial noncaloric
sweeteners together. thanks many also sent references.
not appear Stevia can negatively impact gut microbiome. seem
unique among noncaloric sweeteners. probably others there.
thing discussed Stevia can lead slight increases blood glucose
can also improve insulin management just slightly, probably cancels zero terms
impact blood glucose, provided not concentrations super, super
sweet. Ingestion anything sweet, whether not contains calories not,
artificial not, will create insulin response. fact, just walking past bakery
smelling delicious baked goods can increase insulin secretion. just want
point out. Thank information references found.
Please send additional ones find them. appreciate allow

00:13:30 Metabolism 101: Brain Furnace

please keep feedback particular things cover
coming way. much interest metabolism. hear high
low metabolism. people like reduce
metabolism. simply can't eat enough maintain weight. people,
however, struggle opposite issue. struggle maintain healthy weight
and/or metabolism low. Now, variety reasons metabolism
can low. Today, going talk two hormones, thyroid hormone
related pathways growth hormone related pathways, arguably


two hormones two systems body significant setting
overall level metabolism. dive those, just want cover little bit
metabolism is. want talk organs body use
energy. metabolism consumption energy, not necessarily eating,
use energy cells body growth tissues, repair tissues, also
just day-to-day maintenance function. good example maintenance function
brain. metabolic needs, so-called basal resting
metabolic needs brain, thinking. just sit bed day
nothing think, consumes 75% metabolic needs. Now,
also moving around. job requires lot heavy labor lifting things
new parent carrying kids around going
stairs back forth refrigerator formula, et cetera, well burning
energy, burning calories. even physically active, unless
ultra marathoner marathoner, chances 75% metabolic
needs coming just brain. neurons consume lot
energy. Neurons, course, just nerve cells brain. two
hormones, thyroid hormone growth hormone, think related metabolism
things body, keeping body fat low, keeping muscles strong, tendons
strong repairing themselves, et cetera, also key brain function,
ability maintain cognitive function throughout lifespan. big theme like
introduce metabolism isn't just losing weight high
metabolism, provided not high, great. means will lean
tissue, bone muscle less adipose tissue, fat. know
healthy. much fat much muscle? Well, varies, numbers
always shifting. general, muscle related tissues burns energy
adipose tissue fat. water body doesn't consume
energy. metabolism can increased simply adding muscle body
reducing fat adjusting ratio two. regardless, even not interested
changing body composition, two hormones, thyroid hormone growth
hormone, super important metabolism kinds, including tissue repair
injury, including maintaining cognitive function well-being ability think
clearly age, offsetting dementia forth. big theme really
includes previous episodes. don't seen episodes
last three episodes today well, talking hormones,


substances released one location body go act
locations body. going tell works thyroid growth
hormone. now heard testosterone estrogen going
hear thyroid growth hormone, want realize repeating
logic.

00:17:33 Releasing Hormones Brain, Stimulating Hormones
Pituitary

First all, neurons brain area called hypothalamus,
just means thalamus, hypo. sits base brain, front,
part forebrain. less roof mouth, maybe
centimeter so, centimeter forward people. neurons
hypothalamus release hormones called releasing hormones.
talked previous episodes about, instance, gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
little neurons signal another brain area called pituitary
release hormones. Today, going see again. brain,
neurons release thyrotropin thyroid-releasing hormone. also growth
hormone-releasing hormone. anytime hear releasing, chances
neurons brain extend little wires call axons
pituitary pituitary releases bunch hormones bloodstream.
pituitary releases things often name stimulating hormone
stimulate organs. keeping theme thyroid hormone,
thyroid-releasing hormone brain, tells pituitary release thyroid-stimulating
hormone thyroid, talk moment, releases thyroid
hormones. testosterone estrogen episode, talked

00:22:45 Iodine, L-Tyrosine & Selenium: Trio Essential Thyroid Function

right already discussing tools iodine. Iodine comes things
ocean, right? couple interesting facts iodine. talk
whether not supplementing iodine not. First all, iodine
common sea salt, kelp seaweed. people can get enough
iodine food eat and/or table salt consume. Almost table salt
world, regardless are, contains iodine. thyroid needs
iodine order produce thyroid hormone. need sufficient levels thyroid
hormone, not much, need it. chances getting enough iodine.
Although, might not, especially following particularly, quote, unquote,
clean diet, might not getting enough iodine. deal iodine. Iodine
combines amino acid talked called L-tyrosine. L-tyrosine
comes meat, nuts. plant-based sources well.
precursor dopamine. thyroid, iodine combines works L-tyrosine
produce T3 T4, thyroid hormone. absolutely need sufficient iodine,
need sufficient L-tyrosine, also need something else, called
selenium. talk selenium moment. condition shows
little pockets world. not super common, meaning not widespread,
certain areas far away ocean, one point, historically
Midwestern states United States, mountain regions countries,
areas Africa far ocean, people get extremely
swollen bulges necks. called goiter. reason
getting swollen bulges thyroid hypertrophying.
growing attempt churn thyroid. getting lot
stimulating hormone pituitary. don't want go far off track
recall, brain pituitary paying attention cellular sense levels
hormones blood. hormones get high, shut off


stimulating hormone, shut signal make more, kind like thermostat.
levels low, like not enough testosterone bloodstream
not enough estrogen, brain will continue push signal make more.
Similarly, not enough thyroid circulating not enough iodine make
thyroid, therefore not enough thyroid hormone circulating, thyroid gland not
getting shut down. tons stimulating hormone releasing hormone coming
brain, like release, release, release, no way can make thyroid
hormone gland just gets bigger bigger bigger. people get
goiter. one reasons table salt iodine it. Although
foods iodine well. much iodine need?

00:26:05 Much Iodine Need? Food, Supplement Ocean Air

Well, don't need whole lot. people hypothyroidal might, want
emphasize might, absolutely talk doctor. serious matter.
Anytime talking hormones manipulating levels thyroid, absolutely
want talk doctor. people benefit supplementing iodine.
contained salts. Himalayan salt, not always, often. know days,
lot excitement pink salts sea salts what, know,
kind artisan salt thing kind taken off foodie land, great.
actually quite tasty. can just take directly like taste salt.
iodine can supplemented things like kelp seaweed kelp tablets.
Now, hyperthyroidal, make much thyroid, actually can
problem. really, best way figure get blood levels tested
thyroid hormone. much iodine ocean believe not people
live near coast can actually just absorb air, just breathing ocean
air. gives sense just little iodine actually need consume
food salt. within miles ocean visit ocean
time time, probably getting plenty. come together,
mentioned, L-tyrosine, foods contain L-tyrosine, provided
sufficient iodine diet, sufficient selenium
diet, serve increase metabolism. growth repair
tissues. really important. not just keeping metabolism high
can leaner side things adjust body weight, excuse me,

00:28:09 Selenium Thyroid: Brazil Nuts & Valuable Sources

not just body mass indexes things sort. talk selenium
really important. even though people getting lot sufficient
iodine, people probably getting enough L-tyrosine. guessing
people may not getting enough selenium goal increase thyroid hormone,
least literature says. Without going biochemistry, selenium
important order thyroid hormone made way allows L-
tyrosine iodine interact. thing people aren't getting enough
selenium don't eat foods high selenium. Now, much
selenium need will depend live. actually varies country country.
countries found say get 100 micrograms, say 200,
say 155. average 155 micrograms, countries looked at. People
trying increase thyroid levels might want consume selenium.
consume vitamin, course, want make sure selenium not
overdoing consuming lot selenium rich foods either. nonetheless, think
fair say people probably well ingesting slightly selenium
currently are. Although, course, always talk doctor. Brazil nuts
heavyweight champion foods get selenium from. high concentrations
selenium. just six eight Brazil nuts contain something like 550 micrograms
selenium. also present fish. certain fish like yellowfin tuna, although nowadays
whenever mention tuna shellfish, rich source selenium, people
will tell immediately sorts issues around farm, not farm, mercury, et
cetera. never particularly liked eating fish 'cause way tastes.
avoid it. like it, sure much skilled
knowing fish buy fish not buy. Ham, things, contains lot
selenium, whatever reason pork does. not big consumer pork. Beef
selenium, interesting look sources, know, pork, beef, turkey,
chicken, cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice, want understand Brazil


nuts, six eight Brazil nuts 550 micrograms selenium. foods
mentioned much greater portion size equivalent six eight Brazil nuts, either
volume calories, something like 30 50 micrograms selenium.
not eating Brazil nuts, guessing people aren't, not eating
lot animal based foods, know many aren't, probably not
getting enough selenium. again, can levels measured can
just check consuming figure whether not meeting ration
need order get healthy levels thyroid. present things like
mushrooms, again, bowl mushrooms, know, equivalent
bowl mushroom 12 micrograms selenium. daily ration something
100 200 range, again, look area are. can see really quickly
even though things like mushrooms spinach milk yogurt lentils
cashews, now vegetarian segment list constructed,
probably not getting enough selenium. kind interesting thing.
experimenter get clearance doctor, try increasing
selenium levels see impacts metabolism. Again, Brazil nuts
probably going direct way get sufficient selenium levels
levels high Brazil nuts, also means overdo well. not
really aware consequences getting much selenium, although
can get much anything guessing consequences aren't good. also
want mention children, daily requirements selenium much lower,
low 30 40 micrograms kids 14 years younger. areas, really
want underscore this, amount selenium recommended daily low
55 micrograms. not shooting thousands even high levels
hundreds micrograms selenium. again, micrograms, not milligrams.
again, look need somebody interested keeping
thyroid function healthy productive, certainly want make sure
getting enough iodine, getting enough selenium getting enough L-
tyrosine. interesting start looking various foods, especially highly
processed foods, start realize

00:33:05 Selenium Pregnancy, Prostate Cancer Risk, Acne

perhaps many people, maybe you, not. Not incidentally, selenium


effects health can quite positive. even though don't relate
thyroid growth hormone function specifically, think might want know
them, given topic selenium. first three studies,
showed high efficacy reducing risk something called
preeclampsia, excuse me, preeclampsia. Preeclampsia seizures related
blood pressure issues around delivery new baby. actually,
rare-ish condition actually can quite deadly. fact selenium
important offsetting preeclampsia risk interesting. don't know exact
mechanism guessing either
pregnant thinking conceiving soon, worth noting. Obviously, anything
related pregnancy lactation, especially talk doctor. guessing
selenium probably lot prenatal formulas one clear benefit

just additional benefits getting sufficient selenium.

00:35:20 “Clean Eating” Downsides: Cruciferous Vegetables, Leeching Iodine

Okay, already deep tools related making sure sufficient
selenium, iodine, L-tyrosine order make enough thyroid hormones can
support metabolic processes liver, muscles, tendons, whatever
purpose, keeping metabolism high, body composition reasons healing,
keeping brain working well. Earlier mentioned, people following
clean diets. people consume no processed foods. know,
starch might eat going maybe rice grain protein might


consume going either from, hope, humanely raised animal sources
maybe pure plant-based. Believe not, folks actually
susceptible low iodine turns diets meat rich don't
many vegetables, well diets vegetable rich don't many
meats salts risk lowering thyroid hormone way iodine pathway
pathways. let try simplify you. Chances people
all-meat diet, not sprinkling, not wrapping steaks
seaweed may may not supplementing iodine. Chances
probably consuming iodine salt requirements go not consuming
vegetables. People consuming vegetables kind interesting. always
hear cruciferous vegetables important
actually substances, compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables
can interfere thyroid hormone function. eating lot stuff, lot
cabbages just look other, think broccoli cruciferous vegetable,
won't read off whole list, just put internet. always told
eat lot dark, leafy green stuff. Well, unless dark, leafy green stuff kelp
seaweed, chances not getting enough iodine unless adding salt
food. chances may lowering total amount thyroid
making, well fact plant-rich diets, hard get enough L-tyrosine
don't want, know, not inflame vegans carnivore folks.
don't take stance either way that. just learning, trying report
science. point want make health important. purely plant-
based eating lot cruciferous vegetables, make sure getting
enough iodine. seem like cruciferous vegetables can increase need
iodine. thing purely all-meat diet keto,
not ingesting many vegetables. always thought cleaner diet,
better, turns probably true standpoint of, know, hormone
regulation, know, estrogen testosterone hormones. highly
processed foods really terrible. much evidence that. phthalates
plastics processed foods emulsifiers, stuff talked
previous episode, seem people not getting enough iodine
whatever reason, really need check whether not iodine levels need
increased fact consuming many plants many
meats cases, plants actually lower thyroid hormone. not beat

00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.

slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax

repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours

Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves

waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell

abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release

IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional
conversation. brain telling body hormones make. hormones
influencing tissues body also telling brain

00:11:43 Stevia: Naming & Impact

putting information world. just, know, back away
slowly. One thing, move today's material, last episode, talked
problems emulsifiers highly processed foods way can
strip mucosal lining gut. can limit signaling hormones like CCK
can signal brain satiety, signal stop eating. got
discussion artificial sweeteners threw Stevia artificial sweetener.
several people reached correct Stevia not artificial sweetener,
noncaloric sweetener, correct. lumped artificial noncaloric
sweeteners together. thanks many also sent references.
not appear Stevia can negatively impact gut microbiome. seem
unique among noncaloric sweeteners. probably others there.
thing discussed Stevia can lead slight increases blood glucose
can also improve insulin management just slightly, probably cancels zero terms
impact blood glucose, provided not concentrations super, super
sweet. Ingestion anything sweet, whether not contains calories not,
artificial not, will create insulin response. fact, just walking past bakery

00:13:30 Metabolism 101: Brain Furnace

please keep feedback particular things cover
coming way. much interest metabolism. hear high
low metabolism. people like reduce
metabolism. simply can't eat enough maintain weight. people,
however, struggle opposite issue. struggle maintain healthy weight
and/or metabolism low. Now, variety reasons metabolism
can low. Today, going talk two hormones, thyroid hormone
related pathways growth hormone related pathways, arguably


two hormones two systems body significant setting
overall level metabolism. dive those, just want cover little bit
metabolism is. want talk organs body use
energy. metabolism consumption energy, not necessarily eating,
use energy cells body growth tissues, repair tissues, also
just day-to-day maintenance function. good example maintenance function
brain. metabolic needs, so-called basal resting
metabolic needs brain, thinking. just sit bed day
nothing think, consumes 75% metabolic needs. Now,
also moving around. job requires lot heavy labor lifting things
new parent carrying kids around going
stairs back forth refrigerator formula, et cetera, well burning
energy, burning calories. even physically active, unless
ultra marathoner marathoner, chances 75% metabolic
needs coming just brain. neurons consume lot
energy. Neurons, course, just nerve cells brain. two
hormones, thyroid hormone growth hormone, think related metabolism
things body, keeping body fat low, keeping muscles strong, tendons
strong repairing themselves, et cetera, also key brain function,
ability maintain cognitive function throughout lifespan. big theme like
introduce metabolism isn't just losing weight high
metabolism, provided not high, great. means will lean
tissue, bone muscle less adipose tissue, fat. know
healthy. much fat much muscle? Well, varies, numbers
always shifting. general, muscle related tissues burns energy
adipose tissue fat. water body doesn't consume
energy. metabolism can increased simply adding muscle body
reducing fat adjusting ratio two. regardless, even not interested
changing body composition, two hormones, thyroid hormone growth
hormone, super important metabolism kinds, including tissue repair
injury, including maintaining cognitive function well-being ability think
clearly age, offsetting dementia forth. big theme really
includes previous episodes. don't seen episodes
last three episodes today well, talking hormones,


substances released one location body go act
locations body. going tell works thyroid growth
hormone. now heard testosterone estrogen going
hear thyroid growth hormone, want realize repeating
logic.

00:17:33 Releasing Hormones Brain, Stimulating Hormones
Pituitary

First all, neurons brain area called hypothalamus,
just means thalamus, hypo. sits base brain, front,
part forebrain. less roof mouth, maybe
centimeter so, centimeter forward people. neurons
hypothalamus release hormones called releasing hormones.
talked previous episodes about, instance, gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
little neurons signal another brain area called pituitary
release hormones. Today, going see again. brain,
neurons release thyrotropin thyroid-releasing hormone. also growth
hormone-releasing hormone. anytime hear releasing, chances
neurons brain extend little wires call axons
pituitary pituitary releases bunch hormones bloodstream.
pituitary releases things often name stimulating hormone
stimulate organs. keeping theme thyroid hormone,
thyroid-releasing hormone brain, tells pituitary release thyroid-stimulating
hormone thyroid, talk moment, releases thyroid
hormones. testosterone estrogen episode, talked
gonadotropin-releasing hormone, releasing again, brain.
Remember, releasing hormone comes brain. things like
luteinizing hormone follicle-stimulating hormone, pituitary
traveled ovaries testes acted tissues, okay? please
try embed logic. hear word releasing hormone, coming
brain, makes actionable certain ways return later. addition,
pituitary letting go hormones bloodstream stimulating
different tissues. thyroid, thyroid-stimulating hormone. goes


thyroid. thyroid little butterfly-shaped gland right around Adam's
apple. want see yours, not directly 'cause got skin it,
take sip water, look mirror swallow. thing
moves down, thyroid. Now, people call Adam's apple
sits right near protrusion trachea, Adam's apple. No
matter, whether not male, female, regardless chromosomal
background is, everyone Adam's apple. tends pronounced people
got surge testosterone early development testosterone
sensitivity it. actually controls timbre, so-called deepness voice.
thyroid gland sits right got four little bumps behind called
parathyroid gland. releases two hormones blood stimulate different
tissues metabolism. hormones called T4 T3.
already sounding like lot information, really easy, promise. Releasing hormone
comes brain. Stimulating hormone comes pituitary. case,
talking thyroid, binding stimulating hormone saying, oh,
need release something. releases T4 T3. guess what? can
basically forget T4. T4, not completely inactive, roles,

00:21:04 Thyroid Hormone’s Real Effects: Growth, Repair Energy Consumption
Tissues

T3 one less active. Now, thyroid hormone do? lot
people think, oh, thyroid, like metabolism people hyperthyroidal
bulging eyes real thin people hypothyroid overweight
eyes like are, know, half closed something. indeed thyroid hormone
controls lot features face eyes. can control amounts
adipose tissue forth. main role thyroid hormone, T3, promote
metabolism. doesn't just mean consumption energy, means
utilization energy, including buildup tissues. acts sorts target
tissues body. acts muscle, acts liver, acts cartilage, acts
bone. not just involved using energy, also converting energy.
realize said twice. involved taking fats breaking fatty
acids converting ATP, important thing cells use energy.
also involved taking sugars turning energy. yes, goes


adipose tissue fat. different kinds fat talk today goes
white fat liberates helps liberate fats fat cells use
energy. higher thyroid associated leaner bodies. Lower
thyroid associated less lean bodies. one thing absolutely key
actionable,

00:22:45 Iodine, L-Tyrosine & Selenium: Trio Essential Thyroid Function

right already discussing tools iodine. Iodine comes things
ocean, right? couple interesting facts iodine. talk
whether not supplementing iodine not. First all, iodine
common sea salt, kelp seaweed. people can get enough
iodine food eat and/or table salt consume. Almost table salt
world, regardless are, contains iodine. thyroid needs
iodine order produce thyroid hormone. need sufficient levels thyroid
hormone, not much, need it. chances getting enough iodine.
Although, might not, especially following particularly, quote, unquote,
clean diet, might not getting enough iodine. deal iodine. Iodine
combines amino acid talked called L-tyrosine. L-tyrosine
comes meat, nuts. plant-based sources well.
precursor dopamine. thyroid, iodine combines works L-tyrosine
produce T3 T4, thyroid hormone. absolutely need sufficient iodine,
need sufficient L-tyrosine, also need something else, called
selenium. talk selenium moment. condition shows
little pockets world. not super common, meaning not widespread,
certain areas far away ocean, one point, historically
Midwestern states United States, mountain regions countries,
areas Africa far ocean, people get extremely
swollen bulges necks. called goiter. reason
getting swollen bulges thyroid hypertrophying.
growing attempt churn thyroid. getting lot
stimulating hormone pituitary. don't want go far off track
recall, brain pituitary paying attention cellular sense levels
hormones blood. hormones get high, shut off


stimulating hormone, shut signal make more, kind like thermostat.
levels low, like not enough testosterone bloodstream
not enough estrogen, brain will continue push signal make more.
Similarly, not enough thyroid circulating not enough iodine make
thyroid, therefore not enough thyroid hormone circulating, thyroid gland not
getting shut down. tons stimulating hormone releasing hormone coming
brain, like release, release, release, no way can make thyroid
hormone gland just gets bigger bigger bigger. people get
goiter. one reasons table salt iodine it. Although
foods iodine well. much iodine need?

00:26:05 Much Iodine Need? Food, Supplement Ocean Air

Well, don't need whole lot. people hypothyroidal might, want
emphasize might, absolutely talk doctor. serious matter.
Anytime talking hormones manipulating levels thyroid, absolutely
want talk doctor. people benefit supplementing iodine.
contained salts. Himalayan salt, not always, often. know days,
lot excitement pink salts sea salts what, know,
kind artisan salt thing kind taken off foodie land, great.
actually quite tasty. can just take directly like taste salt.
iodine can supplemented things like kelp seaweed kelp tablets.
Now, hyperthyroidal, make much thyroid, actually can
problem. really, best way figure get blood levels tested
thyroid hormone. much iodine ocean believe not people
live near coast can actually just absorb air, just breathing ocean
air. gives sense just little iodine actually need consume
food salt. within miles ocean visit ocean
time time, probably getting plenty. come together,
mentioned, L-tyrosine, foods contain L-tyrosine, provided
sufficient iodine diet, sufficient selenium
diet, serve increase metabolism. growth repair
tissues. really important. not just keeping metabolism high
can leaner side things adjust body weight, excuse me,


body composition ratios way like. Repair injuries, repair brain tissue,
clearance damage neurons, clearance damage body also
going depend thyroid. Again, metabolism kind rate fuel
consumption use body, generally,

00:28:09 Selenium Thyroid: Brazil Nuts & Valuable Sources

not just body mass indexes things sort. talk selenium
really important. even though people getting lot sufficient
iodine, people probably getting enough L-tyrosine. guessing
people may not getting enough selenium goal increase thyroid hormone,
least literature says. Without going biochemistry, selenium
important order thyroid hormone made way allows L-
tyrosine iodine interact. thing people aren't getting enough
selenium don't eat foods high selenium. Now, much
selenium need will depend live. actually varies country country.
countries found say get 100 micrograms, say 200,
say 155. average 155 micrograms, countries looked at. People
trying increase thyroid levels might want consume selenium.
consume vitamin, course, want make sure selenium not
overdoing consuming lot selenium rich foods either. nonetheless, think
fair say people probably well ingesting slightly selenium
currently are. Although, course, always talk doctor. Brazil nuts
heavyweight champion foods get selenium from. high concentrations
selenium. just six eight Brazil nuts contain something like 550 micrograms
selenium. also present fish. certain fish like yellowfin tuna, although nowadays
whenever mention tuna shellfish, rich source selenium, people
will tell immediately sorts issues around farm, not farm, mercury, et
cetera. never particularly liked eating fish 'cause way tastes.
avoid it. like it, sure much skilled
knowing fish buy fish not buy. Ham, things, contains lot
selenium, whatever reason pork does. not big consumer pork. Beef
selenium, interesting look sources, know, pork, beef, turkey,
chicken, cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice, want understand Brazil


nuts, six eight Brazil nuts 550 micrograms selenium. foods
mentioned much greater portion size equivalent six eight Brazil nuts, either
volume calories, something like 30 50 micrograms selenium.
not eating Brazil nuts, guessing people aren't, not eating
lot animal based foods, know many aren't, probably not
getting enough selenium. again, can levels measured can
just check consuming figure whether not meeting ration
need order get healthy levels thyroid. present things like
mushrooms, again, bowl mushrooms, know, equivalent
bowl mushroom 12 micrograms selenium. daily ration something
100 200 range, again, look area are. can see really quickly
even though things like mushrooms spinach milk yogurt lentils
cashews, now vegetarian segment list constructed,
probably not getting enough selenium. kind interesting thing.
experimenter get clearance doctor, try increasing
selenium levels see impacts metabolism. Again, Brazil nuts
probably going direct way get sufficient selenium levels
levels high Brazil nuts, also means overdo well. not
really aware consequences getting much selenium, although
can get much anything guessing consequences aren't good. also
want mention children, daily requirements selenium much lower,
low 30 40 micrograms kids 14 years younger. areas, really
want underscore this, amount selenium recommended daily low
55 micrograms. not shooting thousands even high levels
hundreds micrograms selenium. again, micrograms, not milligrams.
again, look need somebody interested keeping
thyroid function healthy productive, certainly want make sure
getting enough iodine, getting enough selenium getting enough L-
tyrosine. interesting start looking various foods, especially highly
processed foods, start realize

00:33:05 Selenium Pregnancy, Prostate Cancer Risk, Acne

perhaps many people, maybe you, not. Not incidentally, selenium


effects health can quite positive. even though don't relate
thyroid growth hormone function specifically, think might want know
them, given topic selenium. first three studies,
showed high efficacy reducing risk something called
preeclampsia, excuse me, preeclampsia. Preeclampsia seizures related
blood pressure issues around delivery new baby. actually,
rare-ish condition actually can quite deadly. fact selenium
important offsetting preeclampsia risk interesting. don't know exact
mechanism guessing either
pregnant thinking conceiving soon, worth noting. Obviously, anything
related pregnancy lactation, especially talk doctor. guessing
selenium probably lot prenatal formulas one clear benefit
sufficient selenium. reduced prostate cancer risk. study showing
sufficient selenium can reduce prostate cancer risk.
evidence consume foods areas soil low selenium, can
problem. last episode, talked issues related soil quality,
things making way food disrupting hormones forth.
sufficient selenium food offset low content soil.
apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk. minor effect statistically
significant one. one reduction acne, interesting.
guessing probably thyroid hormone pathway
way thyroid hormone can impact liver. turns liver various
biochemical reactions liver can impact acne. probably episode
just additional benefits getting sufficient selenium.

00:35:20 “Clean Eating” Downsides: Cruciferous Vegetables, Leeching Iodine

Okay, already deep tools related making sure sufficient
selenium, iodine, L-tyrosine order make enough thyroid hormones can
support metabolic processes liver, muscles, tendons, whatever
purpose, keeping metabolism high, body composition reasons healing,
keeping brain working well. Earlier mentioned, people following
clean diets. people consume no processed foods. know,
starch might eat going maybe rice grain protein might


consume going either from, hope, humanely raised animal sources
maybe pure plant-based. Believe not, folks actually
susceptible low iodine turns diets meat rich don't
many vegetables, well diets vegetable rich don't many
meats salts risk lowering thyroid hormone way iodine pathway
pathways. let try simplify you. Chances people
all-meat diet, not sprinkling, not wrapping steaks
seaweed may may not supplementing iodine. Chances
probably consuming iodine salt requirements go not consuming
vegetables. People consuming vegetables kind interesting. always
hear cruciferous vegetables important
actually substances, compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables
can interfere thyroid hormone function. eating lot stuff, lot
cabbages just look other, think broccoli cruciferous vegetable,
won't read off whole list, just put internet. always told
eat lot dark, leafy green stuff. Well, unless dark, leafy green stuff kelp
seaweed, chances not getting enough iodine unless adding salt
food. chances may lowering total amount thyroid
making, well fact plant-rich diets, hard get enough L-tyrosine
don't want, know, not inflame vegans carnivore folks.
don't take stance either way that. just learning, trying report
science. point want make health important. purely plant-
based eating lot cruciferous vegetables, make sure getting
enough iodine. seem like cruciferous vegetables can increase need
iodine. thing purely all-meat diet keto,
not ingesting many vegetables. always thought cleaner diet,
better, turns probably true standpoint of, know, hormone
regulation, know, estrogen testosterone hormones. highly
processed foods really terrible. much evidence that. phthalates
plastics processed foods emulsifiers, stuff talked
previous episode, seem people not getting enough iodine
whatever reason, really need check whether not iodine levels need
increased fact consuming many plants many
meats cases, plants actually lower thyroid hormone. not beat


dead horse cabbage,

00:39:00 Benefits Iodine: Reducing Inflammation

number things iodine can positive sort of,

anti-inflammatory effect brings us back old friend, interleukin 6. Remember,
inflammatory cytokines. many, many names
many, many them. Interleukin 10 one anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6
one inflammatory. Anytime see IL-6, usually means
inflammatory response, wound, inflammation brain, somebody
either sleep deprived brain injury dealing sort infection.
IL-6 kind catch-all inflammation. appear iodine
supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated inflammation.

'cause can eat still maintain healthy body composition, also
brain health, cognitive function, tissue repair, stuff, keeping c-reactive protein low,
keeping IL-6 low, make sure getting enough iodine, selenium L-tyrosine.

00:41:00 & Increased Thyroid Increases Metabolism

curious thyroid actually increases metabolism, allows eat more,
et cetera. relates something covered last issue, glucose. Remember
eat something, blood sugar goes up, insulin secreted pancreas
makes sure blood glucose doesn't go high, can damage tissues

00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work

sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth

growth hormone. reasons certain people want that.
People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,

00:53:40 Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know Natural TriggerS



talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth

want emphasize, talk doctor anything, including remove
treatments. anything add take away, responsibility
healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly
tissue repair, et cetera, need get slow-wave sleep so-called deep
sleep need blood insulin glucose relatively low. eating within two
hours sleep,

00:54:49 Not Eating Within 2hrs Sleep: Keep Blood Glucose Low(ish) Sleep

excuse me, eating within two hours going sleep going suppress growth

falling asleep hungry. work decide
going eat. going eat thing not hungry
trouble falling asleep. episodes sleep covered
episodes two, three, four Huberman Lab Podcast has, believe, tools
ever want make use terms optimize sleep.
can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional

two hormones two systems body significant setting
overall level metabolism. dive those, just want cover little bit
metabolism is. want talk organs body use
energy. metabolism consumption energy, not necessarily eating,
use energy cells body growth tissues, repair tissues, also
just day-to-day maintenance function. good example maintenance function

clearly age, offsetting dementia forth. big theme really
includes previous episodes. don't seen episodes
last three episodes today well, talking hormones,


substances released one location body go act
locations body. going tell works thyroid growth
hormone. now heard testosterone estrogen going
hear thyroid growth hormone, want realize repeating
logic.

00:17:33 Releasing Hormones Brain, Stimulating Hormones
Pituitary

First all, neurons brain area called hypothalamus,
just means thalamus, hypo. sits base brain, front,
part forebrain. less roof mouth, maybe
centimeter so, centimeter forward people. neurons
hypothalamus release hormones called releasing hormones.
talked previous episodes about, instance, gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
little neurons signal another brain area called pituitary
release hormones. Today, going see again. brain,
neurons release thyrotropin thyroid-releasing hormone. also growth
hormone-releasing hormone. anytime hear releasing, chances
neurons brain extend little wires call axons
pituitary pituitary releases bunch hormones bloodstream.
pituitary releases things often name stimulating hormone
stimulate organs. keeping theme thyroid hormone,
thyroid-releasing hormone brain, tells pituitary release thyroid-stimulating
hormone thyroid, talk moment, releases thyroid
hormones. testosterone estrogen episode, talked
gonadotropin-releasing hormone, releasing again, brain.
Remember, releasing hormone comes brain. things like
luteinizing hormone follicle-stimulating hormone, pituitary
traveled ovaries testes acted tissues, okay? please
try embed logic. hear word releasing hormone, coming
brain, makes actionable certain ways return later. addition,
pituitary letting go hormones bloodstream stimulating
different tissues. thyroid, thyroid-stimulating hormone. goes


thyroid. thyroid little butterfly-shaped gland right around Adam's
apple. want see yours, not directly 'cause got skin it,
take sip water, look mirror swallow. thing
moves down, thyroid. Now, people call Adam's apple
sits right near protrusion trachea, Adam's apple. No
matter, whether not male, female, regardless chromosomal
background is, everyone Adam's apple. tends pronounced people
got surge testosterone early development testosterone
sensitivity it. actually controls timbre, so-called deepness voice.
thyroid gland sits right got four little bumps behind called
parathyroid gland. releases two hormones blood stimulate different
tissues metabolism. hormones called T4 T3.
already sounding like lot information, really easy, promise. Releasing hormone
comes brain. Stimulating hormone comes pituitary. case,
talking thyroid, binding stimulating hormone saying, oh,
need release something. releases T4 T3. guess what? can
basically forget T4. T4, not completely inactive, roles,

00:21:04 Thyroid Hormone’s Real Effects: Growth, Repair Energy Consumption
Tissues

T3 one less active. Now, thyroid hormone do? lot
people think, oh, thyroid, like metabolism people hyperthyroidal
bulging eyes real thin people hypothyroid overweight
eyes like are, know, half closed something. indeed thyroid hormone
controls lot features face eyes. can control amounts
adipose tissue forth. main role thyroid hormone, T3, promote
metabolism. doesn't just mean consumption energy, means
utilization energy, including buildup tissues. acts sorts target
tissues body. acts muscle, acts liver, acts cartilage, acts
bone. not just involved using energy, also converting energy.
realize said twice. involved taking fats breaking fatty
acids converting ATP, important thing cells use energy.
also involved taking sugars turning energy. yes, goes


adipose tissue fat. different kinds fat talk today goes
white fat liberates helps liberate fats fat cells use
energy. higher thyroid associated leaner bodies. Lower
thyroid associated less lean bodies. one thing absolutely key
actionable,

00:22:45 Iodine, L-Tyrosine & Selenium: Trio Essential Thyroid Function

right already discussing tools iodine. Iodine comes things
ocean, right? couple interesting facts iodine. talk
whether not supplementing iodine not. First all, iodine
common sea salt, kelp seaweed. people can get enough
iodine food eat and/or table salt consume. Almost table salt
world, regardless are, contains iodine. thyroid needs
iodine order produce thyroid hormone. need sufficient levels thyroid
hormone, not much, need it. chances getting enough iodine.
Although, might not, especially following particularly, quote, unquote,
clean diet, might not getting enough iodine. deal iodine. Iodine
combines amino acid talked called L-tyrosine. L-tyrosine
comes meat, nuts. plant-based sources well.
precursor dopamine. thyroid, iodine combines works L-tyrosine
produce T3 T4, thyroid hormone. absolutely need sufficient iodine,
need sufficient L-tyrosine, also need something else, called
selenium. talk selenium moment. condition shows
little pockets world. not super common, meaning not widespread,
certain areas far away ocean, one point, historically
Midwestern states United States, mountain regions countries,
areas Africa far ocean, people get extremely
swollen bulges necks. called goiter. reason
getting swollen bulges thyroid hypertrophying.
growing attempt churn thyroid. getting lot
stimulating hormone pituitary. don't want go far off track
recall, brain pituitary paying attention cellular sense levels
hormones blood. hormones get high, shut off


stimulating hormone, shut signal make more, kind like thermostat.
levels low, like not enough testosterone bloodstream
not enough estrogen, brain will continue push signal make more.
Similarly, not enough thyroid circulating not enough iodine make
thyroid, therefore not enough thyroid hormone circulating, thyroid gland not
getting shut down. tons stimulating hormone releasing hormone coming
brain, like release, release, release, no way can make thyroid
hormone gland just gets bigger bigger bigger. people get
goiter. one reasons table salt iodine it. Although
foods iodine well. much iodine need?

00:26:05 Much Iodine Need? Food, Supplement Ocean Air

Well, don't need whole lot. people hypothyroidal might, want
emphasize might, absolutely talk doctor. serious matter.
Anytime talking hormones manipulating levels thyroid, absolutely
want talk doctor. people benefit supplementing iodine.
contained salts. Himalayan salt, not always, often. know days,
lot excitement pink salts sea salts what, know,
kind artisan salt thing kind taken off foodie land, great.
actually quite tasty. can just take directly like taste salt.
iodine can supplemented things like kelp seaweed kelp tablets.
Now, hyperthyroidal, make much thyroid, actually can
problem. really, best way figure get blood levels tested
thyroid hormone. much iodine ocean believe not people
live near coast can actually just absorb air, just breathing ocean
air. gives sense just little iodine actually need consume
food salt. within miles ocean visit ocean
time time, probably getting plenty. come together,
mentioned, L-tyrosine, foods contain L-tyrosine, provided
sufficient iodine diet, sufficient selenium
diet, serve increase metabolism. growth repair
tissues. really important. not just keeping metabolism high
can leaner side things adjust body weight, excuse me,


body composition ratios way like. Repair injuries, repair brain tissue,
clearance damage neurons, clearance damage body also
going depend thyroid. Again, metabolism kind rate fuel
consumption use body, generally,

00:28:09 Selenium Thyroid: Brazil Nuts & Valuable Sources

not just body mass indexes things sort. talk selenium
really important. even though people getting lot sufficient
iodine, people probably getting enough L-tyrosine. guessing
people may not getting enough selenium goal increase thyroid hormone,
least literature says. Without going biochemistry, selenium
important order thyroid hormone made way allows L-
tyrosine iodine interact. thing people aren't getting enough
selenium don't eat foods high selenium. Now, much
selenium need will depend live. actually varies country country.
countries found say get 100 micrograms, say 200,
say 155. average 155 micrograms, countries looked at. People
trying increase thyroid levels might want consume selenium.
consume vitamin, course, want make sure selenium not
overdoing consuming lot selenium rich foods either. nonetheless, think
fair say people probably well ingesting slightly selenium
currently are. Although, course, always talk doctor. Brazil nuts
heavyweight champion foods get selenium from. high concentrations
selenium. just six eight Brazil nuts contain something like 550 micrograms
selenium. also present fish. certain fish like yellowfin tuna, although nowadays
whenever mention tuna shellfish, rich source selenium, people
will tell immediately sorts issues around farm, not farm, mercury, et
cetera. never particularly liked eating fish 'cause way tastes.
avoid it. like it, sure much skilled
knowing fish buy fish not buy. Ham, things, contains lot
selenium, whatever reason pork does. not big consumer pork. Beef
selenium, interesting look sources, know, pork, beef, turkey,
chicken, cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice, want understand Brazil


nuts, six eight Brazil nuts 550 micrograms selenium. foods
mentioned much greater portion size equivalent six eight Brazil nuts, either
volume calories, something like 30 50 micrograms selenium.
not eating Brazil nuts, guessing people aren't, not eating
lot animal based foods, know many aren't, probably not
getting enough selenium. again, can levels measured can
just check consuming figure whether not meeting ration
need order get healthy levels thyroid. present things like
mushrooms, again, bowl mushrooms, know, equivalent
bowl mushroom 12 micrograms selenium. daily ration something
100 200 range, again, look area are. can see really quickly
even though things like mushrooms spinach milk yogurt lentils
cashews, now vegetarian segment list constructed,
probably not getting enough selenium. kind interesting thing.
experimenter get clearance doctor, try increasing
selenium levels see impacts metabolism. Again, Brazil nuts
probably going direct way get sufficient selenium levels
levels high Brazil nuts, also means overdo well. not
really aware consequences getting much selenium, although
can get much anything guessing consequences aren't good. also
want mention children, daily requirements selenium much lower,
low 30 40 micrograms kids 14 years younger. areas, really
want underscore this, amount selenium recommended daily low
55 micrograms. not shooting thousands even high levels
hundreds micrograms selenium. again, micrograms, not milligrams.
again, look need somebody interested keeping
thyroid function healthy productive, certainly want make sure
getting enough iodine, getting enough selenium getting enough L-
tyrosine. interesting start looking various foods, especially highly
processed foods, start realize

00:33:05 Selenium Pregnancy, Prostate Cancer Risk, Acne

perhaps many people, maybe you, not. Not incidentally, selenium


effects health can quite positive. even though don't relate
thyroid growth hormone function specifically, think might want know
them, given topic selenium. first three studies,
showed high efficacy reducing risk something called
preeclampsia, excuse me, preeclampsia. Preeclampsia seizures related
blood pressure issues around delivery new baby. actually,
rare-ish condition actually can quite deadly. fact selenium
important offsetting preeclampsia risk interesting. don't know exact
mechanism guessing either
pregnant thinking conceiving soon, worth noting. Obviously, anything
related pregnancy lactation, especially talk doctor. guessing
selenium probably lot prenatal formulas one clear benefit
sufficient selenium. reduced prostate cancer risk. study showing
sufficient selenium can reduce prostate cancer risk.
evidence consume foods areas soil low selenium, can
problem. last episode, talked issues related soil quality,
things making way food disrupting hormones forth.
sufficient selenium food offset low content soil.
apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk. minor effect statistically
significant one. one reduction acne, interesting.
guessing probably thyroid hormone pathway
way thyroid hormone can impact liver. turns liver various
biochemical reactions liver can impact acne. probably episode
just additional benefits getting sufficient selenium.

00:35:20 “Clean Eating” Downsides: Cruciferous Vegetables, Leeching Iodine

Okay, already deep tools related making sure sufficient
selenium, iodine, L-tyrosine order make enough thyroid hormones can
support metabolic processes liver, muscles, tendons, whatever
purpose, keeping metabolism high, body composition reasons healing,
keeping brain working well. Earlier mentioned, people following
clean diets. people consume no processed foods. know,
starch might eat going maybe rice grain protein might


consume going either from, hope, humanely raised animal sources
maybe pure plant-based. Believe not, folks actually
susceptible low iodine turns diets meat rich don't
many vegetables, well diets vegetable rich don't many
meats salts risk lowering thyroid hormone way iodine pathway
pathways. let try simplify you. Chances people
all-meat diet, not sprinkling, not wrapping steaks
seaweed may may not supplementing iodine. Chances
probably consuming iodine salt requirements go not consuming
vegetables. People consuming vegetables kind interesting. always
hear cruciferous vegetables important
actually substances, compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables
can interfere thyroid hormone function. eating lot stuff, lot
cabbages just look other, think broccoli cruciferous vegetable,
won't read off whole list, just put internet. always told
eat lot dark, leafy green stuff. Well, unless dark, leafy green stuff kelp
seaweed, chances not getting enough iodine unless adding salt
food. chances may lowering total amount thyroid
making, well fact plant-rich diets, hard get enough L-tyrosine
don't want, know, not inflame vegans carnivore folks.
don't take stance either way that. just learning, trying report
science. point want make health important. purely plant-
based eating lot cruciferous vegetables, make sure getting
enough iodine. seem like cruciferous vegetables can increase need
iodine. thing purely all-meat diet keto,
not ingesting many vegetables. always thought cleaner diet,
better, turns probably true standpoint of, know, hormone
regulation, know, estrogen testosterone hormones. highly
processed foods really terrible. much evidence that. phthalates
plastics processed foods emulsifiers, stuff talked
previous episode, seem people not getting enough iodine
whatever reason, really need check whether not iodine levels need
increased fact consuming many plants many
meats cases, plants actually lower thyroid hormone. not beat


dead horse cabbage,

00:39:00 Benefits Iodine: Reducing Inflammation

number things iodine can positive sort of,
related thyroid, not directly, kind offshoots thyroid pathway
downstream it, say, terms impact metabolic function.
One reduce something called c-reactive protein. may
heard CRP c-reactive protein. C-reactive protein something want
keep modestly low levels. associated inflammation various forms heart
disease even eye disease, macular degeneration. appear iodine
supplementation getting sufficient iodine food, either works, associated
reduced levels c-reactive protein blood anti-inflammatory effect.
anti-inflammatory effect brings us back old friend, interleukin 6. Remember,
inflammatory cytokines. many, many names
many, many them. Interleukin 10 one anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6
one inflammatory. Anytime see IL-6, usually means
inflammatory response, wound, inflammation brain, somebody
either sleep deprived brain injury dealing sort infection.
IL-6 kind catch-all inflammation. appear iodine
supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated inflammation.
sense, iodine can anti-inflammatory effect. now, abundantly
clear. care thyroid hormone, care pathways impacts
like high level metabolism, guess no reason attractive
'cause can eat still maintain healthy body composition, also
brain health, cognitive function, tissue repair, stuff, keeping c-reactive protein low,
keeping IL-6 low, make sure getting enough iodine, selenium L-tyrosine.

00:41:00 & Increased Thyroid Increases Metabolism

curious thyroid actually increases metabolism, allows eat more,
et cetera. relates something covered last issue, glucose. Remember
eat something, blood sugar goes up, insulin secreted pancreas
makes sure blood glucose doesn't go high, can damage tissues


low, can make hypoglycemic. Thyroid increases glucose uptake various
tissues, particular muscle bone. actually can increase bone mineral density,
really good thing. get older, injuries, say older, mean basically
30 older, reason can recover quickly injuries
healthy thyroid healthy thyroid pathways can consume energy.
energy diverted toward bone repair muscle repair cartilage repair.
way increasing ATP. whole idea iodine,
selenium, L-tyrosine, allow thyroid healthy levels thyroid can take
glucose blood divert tissues used, particular brain.
things talking about, supplementing getting food,

00:42:12 Eat Support Brain

can actually improve support brain function. People always asking me,
food eat brain? Like, blueberries good brain?
ask me, walnuts good brain 'cause looks like brain? talked
earlier. fact matter need nutrients support hormones
biological pathways support brain. way think it. realized
people ask, eat support brain? basically
asking short form. keeping thyroid hormone healthy healthy levels is,
going terrific brain 75% metabolism brain.
ability brain use glucose ketones matter going aided
healthy thyroid. things, take things, eat things going
allow

00:43:00 Hyperthyroidism (Too Much) & Hypothyroidism (Too Little)

healthy levels thyroid hormone. sure number
wondering, healthy levels thyroid hormone? can measured
blood. telltale signs really high thyroid really low thyroid,
start listing off. easy find online well. Things like bulging
eyes, inability maintain weight, shaky, anxiety, kind hyperthyroidal, thinning
hair, kind thing. don't want get diagnosing hypothyroidism
hyperthyroidism. just impossible 'cause kind


shouting back forth tunnel video comments. concerned

00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work
parallel. lumped together episode. increase
metabolism repair growth tissues. conversation growth hormone
incomplete didn't talk kind extremes. certain
people born don't make enough growth hormone, end
short stature. certain people make ton growth hormone
end very, large. tend large appendages.

bone ridge. giant. used called giantism. people course
range height appendage length. doesn't imply growth
hormone disruption there. Growth hormone received lot attention
sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth
hormone. Today, going talk things anyone can increase
growth hormone. reasons certain people want that.
People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,

talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth

want emphasize, talk doctor anything, including remove
treatments. anything add take away, responsibility
healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly
tissue repair, et cetera, need get slow-wave sleep so-called deep
sleep need blood insulin glucose relatively low. eating within two
hours sleep,

00:54:49 Not Eating Within 2hrs Sleep: Keep Blood Glucose Low(ish) Sleep

excuse me, eating within two hours going sleep going suppress growth

trouble falling asleep. episodes sleep covered
episodes two, three, four Huberman Lab Podcast has, believe, tools
ever want make use terms optimize sleep.
can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter

logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions

hear thyroid growth hormone, want realize repeating
logic.

00:17:33 Releasing Hormones Brain, Stimulating Hormones
Pituitary

First all, neurons brain area called hypothalamus,
just means thalamus, hypo. sits base brain, front,
part forebrain. less roof mouth, maybe
centimeter so, centimeter forward people. neurons
hypothalamus release hormones called releasing hormones.
talked previous episodes about, instance, gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
little neurons signal another brain area called pituitary
release hormones. Today, going see again. brain,
neurons release thyrotropin thyroid-releasing hormone. also growth
hormone-releasing hormone. anytime hear releasing, chances
neurons brain extend little wires call axons
pituitary pituitary releases bunch hormones bloodstream.
pituitary releases things often name stimulating hormone
stimulate organs. keeping theme thyroid hormone,
thyroid-releasing hormone brain, tells pituitary release thyroid-stimulating
hormone thyroid, talk moment, releases thyroid
hormones. testosterone estrogen episode, talked
gonadotropin-releasing hormone, releasing again, brain.
Remember, releasing hormone comes brain. things like
luteinizing hormone follicle-stimulating hormone, pituitary
traveled ovaries testes acted tissues, okay? please
try embed logic. hear word releasing hormone, coming
brain, makes actionable certain ways return later. addition,
pituitary letting go hormones bloodstream stimulating
different tissues. thyroid, thyroid-stimulating hormone. goes


thyroid. thyroid little butterfly-shaped gland right around Adam's
apple. want see yours, not directly 'cause got skin it,
take sip water, look mirror swallow. thing
moves down, thyroid. Now, people call Adam's apple
sits right near protrusion trachea, Adam's apple. No
matter, whether not male, female, regardless chromosomal
background is, everyone Adam's apple. tends pronounced people
got surge testosterone early development testosterone
sensitivity it. actually controls timbre, so-called deepness voice.
thyroid gland sits right got four little bumps behind called
parathyroid gland. releases two hormones blood stimulate different
tissues metabolism. hormones called T4 T3.
already sounding like lot information, really easy, promise. Releasing hormone
comes brain. Stimulating hormone comes pituitary. case,
talking thyroid, binding stimulating hormone saying, oh,
need release something. releases T4 T3. guess what? can
basically forget T4. T4, not completely inactive, roles,

00:21:04 Thyroid Hormone’s Real Effects: Growth, Repair Energy Consumption
Tissues

T3 one less active. Now, thyroid hormone do? lot
people think, oh, thyroid, like metabolism people hyperthyroidal
bulging eyes real thin people hypothyroid overweight
eyes like are, know, half closed something. indeed thyroid hormone
controls lot features face eyes. can control amounts
adipose tissue forth. main role thyroid hormone, T3, promote
metabolism. doesn't just mean consumption energy, means
utilization energy, including buildup tissues. acts sorts target
tissues body. acts muscle, acts liver, acts cartilage, acts
bone. not just involved using energy, also converting energy.
realize said twice. involved taking fats breaking fatty

also involved taking sugars turning energy. yes, goes

thyroid associated less lean bodies. one thing absolutely key
actionable,

00:22:45 Iodine, L-Tyrosine & Selenium: Trio Essential Thyroid Function

right already discussing tools iodine. Iodine comes things
ocean, right? couple interesting facts iodine. talk
whether not supplementing iodine not. First all, iodine
common sea salt, kelp seaweed. people can get enough
iodine food eat and/or table salt consume. Almost table salt
world, regardless are, contains iodine. thyroid needs
iodine order produce thyroid hormone. need sufficient levels thyroid
hormone, not much, need it. chances getting enough iodine.
Although, might not, especially following particularly, quote, unquote,
clean diet, might not getting enough iodine. deal iodine. Iodine
combines amino acid talked called L-tyrosine. L-tyrosine
comes meat, nuts. plant-based sources well.
precursor dopamine. thyroid, iodine combines works L-tyrosine
produce T3 T4, thyroid hormone. absolutely need sufficient iodine,
need sufficient L-tyrosine, also need something else, called
selenium. talk selenium moment. condition shows
little pockets world. not super common, meaning not widespread,
certain areas far away ocean, one point, historically
Midwestern states United States, mountain regions countries,
areas Africa far ocean, people get extremely
swollen bulges necks. called goiter. reason
getting swollen bulges thyroid hypertrophying.
growing attempt churn thyroid. getting lot
stimulating hormone pituitary. don't want go far off track
recall, brain pituitary paying attention cellular sense levels
hormones blood. hormones get high, shut off


stimulating hormone, shut signal make more, kind like thermostat.
levels low, like not enough testosterone bloodstream
not enough estrogen, brain will continue push signal make more.
Similarly, not enough thyroid circulating not enough iodine make
thyroid, therefore not enough thyroid hormone circulating, thyroid gland not
getting shut down. tons stimulating hormone releasing hormone coming
brain, like release, release, release, no way can make thyroid
hormone gland just gets bigger bigger bigger. people get
goiter. one reasons table salt iodine it. Although
foods iodine well. much iodine need?

00:26:05 Much Iodine Need? Food, Supplement Ocean Air

Well, don't need whole lot. people hypothyroidal might, want
emphasize might, absolutely talk doctor. serious matter.
Anytime talking hormones manipulating levels thyroid, absolutely
want talk doctor. people benefit supplementing iodine.
contained salts. Himalayan salt, not always, often. know days,
lot excitement pink salts sea salts what, know,
kind artisan salt thing kind taken off foodie land, great.
actually quite tasty. can just take directly like taste salt.
iodine can supplemented things like kelp seaweed kelp tablets.
Now, hyperthyroidal, make much thyroid, actually can
problem. really, best way figure get blood levels tested
thyroid hormone. much iodine ocean believe not people
live near coast can actually just absorb air, just breathing ocean
air. gives sense just little iodine actually need consume
food salt. within miles ocean visit ocean
time time, probably getting plenty. come together,
mentioned, L-tyrosine, foods contain L-tyrosine, provided
sufficient iodine diet, sufficient selenium
diet, serve increase metabolism. growth repair
tissues. really important. not just keeping metabolism high
can leaner side things adjust body weight, excuse me,


body composition ratios way like. Repair injuries, repair brain tissue,
clearance damage neurons, clearance damage body also
going depend thyroid. Again, metabolism kind rate fuel
consumption use body, generally,

00:28:09 Selenium Thyroid: Brazil Nuts & Valuable Sources

not just body mass indexes things sort. talk selenium
really important. even though people getting lot sufficient
iodine, people probably getting enough L-tyrosine. guessing
people may not getting enough selenium goal increase thyroid hormone,
least literature says. Without going biochemistry, selenium
important order thyroid hormone made way allows L-
tyrosine iodine interact. thing people aren't getting enough
selenium don't eat foods high selenium. Now, much
selenium need will depend live. actually varies country country.
countries found say get 100 micrograms, say 200,
say 155. average 155 micrograms, countries looked at. People
trying increase thyroid levels might want consume selenium.
consume vitamin, course, want make sure selenium not
overdoing consuming lot selenium rich foods either. nonetheless, think
fair say people probably well ingesting slightly selenium
currently are. Although, course, always talk doctor. Brazil nuts
heavyweight champion foods get selenium from. high concentrations
selenium. just six eight Brazil nuts contain something like 550 micrograms
selenium. also present fish. certain fish like yellowfin tuna, although nowadays
whenever mention tuna shellfish, rich source selenium, people
will tell immediately sorts issues around farm, not farm, mercury, et
cetera. never particularly liked eating fish 'cause way tastes.
avoid it. like it, sure much skilled
knowing fish buy fish not buy. Ham, things, contains lot
selenium, whatever reason pork does. not big consumer pork. Beef
selenium, interesting look sources, know, pork, beef, turkey,
chicken, cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice, want understand Brazil


nuts, six eight Brazil nuts 550 micrograms selenium. foods
mentioned much greater portion size equivalent six eight Brazil nuts, either
volume calories, something like 30 50 micrograms selenium.
not eating Brazil nuts, guessing people aren't, not eating
lot animal based foods, know many aren't, probably not
getting enough selenium. again, can levels measured can
just check consuming figure whether not meeting ration
need order get healthy levels thyroid. present things like
mushrooms, again, bowl mushrooms, know, equivalent
bowl mushroom 12 micrograms selenium. daily ration something
100 200 range, again, look area are. can see really quickly
even though things like mushrooms spinach milk yogurt lentils
cashews, now vegetarian segment list constructed,
probably not getting enough selenium. kind interesting thing.
experimenter get clearance doctor, try increasing
selenium levels see impacts metabolism. Again, Brazil nuts
probably going direct way get sufficient selenium levels
levels high Brazil nuts, also means overdo well. not
really aware consequences getting much selenium, although
can get much anything guessing consequences aren't good. also
want mention children, daily requirements selenium much lower,
low 30 40 micrograms kids 14 years younger. areas, really
want underscore this, amount selenium recommended daily low
55 micrograms. not shooting thousands even high levels
hundreds micrograms selenium. again, micrograms, not milligrams.
again, look need somebody interested keeping
thyroid function healthy productive, certainly want make sure
getting enough iodine, getting enough selenium getting enough L-
tyrosine. interesting start looking various foods, especially highly
processed foods, start realize

00:33:05 Selenium Pregnancy, Prostate Cancer Risk, Acne

perhaps many people, maybe you, not. Not incidentally, selenium


effects health can quite positive. even though don't relate
thyroid growth hormone function specifically, think might want know
them, given topic selenium. first three studies,
showed high efficacy reducing risk something called
preeclampsia, excuse me, preeclampsia. Preeclampsia seizures related
blood pressure issues around delivery new baby. actually,
rare-ish condition actually can quite deadly. fact selenium
important offsetting preeclampsia risk interesting. don't know exact
mechanism guessing either
pregnant thinking conceiving soon, worth noting. Obviously, anything
related pregnancy lactation, especially talk doctor. guessing
selenium probably lot prenatal formulas one clear benefit
sufficient selenium. reduced prostate cancer risk. study showing
sufficient selenium can reduce prostate cancer risk.
evidence consume foods areas soil low selenium, can
problem. last episode, talked issues related soil quality,
things making way food disrupting hormones forth.
sufficient selenium food offset low content soil.
apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk. minor effect statistically
significant one. one reduction acne, interesting.
guessing probably thyroid hormone pathway
way thyroid hormone can impact liver. turns liver various
biochemical reactions liver can impact acne. probably episode
just additional benefits getting sufficient selenium.

00:35:20 “Clean Eating” Downsides: Cruciferous Vegetables, Leeching Iodine

Okay, already deep tools related making sure sufficient
selenium, iodine, L-tyrosine order make enough thyroid hormones can
support metabolic processes liver, muscles, tendons, whatever
purpose, keeping metabolism high, body composition reasons healing,
keeping brain working well. Earlier mentioned, people following
clean diets. people consume no processed foods. know,
starch might eat going maybe rice grain protein might


consume going either from, hope, humanely raised animal sources
maybe pure plant-based. Believe not, folks actually
susceptible low iodine turns diets meat rich don't
many vegetables, well diets vegetable rich don't many
meats salts risk lowering thyroid hormone way iodine pathway
pathways. let try simplify you. Chances people
all-meat diet, not sprinkling, not wrapping steaks
seaweed may may not supplementing iodine. Chances
probably consuming iodine salt requirements go not consuming
vegetables. People consuming vegetables kind interesting. always
hear cruciferous vegetables important
actually substances, compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables
can interfere thyroid hormone function. eating lot stuff, lot
cabbages just look other, think broccoli cruciferous vegetable,
won't read off whole list, just put internet. always told
eat lot dark, leafy green stuff. Well, unless dark, leafy green stuff kelp
seaweed, chances not getting enough iodine unless adding salt
food. chances may lowering total amount thyroid
making, well fact plant-rich diets, hard get enough L-tyrosine
don't want, know, not inflame vegans carnivore folks.
don't take stance either way that. just learning, trying report
science. point want make health important. purely plant-
based eating lot cruciferous vegetables, make sure getting
enough iodine. seem like cruciferous vegetables can increase need
iodine. thing purely all-meat diet keto,
not ingesting many vegetables. always thought cleaner diet,
better, turns probably true standpoint of, know, hormone
regulation, know, estrogen testosterone hormones. highly
processed foods really terrible. much evidence that. phthalates
plastics processed foods emulsifiers, stuff talked
previous episode, seem people not getting enough iodine
whatever reason, really need check whether not iodine levels need
increased fact consuming many plants many
meats cases, plants actually lower thyroid hormone. not beat


dead horse cabbage,

00:39:00 Benefits Iodine: Reducing Inflammation

number things iodine can positive sort of,
related thyroid, not directly, kind offshoots thyroid pathway
downstream it, say, terms impact metabolic function.
One reduce something called c-reactive protein. may
heard CRP c-reactive protein. C-reactive protein something want
keep modestly low levels. associated inflammation various forms heart
disease even eye disease, macular degeneration. appear iodine
supplementation getting sufficient iodine food, either works, associated
reduced levels c-reactive protein blood anti-inflammatory effect.
anti-inflammatory effect brings us back old friend, interleukin 6. Remember,
inflammatory cytokines. many, many names
many, many them. Interleukin 10 one anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6
one inflammatory. Anytime see IL-6, usually means
inflammatory response, wound, inflammation brain, somebody
either sleep deprived brain injury dealing sort infection.
IL-6 kind catch-all inflammation. appear iodine
supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated inflammation.
sense, iodine can anti-inflammatory effect. now, abundantly
clear. care thyroid hormone, care pathways impacts
like high level metabolism, guess no reason attractive
'cause can eat still maintain healthy body composition, also
brain health, cognitive function, tissue repair, stuff, keeping c-reactive protein low,
keeping IL-6 low, make sure getting enough iodine, selenium L-tyrosine.

00:41:00 & Increased Thyroid Increases Metabolism

curious thyroid actually increases metabolism, allows eat more,
et cetera. relates something covered last issue, glucose. Remember
eat something, blood sugar goes up, insulin secreted pancreas
makes sure blood glucose doesn't go high, can damage tissues


low, can make hypoglycemic. Thyroid increases glucose uptake various
tissues, particular muscle bone. actually can increase bone mineral density,
really good thing. get older, injuries, say older, mean basically
30 older, reason can recover quickly injuries
healthy thyroid healthy thyroid pathways can consume energy.
energy diverted toward bone repair muscle repair cartilage repair.
way increasing ATP. whole idea iodine,
selenium, L-tyrosine, allow thyroid healthy levels thyroid can take
glucose blood divert tissues used, particular brain.
things talking about, supplementing getting food,

00:42:12 Eat Support Brain

can actually improve support brain function. People always asking me,
food eat brain? Like, blueberries good brain?
ask me, walnuts good brain 'cause looks like brain? talked
earlier. fact matter need nutrients support hormones
biological pathways support brain. way think it. realized
people ask, eat support brain? basically
asking short form. keeping thyroid hormone healthy healthy levels is,
going terrific brain 75% metabolism brain.
ability brain use glucose ketones matter going aided
healthy thyroid. things, take things, eat things going
allow

00:43:00 Hyperthyroidism (Too Much) & Hypothyroidism (Too Little)

hyperthyroidism. just impossible 'cause kind


shouting back forth tunnel video comments. concerned
excessively high excessively low levels thyroid hormone, absolutely
look symptoms are. Talk physician. number good

00:44:35 Menstruation: Thyroid Carbohydrate & Sugar Craving

diet supplementation. also lot evidence people
menstruate, levels thyroid hormone can fluctuate dramatically across menstrual
cycle. really going process experimentation. don't know
could, could, theory, take blood different phases cycle figure
whether not thyroid hormone excessively high low different phases
cycle. going pretty tough do. endocrinologist
willing you, terrific. think people going figure
supplementing sorts things talked before, getting foods
relates different aspects cycle. general, first half cycle
ovulation, people crave carbohydrates sweets makes total sense
based biology menstrual cycle. Thyroid hormone going go you,
anyone, male female, menstruating not,

00:45:33 Ketogenic Diet & Effects Thyroid, Rebound Weight Gain

increases starchy carbohydrates. interesting ketogenic diets
shown slightly lower thyroid levels. makes sense ketogenic
diets, blood glucose levels low. thyroid hormone secreted large part
proportion much glucose bloodstream much glucose,


excuse me, needs regulated. not trying demonize ketogenic diet.
think definitely place. 22 studies now showing can dramatically
reduce blood glucose. third show thyroid hormone levels
slightly reduced, sometimes significantly, not more, ketogenic diet may
explain, want highlight may explain fact people go back
traditional diet ketogenic diet long time, oftentimes will
gain weight quickly bring carbohydrates back diet. people
cycling ketogenic non-ketogenic every three, four days. So-called
cyclical ketogenic diet. people staying ketogenic long periods time.
people six days on, one day off. huge variation there. point
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates particular, support healthy production
T3 T4. low carbohydrate, going reduction
T3 T4. going bring carbohydrates back diet,
might want gradually. menstruate, craving
carbohydrates early part cycle, actually associated
healthy cycle. healthy cycle ketogenic diet,
interesting. Maybe let know comments point direction
research aware it. can start see, really
beautiful interplay different hormones, insulin glucose,
estrogen thyroid, thyroid blood glucose ketogenic

kind core elements hormones variety tissues
work on. simple version haven't carbohydrate year,
T3, T4 levels going pretty low. sure ketonistas
there. going say, wait, no, thyroid hormone levels go keto. might
true reasons, indirect reasons related hormone pathways

00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work
parallel. lumped together episode. increase
metabolism repair growth tissues. conversation growth hormone
incomplete didn't talk kind extremes. certain
people born don't make enough growth hormone, end
short stature. certain people make ton growth hormone
end very, large. tend large appendages.
something called acromegaly. kind like ridging forehead. actually
bone ridge. giant. used called giantism. people course
range height appendage length. doesn't imply growth
hormone disruption there. Growth hormone received lot attention
sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth
hormone. Today, going talk things anyone can increase
growth hormone. reasons certain people want that.
People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,


unquote, levels growth hormone might want

00:51:18 Growth Hormone (GH) Changes Across Lifespan & Risks GH Therapy

age puberty development, pituitary churning tons
growth hormone. responsible growth, not surprising, body
features. Height, just one those. age, make less growth
hormone. one reasons recover slowly injuries.
one reasons accumulate body fat. one reasons
metabolism slows. growth hormone replacement therapy tremendously
popular last 20 years, not say doesn't carry problems, does.
one major problems injecting growth hormone. Not saying people
shouldn't doctor approved keeping particular life
goals, growth hormone, levels high, will cause growth
tissues. not just muscle, not just reduction body fat metabolizing, know,
allowing fatty acids pulled storage used ATP, will also cause
increase growth heart lungs liver spleen.
concern abuse growth hormone. not going talking abuse
growth hormone. will, however, talk tools anyone can use increase
levels growth hormone. behavioral, supplement-
based interact behaviors supplements. cool
discussion growth hormone tools exist
increase growth hormone actionable. people can without
need equipment even supplement. Although supplement
related themes tools growth hormone increase. also increases one
can get growth hormone substantial. normally, talk
difference taking something exogenous substance like testosterone
estrogen versus using supplements behaviors increase them, talking
tenfold differences from, know, administering prescription compound. terms
growth hormone, things can increase growth hormone three, four, 500%
more. even though short-lived increase, can powerful effects
metabolism repair tissues.

00:53:40 Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know Natural TriggerS



talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth
hormone, chances things going benefit you. However, always,
want emphasize, talk doctor anything, including remove
treatments. anything add take away, responsibility
healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly
tissue repair, et cetera, need get slow-wave sleep so-called deep
sleep need blood insulin glucose relatively low. eating within two
hours sleep,

00:54:49 Not Eating Within 2hrs Sleep: Keep Blood Glucose Low(ish) Sleep

excuse me, eating within two hours going sleep going suppress growth
hormone release. clear. However, people going problems
falling asleep hungry. work decide
going eat. going eat thing not hungry
trouble falling asleep. episodes sleep covered
episodes two, three, four Huberman Lab Podcast has, believe, tools
ever want make use terms optimize sleep.
can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional
conversation. brain telling body hormones make. hormones
influencing tissues body also telling brain

thyroid. thyroid little butterfly-shaped gland right around Adam's
apple. want see yours, not directly 'cause got skin it,
take sip water, look mirror swallow. thing
moves down, thyroid. Now, people call Adam's apple
sits right near protrusion trachea, Adam's apple. No
matter, whether not male, female, regardless chromosomal
background is, everyone Adam's apple. tends pronounced people
got surge testosterone early development testosterone
sensitivity it. actually controls timbre, so-called deepness voice.
thyroid gland sits right got four little bumps behind called
parathyroid gland. releases two hormones blood stimulate different
tissues metabolism. hormones called T4 T3.
already sounding like lot information, really easy, promise. Releasing hormone
comes brain. Stimulating hormone comes pituitary. case,
talking thyroid, binding stimulating hormone saying, oh,
need release something. releases T4 T3. guess what? can
basically forget T4. T4, not completely inactive, roles,

00:21:04 Thyroid Hormone’s Real Effects: Growth, Repair Energy Consumption
Tissues

T3 one less active. Now, thyroid hormone do? lot
people think, oh, thyroid, like metabolism people hyperthyroidal
bulging eyes real thin people hypothyroid overweight
eyes like are, know, half closed something. indeed thyroid hormone
controls lot features face eyes. can control amounts
adipose tissue forth. main role thyroid hormone, T3, promote
metabolism. doesn't just mean consumption energy, means
utilization energy, including buildup tissues. acts sorts target
tissues body. acts muscle, acts liver, acts cartilage, acts
bone. not just involved using energy, also converting energy.
realize said twice. involved taking fats breaking fatty
acids converting ATP, important thing cells use energy.
also involved taking sugars turning energy. yes, goes


adipose tissue fat. different kinds fat talk today goes
white fat liberates helps liberate fats fat cells use
energy. higher thyroid associated leaner bodies. Lower
thyroid associated less lean bodies. one thing absolutely key
actionable,

00:22:45 Iodine, L-Tyrosine & Selenium: Trio Essential Thyroid Function

right already discussing tools iodine. Iodine comes things
ocean, right? couple interesting facts iodine. talk
whether not supplementing iodine not. First all, iodine
common sea salt, kelp seaweed. people can get enough
iodine food eat and/or table salt consume. Almost table salt
world, regardless are, contains iodine. thyroid needs
iodine order produce thyroid hormone. need sufficient levels thyroid
hormone, not much, need it. chances getting enough iodine.
Although, might not, especially following particularly, quote, unquote,
clean diet, might not getting enough iodine. deal iodine. Iodine
combines amino acid talked called L-tyrosine. L-tyrosine
comes meat, nuts. plant-based sources well.
precursor dopamine. thyroid, iodine combines works L-tyrosine
produce T3 T4, thyroid hormone. absolutely need sufficient iodine,
need sufficient L-tyrosine, also need something else, called
selenium. talk selenium moment. condition shows
little pockets world. not super common, meaning not widespread,
certain areas far away ocean, one point, historically
Midwestern states United States, mountain regions countries,
areas Africa far ocean, people get extremely
swollen bulges necks. called goiter. reason
getting swollen bulges thyroid hypertrophying.
growing attempt churn thyroid. getting lot
stimulating hormone pituitary. don't want go far off track
recall, brain pituitary paying attention cellular sense levels
hormones blood. hormones get high, shut off


stimulating hormone, shut signal make more, kind like thermostat.
levels low, like not enough testosterone bloodstream
not enough estrogen, brain will continue push signal make more.
Similarly, not enough thyroid circulating not enough iodine make
thyroid, therefore not enough thyroid hormone circulating, thyroid gland not
getting shut down. tons stimulating hormone releasing hormone coming
brain, like release, release, release, no way can make thyroid
hormone gland just gets bigger bigger bigger. people get
goiter. one reasons table salt iodine it. Although
foods iodine well. much iodine need?

00:26:05 Much Iodine Need? Food, Supplement Ocean Air

Well, don't need whole lot. people hypothyroidal might, want
emphasize might, absolutely talk doctor. serious matter.
Anytime talking hormones manipulating levels thyroid, absolutely
want talk doctor. people benefit supplementing iodine.
contained salts. Himalayan salt, not always, often. know days,
lot excitement pink salts sea salts what, know,
kind artisan salt thing kind taken off foodie land, great.
actually quite tasty. can just take directly like taste salt.
iodine can supplemented things like kelp seaweed kelp tablets.
Now, hyperthyroidal, make much thyroid, actually can
problem. really, best way figure get blood levels tested
thyroid hormone. much iodine ocean believe not people
live near coast can actually just absorb air, just breathing ocean
air. gives sense just little iodine actually need consume
food salt. within miles ocean visit ocean
time time, probably getting plenty. come together,
mentioned, L-tyrosine, foods contain L-tyrosine, provided
sufficient iodine diet, sufficient selenium
diet, serve increase metabolism. growth repair
tissues. really important. not just keeping metabolism high
can leaner side things adjust body weight, excuse me,


body composition ratios way like. Repair injuries, repair brain tissue,
clearance damage neurons, clearance damage body also
going depend thyroid. Again, metabolism kind rate fuel
consumption use body, generally,

00:28:09 Selenium Thyroid: Brazil Nuts & Valuable Sources

not just body mass indexes things sort. talk selenium
really important. even though people getting lot sufficient
iodine, people probably getting enough L-tyrosine. guessing
people may not getting enough selenium goal increase thyroid hormone,
least literature says. Without going biochemistry, selenium
important order thyroid hormone made way allows L-
tyrosine iodine interact. thing people aren't getting enough
selenium don't eat foods high selenium. Now, much
selenium need will depend live. actually varies country country.
countries found say get 100 micrograms, say 200,
say 155. average 155 micrograms, countries looked at. People
trying increase thyroid levels might want consume selenium.
consume vitamin, course, want make sure selenium not
overdoing consuming lot selenium rich foods either. nonetheless, think
fair say people probably well ingesting slightly selenium
currently are. Although, course, always talk doctor. Brazil nuts
heavyweight champion foods get selenium from. high concentrations
selenium. just six eight Brazil nuts contain something like 550 micrograms
selenium. also present fish. certain fish like yellowfin tuna, although nowadays
whenever mention tuna shellfish, rich source selenium, people
will tell immediately sorts issues around farm, not farm, mercury, et
cetera. never particularly liked eating fish 'cause way tastes.
avoid it. like it, sure much skilled
knowing fish buy fish not buy. Ham, things, contains lot
selenium, whatever reason pork does. not big consumer pork. Beef
selenium, interesting look sources, know, pork, beef, turkey,
chicken, cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice, want understand Brazil


nuts, six eight Brazil nuts 550 micrograms selenium. foods
mentioned much greater portion size equivalent six eight Brazil nuts, either
volume calories, something like 30 50 micrograms selenium.
not eating Brazil nuts, guessing people aren't, not eating
lot animal based foods, know many aren't, probably not
getting enough selenium. again, can levels measured can
just check consuming figure whether not meeting ration
need order get healthy levels thyroid. present things like
mushrooms, again, bowl mushrooms, know, equivalent
bowl mushroom 12 micrograms selenium. daily ration something
100 200 range, again, look area are. can see really quickly
even though things like mushrooms spinach milk yogurt lentils
cashews, now vegetarian segment list constructed,
probably not getting enough selenium. kind interesting thing.
experimenter get clearance doctor, try increasing
selenium levels see impacts metabolism. Again, Brazil nuts
probably going direct way get sufficient selenium levels
levels high Brazil nuts, also means overdo well. not
really aware consequences getting much selenium, although
can get much anything guessing consequences aren't good. also
want mention children, daily requirements selenium much lower,
low 30 40 micrograms kids 14 years younger. areas, really
want underscore this, amount selenium recommended daily low
55 micrograms. not shooting thousands even high levels
hundreds micrograms selenium. again, micrograms, not milligrams.
again, look need somebody interested keeping
thyroid function healthy productive, certainly want make sure
getting enough iodine, getting enough selenium getting enough L-
tyrosine. interesting start looking various foods, especially highly
processed foods, start realize

00:33:05 Selenium Pregnancy, Prostate Cancer Risk, Acne

perhaps many people, maybe you, not. Not incidentally, selenium


effects health can quite positive. even though don't relate
thyroid growth hormone function specifically, think might want know
them, given topic selenium. first three studies,
showed high efficacy reducing risk something called
preeclampsia, excuse me, preeclampsia. Preeclampsia seizures related
blood pressure issues around delivery new baby. actually,
rare-ish condition actually can quite deadly. fact selenium
important offsetting preeclampsia risk interesting. don't know exact
mechanism guessing either
pregnant thinking conceiving soon, worth noting. Obviously, anything
related pregnancy lactation, especially talk doctor. guessing
selenium probably lot prenatal formulas one clear benefit
sufficient selenium. reduced prostate cancer risk. study showing
sufficient selenium can reduce prostate cancer risk.
evidence consume foods areas soil low selenium, can
problem. last episode, talked issues related soil quality,
things making way food disrupting hormones forth.
sufficient selenium food offset low content soil.
apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk. minor effect statistically
significant one. one reduction acne, interesting.
guessing probably thyroid hormone pathway
way thyroid hormone can impact liver. turns liver various
biochemical reactions liver can impact acne. probably episode
just additional benefits getting sufficient selenium.

00:35:20 “Clean Eating” Downsides: Cruciferous Vegetables, Leeching Iodine

Okay, already deep tools related making sure sufficient
selenium, iodine, L-tyrosine order make enough thyroid hormones can
support metabolic processes liver, muscles, tendons, whatever
purpose, keeping metabolism high, body composition reasons healing,
keeping brain working well. Earlier mentioned, people following
clean diets. people consume no processed foods. know,
starch might eat going maybe rice grain protein might


consume going either from, hope, humanely raised animal sources
maybe pure plant-based. Believe not, folks actually
susceptible low iodine turns diets meat rich don't
many vegetables, well diets vegetable rich don't many
meats salts risk lowering thyroid hormone way iodine pathway
pathways. let try simplify you. Chances people
all-meat diet, not sprinkling, not wrapping steaks
seaweed may may not supplementing iodine. Chances
probably consuming iodine salt requirements go not consuming
vegetables. People consuming vegetables kind interesting. always
hear cruciferous vegetables important
actually substances, compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables
can interfere thyroid hormone function. eating lot stuff, lot
cabbages just look other, think broccoli cruciferous vegetable,
won't read off whole list, just put internet. always told
eat lot dark, leafy green stuff. Well, unless dark, leafy green stuff kelp
seaweed, chances not getting enough iodine unless adding salt
food. chances may lowering total amount thyroid
making, well fact plant-rich diets, hard get enough L-tyrosine
don't want, know, not inflame vegans carnivore folks.
don't take stance either way that. just learning, trying report
science. point want make health important. purely plant-
based eating lot cruciferous vegetables, make sure getting
enough iodine. seem like cruciferous vegetables can increase need
iodine. thing purely all-meat diet keto,
not ingesting many vegetables. always thought cleaner diet,
better, turns probably true standpoint of, know, hormone
regulation, know, estrogen testosterone hormones. highly
processed foods really terrible. much evidence that. phthalates
plastics processed foods emulsifiers, stuff talked
previous episode, seem people not getting enough iodine
whatever reason, really need check whether not iodine levels need
increased fact consuming many plants many
meats cases, plants actually lower thyroid hormone. not beat


dead horse cabbage,

00:39:00 Benefits Iodine: Reducing Inflammation

number things iodine can positive sort of,
related thyroid, not directly, kind offshoots thyroid pathway
downstream it, say, terms impact metabolic function.
One reduce something called c-reactive protein. may
heard CRP c-reactive protein. C-reactive protein something want
keep modestly low levels. associated inflammation various forms heart
disease even eye disease, macular degeneration. appear iodine
supplementation getting sufficient iodine food, either works, associated
reduced levels c-reactive protein blood anti-inflammatory effect.
anti-inflammatory effect brings us back old friend, interleukin 6. Remember,
inflammatory cytokines. many, many names
many, many them. Interleukin 10 one anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6
one inflammatory. Anytime see IL-6, usually means
inflammatory response, wound, inflammation brain, somebody
either sleep deprived brain injury dealing sort infection.
IL-6 kind catch-all inflammation. appear iodine
supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated inflammation.
sense, iodine can anti-inflammatory effect. now, abundantly
clear. care thyroid hormone, care pathways impacts
like high level metabolism, guess no reason attractive
'cause can eat still maintain healthy body composition, also
brain health, cognitive function, tissue repair, stuff, keeping c-reactive protein low,
keeping IL-6 low, make sure getting enough iodine, selenium L-tyrosine.

00:41:00 & Increased Thyroid Increases Metabolism

curious thyroid actually increases metabolism, allows eat more,
et cetera. relates something covered last issue, glucose. Remember
eat something, blood sugar goes up, insulin secreted pancreas
makes sure blood glucose doesn't go high, can damage tissues


low, can make hypoglycemic. Thyroid increases glucose uptake various
tissues, particular muscle bone. actually can increase bone mineral density,
really good thing. get older, injuries, say older, mean basically
30 older, reason can recover quickly injuries
healthy thyroid healthy thyroid pathways can consume energy.

00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work

People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,

00:53:40 Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know Natural TriggerS



talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth

healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly

can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid

can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional

00:22:45 Iodine, L-Tyrosine & Selenium: Trio Essential Thyroid Function

right already discussing tools iodine. Iodine comes things
ocean, right? couple interesting facts iodine. talk
whether not supplementing iodine not. First all, iodine
common sea salt, kelp seaweed. people can get enough
iodine food eat and/or table salt consume. Almost table salt
world, regardless are, contains iodine. thyroid needs
iodine order produce thyroid hormone. need sufficient levels thyroid
hormone, not much, need it. chances getting enough iodine.
Although, might not, especially following particularly, quote, unquote,
clean diet, might not getting enough iodine. deal iodine. Iodine
combines amino acid talked called L-tyrosine. L-tyrosine
comes meat, nuts. plant-based sources well.
precursor dopamine. thyroid, iodine combines works L-tyrosine
produce T3 T4, thyroid hormone. absolutely need sufficient iodine,
need sufficient L-tyrosine, also need something else, called
selenium. talk selenium moment. condition shows
little pockets world. not super common, meaning not widespread,
certain areas far away ocean, one point, historically
Midwestern states United States, mountain regions countries,
areas Africa far ocean, people get extremely
swollen bulges necks. called goiter. reason
getting swollen bulges thyroid hypertrophying.
growing attempt churn thyroid. getting lot
stimulating hormone pituitary. don't want go far off track
recall, brain pituitary paying attention cellular sense levels
hormones blood. hormones get high, shut off


stimulating hormone, shut signal make more, kind like thermostat.
levels low, like not enough testosterone bloodstream
not enough estrogen, brain will continue push signal make more.
Similarly, not enough thyroid circulating not enough iodine make
thyroid, therefore not enough thyroid hormone circulating, thyroid gland not
getting shut down. tons stimulating hormone releasing hormone coming
brain, like release, release, release, no way can make thyroid
hormone gland just gets bigger bigger bigger. people get
goiter. one reasons table salt iodine it. Although
foods iodine well. much iodine need?

00:26:05 Much Iodine Need? Food, Supplement Ocean Air

Well, don't need whole lot. people hypothyroidal might, want
emphasize might, absolutely talk doctor. serious matter.
Anytime talking hormones manipulating levels thyroid, absolutely
want talk doctor. people benefit supplementing iodine.
contained salts. Himalayan salt, not always, often. know days,
lot excitement pink salts sea salts what, know,
kind artisan salt thing kind taken off foodie land, great.
actually quite tasty. can just take directly like taste salt.
iodine can supplemented things like kelp seaweed kelp tablets.
Now, hyperthyroidal, make much thyroid, actually can
problem. really, best way figure get blood levels tested
thyroid hormone. much iodine ocean believe not people
live near coast can actually just absorb air, just breathing ocean
air. gives sense just little iodine actually need consume
food salt. within miles ocean visit ocean
time time, probably getting plenty. come together,
mentioned, L-tyrosine, foods contain L-tyrosine, provided
sufficient iodine diet, sufficient selenium
diet, serve increase metabolism. growth repair
tissues. really important. not just keeping metabolism high
can leaner side things adjust body weight, excuse me,


body composition ratios way like. Repair injuries, repair brain tissue,
clearance damage neurons, clearance damage body also
going depend thyroid. Again, metabolism kind rate fuel
consumption use body, generally,

00:28:09 Selenium Thyroid: Brazil Nuts & Valuable Sources

not just body mass indexes things sort. talk selenium
really important. even though people getting lot sufficient
iodine, people probably getting enough L-tyrosine. guessing
people may not getting enough selenium goal increase thyroid hormone,
least literature says. Without going biochemistry, selenium
important order thyroid hormone made way allows L-
tyrosine iodine interact. thing people aren't getting enough
selenium don't eat foods high selenium. Now, much
selenium need will depend live. actually varies country country.
countries found say get 100 micrograms, say 200,
say 155. average 155 micrograms, countries looked at. People
trying increase thyroid levels might want consume selenium.
consume vitamin, course, want make sure selenium not
overdoing consuming lot selenium rich foods either. nonetheless, think
fair say people probably well ingesting slightly selenium
currently are. Although, course, always talk doctor. Brazil nuts
heavyweight champion foods get selenium from. high concentrations
selenium. just six eight Brazil nuts contain something like 550 micrograms
selenium. also present fish. certain fish like yellowfin tuna, although nowadays
whenever mention tuna shellfish, rich source selenium, people
will tell immediately sorts issues around farm, not farm, mercury, et
cetera. never particularly liked eating fish 'cause way tastes.
avoid it. like it, sure much skilled
knowing fish buy fish not buy. Ham, things, contains lot
selenium, whatever reason pork does. not big consumer pork. Beef
selenium, interesting look sources, know, pork, beef, turkey,
chicken, cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice, want understand Brazil


nuts, six eight Brazil nuts 550 micrograms selenium. foods
mentioned much greater portion size equivalent six eight Brazil nuts, either
volume calories, something like 30 50 micrograms selenium.
not eating Brazil nuts, guessing people aren't, not eating
lot animal based foods, know many aren't, probably not
getting enough selenium. again, can levels measured can
just check consuming figure whether not meeting ration
need order get healthy levels thyroid. present things like
mushrooms, again, bowl mushrooms, know, equivalent
bowl mushroom 12 micrograms selenium. daily ration something
100 200 range, again, look area are. can see really quickly
even though things like mushrooms spinach milk yogurt lentils
cashews, now vegetarian segment list constructed,
probably not getting enough selenium. kind interesting thing.
experimenter get clearance doctor, try increasing
selenium levels see impacts metabolism. Again, Brazil nuts
probably going direct way get sufficient selenium levels
levels high Brazil nuts, also means overdo well. not
really aware consequences getting much selenium, although
can get much anything guessing consequences aren't good. also
want mention children, daily requirements selenium much lower,
low 30 40 micrograms kids 14 years younger. areas, really
want underscore this, amount selenium recommended daily low
55 micrograms. not shooting thousands even high levels
hundreds micrograms selenium. again, micrograms, not milligrams.
again, look need somebody interested keeping
thyroid function healthy productive, certainly want make sure
getting enough iodine, getting enough selenium getting enough L-
tyrosine. interesting start looking various foods, especially highly
processed foods, start realize

00:33:05 Selenium Pregnancy, Prostate Cancer Risk, Acne

perhaps many people, maybe you, not. Not incidentally, selenium


effects health can quite positive. even though don't relate
thyroid growth hormone function specifically, think might want know
them, given topic selenium. first three studies,
showed high efficacy reducing risk something called
preeclampsia, excuse me, preeclampsia. Preeclampsia seizures related
blood pressure issues around delivery new baby. actually,
rare-ish condition actually can quite deadly. fact selenium
important offsetting preeclampsia risk interesting. don't know exact
mechanism guessing either
pregnant thinking conceiving soon, worth noting. Obviously, anything
related pregnancy lactation, especially talk doctor. guessing
selenium probably lot prenatal formulas one clear benefit
sufficient selenium. reduced prostate cancer risk. study showing
sufficient selenium can reduce prostate cancer risk.
evidence consume foods areas soil low selenium, can
problem. last episode, talked issues related soil quality,
things making way food disrupting hormones forth.
sufficient selenium food offset low content soil.
apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk. minor effect statistically
significant one. one reduction acne, interesting.
guessing probably thyroid hormone pathway
way thyroid hormone can impact liver. turns liver various
biochemical reactions liver can impact acne. probably episode
just additional benefits getting sufficient selenium.

00:35:20 “Clean Eating” Downsides: Cruciferous Vegetables, Leeching Iodine

Okay, already deep tools related making sure sufficient
selenium, iodine, L-tyrosine order make enough thyroid hormones can
support metabolic processes liver, muscles, tendons, whatever
purpose, keeping metabolism high, body composition reasons healing,
keeping brain working well. Earlier mentioned, people following
clean diets. people consume no processed foods. know,
starch might eat going maybe rice grain protein might


consume going either from, hope, humanely raised animal sources
maybe pure plant-based. Believe not, folks actually
susceptible low iodine turns diets meat rich don't
many vegetables, well diets vegetable rich don't many
meats salts risk lowering thyroid hormone way iodine pathway
pathways. let try simplify you. Chances people
all-meat diet, not sprinkling, not wrapping steaks
seaweed may may not supplementing iodine. Chances
probably consuming iodine salt requirements go not consuming
vegetables. People consuming vegetables kind interesting. always
hear cruciferous vegetables important
actually substances, compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables
can interfere thyroid hormone function. eating lot stuff, lot
cabbages just look other, think broccoli cruciferous vegetable,
won't read off whole list, just put internet. always told
eat lot dark, leafy green stuff. Well, unless dark, leafy green stuff kelp
seaweed, chances not getting enough iodine unless adding salt
food. chances may lowering total amount thyroid
making, well fact plant-rich diets, hard get enough L-tyrosine
don't want, know, not inflame vegans carnivore folks.
don't take stance either way that. just learning, trying report
science. point want make health important. purely plant-
based eating lot cruciferous vegetables, make sure getting
enough iodine. seem like cruciferous vegetables can increase need
iodine. thing purely all-meat diet keto,
not ingesting many vegetables. always thought cleaner diet,
better, turns probably true standpoint of, know, hormone
regulation, know, estrogen testosterone hormones. highly
processed foods really terrible. much evidence that. phthalates
plastics processed foods emulsifiers, stuff talked
previous episode, seem people not getting enough iodine
whatever reason, really need check whether not iodine levels need
increased fact consuming many plants many
meats cases, plants actually lower thyroid hormone. not beat


dead horse cabbage,

00:39:00 Benefits Iodine: Reducing Inflammation

number things iodine can positive sort of,
related thyroid, not directly, kind offshoots thyroid pathway
downstream it, say, terms impact metabolic function.
One reduce something called c-reactive protein. may
heard CRP c-reactive protein. C-reactive protein something want
keep modestly low levels. associated inflammation various forms heart
disease even eye disease, macular degeneration. appear iodine
supplementation getting sufficient iodine food, either works, associated
reduced levels c-reactive protein blood anti-inflammatory effect.
anti-inflammatory effect brings us back old friend, interleukin 6. Remember,
inflammatory cytokines. many, many names
many, many them. Interleukin 10 one anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6
one inflammatory. Anytime see IL-6, usually means
inflammatory response, wound, inflammation brain, somebody
either sleep deprived brain injury dealing sort infection.
IL-6 kind catch-all inflammation. appear iodine
supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated inflammation.
sense, iodine can anti-inflammatory effect. now, abundantly
clear. care thyroid hormone, care pathways impacts
like high level metabolism, guess no reason attractive
'cause can eat still maintain healthy body composition, also
brain health, cognitive function, tissue repair, stuff, keeping c-reactive protein low,
keeping IL-6 low, make sure getting enough iodine, selenium L-tyrosine.

00:41:00 & Increased Thyroid Increases Metabolism

curious thyroid actually increases metabolism, allows eat more,
et cetera. relates something covered last issue, glucose. Remember
eat something, blood sugar goes up, insulin secreted pancreas
makes sure blood glucose doesn't go high, can damage tissues


low, can make hypoglycemic. Thyroid increases glucose uptake various
tissues, particular muscle bone. actually can increase bone mineral density,
really good thing. get older, injuries, say older, mean basically
30 older, reason can recover quickly injuries
healthy thyroid healthy thyroid pathways can consume energy.
energy diverted toward bone repair muscle repair cartilage repair.
way increasing ATP. whole idea iodine,
selenium, L-tyrosine, allow thyroid healthy levels thyroid can take
glucose blood divert tissues used, particular brain.
things talking about, supplementing getting food,

00:42:12 Eat Support Brain

can actually improve support brain function. People always asking me,
food eat brain? Like, blueberries good brain?
ask me, walnuts good brain 'cause looks like brain? talked
earlier. fact matter need nutrients support hormones
biological pathways support brain. way think it. realized
people ask, eat support brain? basically
asking short form. keeping thyroid hormone healthy healthy levels is,
going terrific brain 75% metabolism brain.
ability brain use glucose ketones matter going aided
healthy thyroid. things, take things, eat things going
allow

00:43:00 Hyperthyroidism (Too Much) & Hypothyroidism (Too Little)

healthy levels thyroid hormone. sure number
wondering, healthy levels thyroid hormone? can measured
blood. telltale signs really high thyroid really low thyroid,
start listing off. easy find online well. Things like bulging
eyes, inability maintain weight, shaky, anxiety, kind hyperthyroidal, thinning
hair, kind thing. don't want get diagnosing hypothyroidism
hyperthyroidism. just impossible 'cause kind


shouting back forth tunnel video comments. concerned
excessively high excessively low levels thyroid hormone, absolutely
look symptoms are. Talk physician. number good
treatments. didn't talk prescription drugs can improve symptoms related
hypo hyperthyroid. course, synthesized thyroid. don't make
enough thyroid, can take thyroid, prescription. much thyroid,
sometimes take thyroid gland can administer drugs will either
block receptors will interfere pathways brain pituitary
pituitary thyroid order adjust thyroid hormone way.
big guns terms treatments different thyroid disorders
not talking thyroid disorders, talking get maintain thyroid

00:44:35 Menstruation: Thyroid Carbohydrate & Sugar Craving

diet supplementation. also lot evidence people
menstruate, levels thyroid hormone can fluctuate dramatically across menstrual
cycle. really going process experimentation. don't know
could, could, theory, take blood different phases cycle figure
whether not thyroid hormone excessively high low different phases
cycle. going pretty tough do. endocrinologist
willing you, terrific. think people going figure
supplementing sorts things talked before, getting foods
relates different aspects cycle. general, first half cycle
ovulation, people crave carbohydrates sweets makes total sense
based biology menstrual cycle. Thyroid hormone going go you,
anyone, male female, menstruating not,

00:45:33 Ketogenic Diet & Effects Thyroid, Rebound Weight Gain

increases starchy carbohydrates. interesting ketogenic diets
shown slightly lower thyroid levels. makes sense ketogenic
diets, blood glucose levels low. thyroid hormone secreted large part
proportion much glucose bloodstream much glucose,


excuse me, needs regulated. not trying demonize ketogenic diet.
think definitely place. 22 studies now showing can dramatically
reduce blood glucose. third show thyroid hormone levels
slightly reduced, sometimes significantly, not more, ketogenic diet may
explain, want highlight may explain fact people go back
traditional diet ketogenic diet long time, oftentimes will
gain weight quickly bring carbohydrates back diet. people
cycling ketogenic non-ketogenic every three, four days. So-called
cyclical ketogenic diet. people staying ketogenic long periods time.
people six days on, one day off. huge variation there. point
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates particular, support healthy production
T3 T4. low carbohydrate, going reduction
T3 T4. going bring carbohydrates back diet,

pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells

People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,

00:53:40 Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know Natural TriggerS



talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth

want emphasize, talk doctor anything, including remove
treatments. anything add take away, responsibility
healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly
tissue repair, et cetera, need get slow-wave sleep so-called deep
sleep need blood insulin glucose relatively low. eating within two
hours sleep,

00:54:49 Not Eating Within 2hrs Sleep: Keep Blood Glucose Low(ish) Sleep

excuse me, eating within two hours going sleep going suppress growth

trouble falling asleep. episodes sleep covered
episodes two, three, four Huberman Lab Podcast has, believe, tools
ever want make use terms optimize sleep.
can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.

peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can

Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know

Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care

adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close

stimulating hormone, shut signal make more, kind like thermostat.
levels low, like not enough testosterone bloodstream
not enough estrogen, brain will continue push signal make more.
Similarly, not enough thyroid circulating not enough iodine make
thyroid, therefore not enough thyroid hormone circulating, thyroid gland not
getting shut down. tons stimulating hormone releasing hormone coming
brain, like release, release, release, no way can make thyroid
hormone gland just gets bigger bigger bigger. people get
goiter. one reasons table salt iodine it. Although
foods iodine well. much iodine need?

00:26:05 Much Iodine Need? Food, Supplement Ocean Air

Well, don't need whole lot. people hypothyroidal might, want
emphasize might, absolutely talk doctor. serious matter.
Anytime talking hormones manipulating levels thyroid, absolutely
want talk doctor. people benefit supplementing iodine.
contained salts. Himalayan salt, not always, often. know days,
lot excitement pink salts sea salts what, know,
kind artisan salt thing kind taken off foodie land, great.
actually quite tasty. can just take directly like taste salt.
iodine can supplemented things like kelp seaweed kelp tablets.
Now, hyperthyroidal, make much thyroid, actually can
problem. really, best way figure get blood levels tested
thyroid hormone. much iodine ocean believe not people
live near coast can actually just absorb air, just breathing ocean
air. gives sense just little iodine actually need consume
food salt. within miles ocean visit ocean
time time, probably getting plenty. come together,
mentioned, L-tyrosine, foods contain L-tyrosine, provided
sufficient iodine diet, sufficient selenium
diet, serve increase metabolism. growth repair
tissues. really important. not just keeping metabolism high
can leaner side things adjust body weight, excuse me,


body composition ratios way like. Repair injuries, repair brain tissue,
clearance damage neurons, clearance damage body also
going depend thyroid. Again, metabolism kind rate fuel
consumption use body, generally,

00:28:09 Selenium Thyroid: Brazil Nuts & Valuable Sources

not just body mass indexes things sort. talk selenium
really important. even though people getting lot sufficient
iodine, people probably getting enough L-tyrosine. guessing
people may not getting enough selenium goal increase thyroid hormone,
least literature says. Without going biochemistry, selenium
important order thyroid hormone made way allows L-
tyrosine iodine interact. thing people aren't getting enough
selenium don't eat foods high selenium. Now, much
selenium need will depend live. actually varies country country.
countries found say get 100 micrograms, say 200,
say 155. average 155 micrograms, countries looked at. People
trying increase thyroid levels might want consume selenium.
consume vitamin, course, want make sure selenium not
overdoing consuming lot selenium rich foods either. nonetheless, think
fair say people probably well ingesting slightly selenium
currently are. Although, course, always talk doctor. Brazil nuts
heavyweight champion foods get selenium from. high concentrations
selenium. just six eight Brazil nuts contain something like 550 micrograms
selenium. also present fish. certain fish like yellowfin tuna, although nowadays
whenever mention tuna shellfish, rich source selenium, people
will tell immediately sorts issues around farm, not farm, mercury, et
cetera. never particularly liked eating fish 'cause way tastes.
avoid it. like it, sure much skilled
knowing fish buy fish not buy. Ham, things, contains lot
selenium, whatever reason pork does. not big consumer pork. Beef
selenium, interesting look sources, know, pork, beef, turkey,
chicken, cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice, want understand Brazil


nuts, six eight Brazil nuts 550 micrograms selenium. foods
mentioned much greater portion size equivalent six eight Brazil nuts, either
volume calories, something like 30 50 micrograms selenium.
not eating Brazil nuts, guessing people aren't, not eating
lot animal based foods, know many aren't, probably not
getting enough selenium. again, can levels measured can
just check consuming figure whether not meeting ration
need order get healthy levels thyroid. present things like
mushrooms, again, bowl mushrooms, know, equivalent
bowl mushroom 12 micrograms selenium. daily ration something
100 200 range, again, look area are. can see really quickly
even though things like mushrooms spinach milk yogurt lentils
cashews, now vegetarian segment list constructed,
probably not getting enough selenium. kind interesting thing.
experimenter get clearance doctor, try increasing
selenium levels see impacts metabolism. Again, Brazil nuts
probably going direct way get sufficient selenium levels
levels high Brazil nuts, also means overdo well. not
really aware consequences getting much selenium, although
can get much anything guessing consequences aren't good. also
want mention children, daily requirements selenium much lower,
low 30 40 micrograms kids 14 years younger. areas, really
want underscore this, amount selenium recommended daily low
55 micrograms. not shooting thousands even high levels
hundreds micrograms selenium. again, micrograms, not milligrams.
again, look need somebody interested keeping
thyroid function healthy productive, certainly want make sure
getting enough iodine, getting enough selenium getting enough L-
tyrosine. interesting start looking various foods, especially highly
processed foods, start realize

00:33:05 Selenium Pregnancy, Prostate Cancer Risk, Acne

perhaps many people, maybe you, not. Not incidentally, selenium


effects health can quite positive. even though don't relate
thyroid growth hormone function specifically, think might want know
them, given topic selenium. first three studies,
showed high efficacy reducing risk something called
preeclampsia, excuse me, preeclampsia. Preeclampsia seizures related
blood pressure issues around delivery new baby. actually,
rare-ish condition actually can quite deadly. fact selenium
important offsetting preeclampsia risk interesting. don't know exact
mechanism guessing either
pregnant thinking conceiving soon, worth noting. Obviously, anything
related pregnancy lactation, especially talk doctor. guessing
selenium probably lot prenatal formulas one clear benefit
sufficient selenium. reduced prostate cancer risk. study showing
sufficient selenium can reduce prostate cancer risk.
evidence consume foods areas soil low selenium, can
problem. last episode, talked issues related soil quality,
things making way food disrupting hormones forth.
sufficient selenium food offset low content soil.
apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk. minor effect statistically
significant one. one reduction acne, interesting.
guessing probably thyroid hormone pathway
way thyroid hormone can impact liver. turns liver various
biochemical reactions liver can impact acne. probably episode
just additional benefits getting sufficient selenium.

00:35:20 “Clean Eating” Downsides: Cruciferous Vegetables, Leeching Iodine

Okay, already deep tools related making sure sufficient
selenium, iodine, L-tyrosine order make enough thyroid hormones can
support metabolic processes liver, muscles, tendons, whatever
purpose, keeping metabolism high, body composition reasons healing,
keeping brain working well. Earlier mentioned, people following
clean diets. people consume no processed foods. know,
starch might eat going maybe rice grain protein might


consume going either from, hope, humanely raised animal sources
maybe pure plant-based. Believe not, folks actually
susceptible low iodine turns diets meat rich don't
many vegetables, well diets vegetable rich don't many
meats salts risk lowering thyroid hormone way iodine pathway
pathways. let try simplify you. Chances people
all-meat diet, not sprinkling, not wrapping steaks
seaweed may may not supplementing iodine. Chances
probably consuming iodine salt requirements go not consuming
vegetables. People consuming vegetables kind interesting. always
hear cruciferous vegetables important
actually substances, compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables
can interfere thyroid hormone function. eating lot stuff, lot
cabbages just look other, think broccoli cruciferous vegetable,
won't read off whole list, just put internet. always told
eat lot dark, leafy green stuff. Well, unless dark, leafy green stuff kelp
seaweed, chances not getting enough iodine unless adding salt
food. chances may lowering total amount thyroid
making, well fact plant-rich diets, hard get enough L-tyrosine
don't want, know, not inflame vegans carnivore folks.
don't take stance either way that. just learning, trying report
science. point want make health important. purely plant-
based eating lot cruciferous vegetables, make sure getting
enough iodine. seem like cruciferous vegetables can increase need
iodine. thing purely all-meat diet keto,
not ingesting many vegetables. always thought cleaner diet,
better, turns probably true standpoint of, know, hormone
regulation, know, estrogen testosterone hormones. highly
processed foods really terrible. much evidence that. phthalates
plastics processed foods emulsifiers, stuff talked
previous episode, seem people not getting enough iodine
whatever reason, really need check whether not iodine levels need
increased fact consuming many plants many
meats cases, plants actually lower thyroid hormone. not beat


dead horse cabbage,

00:39:00 Benefits Iodine: Reducing Inflammation

number things iodine can positive sort of,
related thyroid, not directly, kind offshoots thyroid pathway
downstream it, say, terms impact metabolic function.
One reduce something called c-reactive protein. may
heard CRP c-reactive protein. C-reactive protein something want
keep modestly low levels. associated inflammation various forms heart
disease even eye disease, macular degeneration. appear iodine
supplementation getting sufficient iodine food, either works, associated
reduced levels c-reactive protein blood anti-inflammatory effect.
anti-inflammatory effect brings us back old friend, interleukin 6. Remember,
inflammatory cytokines. many, many names
many, many them. Interleukin 10 one anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6
one inflammatory. Anytime see IL-6, usually means
inflammatory response, wound, inflammation brain, somebody
either sleep deprived brain injury dealing sort infection.
IL-6 kind catch-all inflammation. appear iodine
supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated inflammation.
sense, iodine can anti-inflammatory effect. now, abundantly
clear. care thyroid hormone, care pathways impacts
like high level metabolism, guess no reason attractive
'cause can eat still maintain healthy body composition, also
brain health, cognitive function, tissue repair, stuff, keeping c-reactive protein low,
keeping IL-6 low, make sure getting enough iodine, selenium L-tyrosine.

00:41:00 & Increased Thyroid Increases Metabolism

curious thyroid actually increases metabolism, allows eat more,
et cetera. relates something covered last issue, glucose. Remember
eat something, blood sugar goes up, insulin secreted pancreas
makes sure blood glucose doesn't go high, can damage tissues


low, can make hypoglycemic. Thyroid increases glucose uptake various
tissues, particular muscle bone. actually can increase bone mineral density,
really good thing. get older, injuries, say older, mean basically
30 older, reason can recover quickly injuries
healthy thyroid healthy thyroid pathways can consume energy.
energy diverted toward bone repair muscle repair cartilage repair.
way increasing ATP. whole idea iodine,
selenium, L-tyrosine, allow thyroid healthy levels thyroid can take
glucose blood divert tissues used, particular brain.
things talking about, supplementing getting food,

00:42:12 Eat Support Brain

can actually improve support brain function. People always asking me,
food eat brain? Like, blueberries good brain?
ask me, walnuts good brain 'cause looks like brain? talked
earlier. fact matter need nutrients support hormones
biological pathways support brain. way think it. realized
people ask, eat support brain? basically
asking short form. keeping thyroid hormone healthy healthy levels is,
going terrific brain 75% metabolism brain.
ability brain use glucose ketones matter going aided
healthy thyroid. things, take things, eat things going

00:44:35 Menstruation: Thyroid Carbohydrate & Sugar Craving

diet supplementation. also lot evidence people
menstruate, levels thyroid hormone can fluctuate dramatically across menstrual
cycle. really going process experimentation. don't know
could, could, theory, take blood different phases cycle figure
whether not thyroid hormone excessively high low different phases
cycle. going pretty tough do. endocrinologist
willing you, terrific. think people going figure
supplementing sorts things talked before, getting foods
relates different aspects cycle. general, first half cycle
ovulation, people crave carbohydrates sweets makes total sense
based biology menstrual cycle. Thyroid hormone going go you,
anyone, male female, menstruating not,

00:45:33 Ketogenic Diet & Effects Thyroid, Rebound Weight Gain

increases starchy carbohydrates. interesting ketogenic diets
shown slightly lower thyroid levels. makes sense ketogenic
diets, blood glucose levels low. thyroid hormone secreted large part
proportion much glucose bloodstream much glucose,


excuse me, needs regulated. not trying demonize ketogenic diet.
think definitely place. 22 studies now showing can dramatically
reduce blood glucose. third show thyroid hormone levels
slightly reduced, sometimes significantly, not more, ketogenic diet may
explain, want highlight may explain fact people go back
traditional diet ketogenic diet long time, oftentimes will
gain weight quickly bring carbohydrates back diet. people
cycling ketogenic non-ketogenic every three, four days. So-called
cyclical ketogenic diet. people staying ketogenic long periods time.
people six days on, one day off. huge variation there. point
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates particular, support healthy production
T3 T4. low carbohydrate, going reduction
T3 T4. going bring carbohydrates back diet,
might want gradually. menstruate, craving
carbohydrates early part cycle, actually associated
healthy cycle. healthy cycle ketogenic diet,
interesting. Maybe let know comments point direction
research aware it. can start see, really
beautiful interplay different hormones, insulin glucose,
estrogen thyroid, thyroid blood glucose ketogenic
diet. starts fit together ways make lot sense understand just
kind core elements hormones variety tissues
work on. simple version haven't carbohydrate year,
T3, T4 levels going pretty low. sure ketonistas
there. going say, wait, no, thyroid hormone levels go keto. might
true reasons, indirect reasons related hormone pathways
cascade ketosis long periods time. Great. people
don't consume carbohydrate, T3, T4 going go down. start
consume foods require thyroid metabolism order work with, metabolize,
weight gain can sometimes happen quickly. just something consider.
something work carefully going cyclic ketogenic, long-term
ketogenic. not ketogenic, consuming carbohydrates.
three things talked earlier, selenium, tyrosine iodine, chances

00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work
parallel. lumped together episode. increase
metabolism repair growth tissues. conversation growth hormone
incomplete didn't talk kind extremes. certain
people born don't make enough growth hormone, end
short stature. certain people make ton growth hormone
end very, large. tend large appendages.
something called acromegaly. kind like ridging forehead. actually
bone ridge. giant. used called giantism. people course
range height appendage length. doesn't imply growth
hormone disruption there. Growth hormone received lot attention
sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth
hormone. Today, going talk things anyone can increase
growth hormone. reasons certain people want that.
People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,


unquote, levels growth hormone might want

features. Height, just one those. age, make less growth
hormone. one reasons recover slowly injuries.
one reasons accumulate body fat. one reasons
metabolism slows. growth hormone replacement therapy tremendously
popular last 20 years, not say doesn't carry problems, does.
one major problems injecting growth hormone. Not saying people
shouldn't doctor approved keeping particular life

based interact behaviors supplements. cool
discussion growth hormone tools exist
increase growth hormone actionable. people can without
need equipment even supplement. Although supplement
related themes tools growth hormone increase. also increases one
can get growth hormone substantial. normally, talk
difference taking something exogenous substance like testosterone

00:53:40 Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know Natural TriggerS



talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth
hormone, chances things going benefit you. However, always,
want emphasize, talk doctor anything, including remove
treatments. anything add take away, responsibility
healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly
tissue repair, et cetera, need get slow-wave sleep so-called deep
sleep need blood insulin glucose relatively low. eating within two
hours sleep,

00:54:49 Not Eating Within 2hrs Sleep: Keep Blood Glucose Low(ish) Sleep

excuse me, eating within two hours going sleep going suppress growth

falling asleep hungry. work decide
going eat. going eat thing not hungry
trouble falling asleep. episodes sleep covered
episodes two, three, four Huberman Lab Podcast has, believe, tools
ever want make use terms optimize sleep.
can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line

exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional
conversation. brain telling body hormones make. hormones
influencing tissues body also telling brain

00:28:09 Selenium Thyroid: Brazil Nuts & Valuable Sources

not just body mass indexes things sort. talk selenium
really important. even though people getting lot sufficient
iodine, people probably getting enough L-tyrosine. guessing
people may not getting enough selenium goal increase thyroid hormone,
least literature says. Without going biochemistry, selenium
important order thyroid hormone made way allows L-
tyrosine iodine interact. thing people aren't getting enough
selenium don't eat foods high selenium. Now, much
selenium need will depend live. actually varies country country.
countries found say get 100 micrograms, say 200,
say 155. average 155 micrograms, countries looked at. People
trying increase thyroid levels might want consume selenium.
consume vitamin, course, want make sure selenium not
overdoing consuming lot selenium rich foods either. nonetheless, think
fair say people probably well ingesting slightly selenium
currently are. Although, course, always talk doctor. Brazil nuts
heavyweight champion foods get selenium from. high concentrations
selenium. just six eight Brazil nuts contain something like 550 micrograms
selenium. also present fish. certain fish like yellowfin tuna, although nowadays
whenever mention tuna shellfish, rich source selenium, people
will tell immediately sorts issues around farm, not farm, mercury, et
cetera. never particularly liked eating fish 'cause way tastes.
avoid it. like it, sure much skilled
knowing fish buy fish not buy. Ham, things, contains lot
selenium, whatever reason pork does. not big consumer pork. Beef
selenium, interesting look sources, know, pork, beef, turkey,
chicken, cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice, want understand Brazil


nuts, six eight Brazil nuts 550 micrograms selenium. foods
mentioned much greater portion size equivalent six eight Brazil nuts, either
volume calories, something like 30 50 micrograms selenium.
not eating Brazil nuts, guessing people aren't, not eating
lot animal based foods, know many aren't, probably not
getting enough selenium. again, can levels measured can
just check consuming figure whether not meeting ration
need order get healthy levels thyroid. present things like
mushrooms, again, bowl mushrooms, know, equivalent
bowl mushroom 12 micrograms selenium. daily ration something
100 200 range, again, look area are. can see really quickly
even though things like mushrooms spinach milk yogurt lentils
cashews, now vegetarian segment list constructed,
probably not getting enough selenium. kind interesting thing.
experimenter get clearance doctor, try increasing
selenium levels see impacts metabolism. Again, Brazil nuts
probably going direct way get sufficient selenium levels
levels high Brazil nuts, also means overdo well. not
really aware consequences getting much selenium, although
can get much anything guessing consequences aren't good. also
want mention children, daily requirements selenium much lower,
low 30 40 micrograms kids 14 years younger. areas, really
want underscore this, amount selenium recommended daily low
55 micrograms. not shooting thousands even high levels
hundreds micrograms selenium. again, micrograms, not milligrams.
again, look need somebody interested keeping
thyroid function healthy productive, certainly want make sure
getting enough iodine, getting enough selenium getting enough L-
tyrosine. interesting start looking various foods, especially highly
processed foods, start realize

00:33:05 Selenium Pregnancy, Prostate Cancer Risk, Acne

perhaps many people, maybe you, not. Not incidentally, selenium


effects health can quite positive. even though don't relate
thyroid growth hormone function specifically, think might want know
them, given topic selenium. first three studies,
showed high efficacy reducing risk something called
preeclampsia, excuse me, preeclampsia. Preeclampsia seizures related
blood pressure issues around delivery new baby. actually,
rare-ish condition actually can quite deadly. fact selenium
important offsetting preeclampsia risk interesting. don't know exact
mechanism guessing either
pregnant thinking conceiving soon, worth noting. Obviously, anything
related pregnancy lactation, especially talk doctor. guessing
selenium probably lot prenatal formulas one clear benefit
sufficient selenium. reduced prostate cancer risk. study showing
sufficient selenium can reduce prostate cancer risk.
evidence consume foods areas soil low selenium, can
problem. last episode, talked issues related soil quality,
things making way food disrupting hormones forth.
sufficient selenium food offset low content soil.
apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk. minor effect statistically
significant one. one reduction acne, interesting.
guessing probably thyroid hormone pathway
way thyroid hormone can impact liver. turns liver various
biochemical reactions liver can impact acne. probably episode
just additional benefits getting sufficient selenium.

00:35:20 “Clean Eating” Downsides: Cruciferous Vegetables, Leeching Iodine

Okay, already deep tools related making sure sufficient
selenium, iodine, L-tyrosine order make enough thyroid hormones can
support metabolic processes liver, muscles, tendons, whatever
purpose, keeping metabolism high, body composition reasons healing,
keeping brain working well. Earlier mentioned, people following
clean diets. people consume no processed foods. know,
starch might eat going maybe rice grain protein might


consume going either from, hope, humanely raised animal sources
maybe pure plant-based. Believe not, folks actually
susceptible low iodine turns diets meat rich don't
many vegetables, well diets vegetable rich don't many
meats salts risk lowering thyroid hormone way iodine pathway
pathways. let try simplify you. Chances people
all-meat diet, not sprinkling, not wrapping steaks
seaweed may may not supplementing iodine. Chances
probably consuming iodine salt requirements go not consuming
vegetables. People consuming vegetables kind interesting. always
hear cruciferous vegetables important
actually substances, compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables
can interfere thyroid hormone function. eating lot stuff, lot
cabbages just look other, think broccoli cruciferous vegetable,
won't read off whole list, just put internet. always told
eat lot dark, leafy green stuff. Well, unless dark, leafy green stuff kelp
seaweed, chances not getting enough iodine unless adding salt
food. chances may lowering total amount thyroid
making, well fact plant-rich diets, hard get enough L-tyrosine
don't want, know, not inflame vegans carnivore folks.
don't take stance either way that. just learning, trying report
science. point want make health important. purely plant-
based eating lot cruciferous vegetables, make sure getting
enough iodine. seem like cruciferous vegetables can increase need
iodine. thing purely all-meat diet keto,
not ingesting many vegetables. always thought cleaner diet,
better, turns probably true standpoint of, know, hormone
regulation, know, estrogen testosterone hormones. highly
processed foods really terrible. much evidence that. phthalates
plastics processed foods emulsifiers, stuff talked
previous episode, seem people not getting enough iodine
whatever reason, really need check whether not iodine levels need
increased fact consuming many plants many
meats cases, plants actually lower thyroid hormone. not beat


dead horse cabbage,

00:39:00 Benefits Iodine: Reducing Inflammation

number things iodine can positive sort of,
related thyroid, not directly, kind offshoots thyroid pathway
downstream it, say, terms impact metabolic function.
One reduce something called c-reactive protein. may
heard CRP c-reactive protein. C-reactive protein something want
keep modestly low levels. associated inflammation various forms heart
disease even eye disease, macular degeneration. appear iodine
supplementation getting sufficient iodine food, either works, associated
reduced levels c-reactive protein blood anti-inflammatory effect.
anti-inflammatory effect brings us back old friend, interleukin 6. Remember,
inflammatory cytokines. many, many names
many, many them. Interleukin 10 one anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6
one inflammatory. Anytime see IL-6, usually means
inflammatory response, wound, inflammation brain, somebody
either sleep deprived brain injury dealing sort infection.
IL-6 kind catch-all inflammation. appear iodine
supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated inflammation.
sense, iodine can anti-inflammatory effect. now, abundantly
clear. care thyroid hormone, care pathways impacts
like high level metabolism, guess no reason attractive
'cause can eat still maintain healthy body composition, also
brain health, cognitive function, tissue repair, stuff, keeping c-reactive protein low,
keeping IL-6 low, make sure getting enough iodine, selenium L-tyrosine.

00:41:00 & Increased Thyroid Increases Metabolism

curious thyroid actually increases metabolism, allows eat more,
et cetera. relates something covered last issue, glucose. Remember
eat something, blood sugar goes up, insulin secreted pancreas
makes sure blood glucose doesn't go high, can damage tissues


low, can make hypoglycemic. Thyroid increases glucose uptake various
tissues, particular muscle bone. actually can increase bone mineral density,
really good thing. get older, injuries, say older, mean basically
30 older, reason can recover quickly injuries
healthy thyroid healthy thyroid pathways can consume energy.
energy diverted toward bone repair muscle repair cartilage repair.
way increasing ATP. whole idea iodine,
selenium, L-tyrosine, allow thyroid healthy levels thyroid can take
glucose blood divert tissues used, particular brain.
things talking about, supplementing getting food,

00:42:12 Eat Support Brain

can actually improve support brain function. People always asking me,
food eat brain? Like, blueberries good brain?
ask me, walnuts good brain 'cause looks like brain? talked
earlier. fact matter need nutrients support hormones
biological pathways support brain. way think it. realized
people ask, eat support brain? basically
asking short form. keeping thyroid hormone healthy healthy levels is,
going terrific brain 75% metabolism brain.
ability brain use glucose ketones matter going aided
healthy thyroid. things, take things, eat things going
allow

00:43:00 Hyperthyroidism (Too Much) & Hypothyroidism (Too Little)

healthy levels thyroid hormone. sure number
wondering, healthy levels thyroid hormone? can measured
blood. telltale signs really high thyroid really low thyroid,
start listing off. easy find online well. Things like bulging
eyes, inability maintain weight, shaky, anxiety, kind hyperthyroidal, thinning
hair, kind thing. don't want get diagnosing hypothyroidism
hyperthyroidism. just impossible 'cause kind


shouting back forth tunnel video comments. concerned
excessively high excessively low levels thyroid hormone, absolutely
look symptoms are. Talk physician. number good
treatments. didn't talk prescription drugs can improve symptoms related
hypo hyperthyroid. course, synthesized thyroid. don't make
enough thyroid, can take thyroid, prescription. much thyroid,
sometimes take thyroid gland can administer drugs will either
block receptors will interfere pathways brain pituitary
pituitary thyroid order adjust thyroid hormone way.
big guns terms treatments different thyroid disorders
not talking thyroid disorders, talking get maintain thyroid
levels healthy ranges straightforward ways

00:44:35 Menstruation: Thyroid Carbohydrate & Sugar Craving

diet supplementation. also lot evidence people
menstruate, levels thyroid hormone can fluctuate dramatically across menstrual
cycle. really going process experimentation. don't know
could, could, theory, take blood different phases cycle figure
whether not thyroid hormone excessively high low different phases
cycle. going pretty tough do. endocrinologist

00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work

sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth

growth hormone. reasons certain people want that.
People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,

talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels

healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly
tissue repair, et cetera, need get slow-wave sleep so-called deep
sleep need blood insulin glucose relatively low. eating within two
hours sleep,

trouble falling asleep. episodes sleep covered
episodes two, three, four Huberman Lab Podcast has, believe, tools
ever want make use terms optimize sleep.
can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding

nuts, six eight Brazil nuts 550 micrograms selenium. foods
mentioned much greater portion size equivalent six eight Brazil nuts, either
volume calories, something like 30 50 micrograms selenium.
not eating Brazil nuts, guessing people aren't, not eating
lot animal based foods, know many aren't, probably not
getting enough selenium. again, can levels measured can
just check consuming figure whether not meeting ration
need order get healthy levels thyroid. present things like
mushrooms, again, bowl mushrooms, know, equivalent
bowl mushroom 12 micrograms selenium. daily ration something
100 200 range, again, look area are. can see really quickly
even though things like mushrooms spinach milk yogurt lentils
cashews, now vegetarian segment list constructed,
probably not getting enough selenium. kind interesting thing.
experimenter get clearance doctor, try increasing
selenium levels see impacts metabolism. Again, Brazil nuts
probably going direct way get sufficient selenium levels
levels high Brazil nuts, also means overdo well. not
really aware consequences getting much selenium, although
can get much anything guessing consequences aren't good. also
want mention children, daily requirements selenium much lower,
low 30 40 micrograms kids 14 years younger. areas, really
want underscore this, amount selenium recommended daily low
55 micrograms. not shooting thousands even high levels
hundreds micrograms selenium. again, micrograms, not milligrams.
again, look need somebody interested keeping
thyroid function healthy productive, certainly want make sure
getting enough iodine, getting enough selenium getting enough L-
tyrosine. interesting start looking various foods, especially highly
processed foods, start realize

00:33:05 Selenium Pregnancy, Prostate Cancer Risk, Acne

perhaps many people, maybe you, not. Not incidentally, selenium


effects health can quite positive. even though don't relate
thyroid growth hormone function specifically, think might want know
them, given topic selenium. first three studies,
showed high efficacy reducing risk something called
preeclampsia, excuse me, preeclampsia. Preeclampsia seizures related
blood pressure issues around delivery new baby. actually,
rare-ish condition actually can quite deadly. fact selenium
important offsetting preeclampsia risk interesting. don't know exact
mechanism guessing either
pregnant thinking conceiving soon, worth noting. Obviously, anything
related pregnancy lactation, especially talk doctor. guessing
selenium probably lot prenatal formulas one clear benefit
sufficient selenium. reduced prostate cancer risk. study showing
sufficient selenium can reduce prostate cancer risk.
evidence consume foods areas soil low selenium, can
problem. last episode, talked issues related soil quality,
things making way food disrupting hormones forth.
sufficient selenium food offset low content soil.
apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk. minor effect statistically
significant one. one reduction acne, interesting.
guessing probably thyroid hormone pathway
way thyroid hormone can impact liver. turns liver various
biochemical reactions liver can impact acne. probably episode
just additional benefits getting sufficient selenium.

00:35:20 “Clean Eating” Downsides: Cruciferous Vegetables, Leeching Iodine

Okay, already deep tools related making sure sufficient
selenium, iodine, L-tyrosine order make enough thyroid hormones can
support metabolic processes liver, muscles, tendons, whatever
purpose, keeping metabolism high, body composition reasons healing,
keeping brain working well. Earlier mentioned, people following
clean diets. people consume no processed foods. know,
starch might eat going maybe rice grain protein might


consume going either from, hope, humanely raised animal sources
maybe pure plant-based. Believe not, folks actually
susceptible low iodine turns diets meat rich don't
many vegetables, well diets vegetable rich don't many
meats salts risk lowering thyroid hormone way iodine pathway
pathways. let try simplify you. Chances people
all-meat diet, not sprinkling, not wrapping steaks
seaweed may may not supplementing iodine. Chances
probably consuming iodine salt requirements go not consuming
vegetables. People consuming vegetables kind interesting. always
hear cruciferous vegetables important
actually substances, compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables
can interfere thyroid hormone function. eating lot stuff, lot
cabbages just look other, think broccoli cruciferous vegetable,
won't read off whole list, just put internet. always told
eat lot dark, leafy green stuff. Well, unless dark, leafy green stuff kelp
seaweed, chances not getting enough iodine unless adding salt
food. chances may lowering total amount thyroid
making, well fact plant-rich diets, hard get enough L-tyrosine
don't want, know, not inflame vegans carnivore folks.
don't take stance either way that. just learning, trying report
science. point want make health important. purely plant-
based eating lot cruciferous vegetables, make sure getting
enough iodine. seem like cruciferous vegetables can increase need
iodine. thing purely all-meat diet keto,
not ingesting many vegetables. always thought cleaner diet,
better, turns probably true standpoint of, know, hormone
regulation, know, estrogen testosterone hormones. highly
processed foods really terrible. much evidence that. phthalates
plastics processed foods emulsifiers, stuff talked
previous episode, seem people not getting enough iodine
whatever reason, really need check whether not iodine levels need
increased fact consuming many plants many
meats cases, plants actually lower thyroid hormone. not beat


dead horse cabbage,

00:39:00 Benefits Iodine: Reducing Inflammation

number things iodine can positive sort of,
related thyroid, not directly, kind offshoots thyroid pathway
downstream it, say, terms impact metabolic function.
One reduce something called c-reactive protein. may
heard CRP c-reactive protein. C-reactive protein something want
keep modestly low levels. associated inflammation various forms heart
disease even eye disease, macular degeneration. appear iodine
supplementation getting sufficient iodine food, either works, associated
reduced levels c-reactive protein blood anti-inflammatory effect.
anti-inflammatory effect brings us back old friend, interleukin 6. Remember,
inflammatory cytokines. many, many names
many, many them. Interleukin 10 one anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6
one inflammatory. Anytime see IL-6, usually means
inflammatory response, wound, inflammation brain, somebody
either sleep deprived brain injury dealing sort infection.
IL-6 kind catch-all inflammation. appear iodine
supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated inflammation.
sense, iodine can anti-inflammatory effect. now, abundantly
clear. care thyroid hormone, care pathways impacts
like high level metabolism, guess no reason attractive
'cause can eat still maintain healthy body composition, also
brain health, cognitive function, tissue repair, stuff, keeping c-reactive protein low,
keeping IL-6 low, make sure getting enough iodine, selenium L-tyrosine.

00:41:00 & Increased Thyroid Increases Metabolism

curious thyroid actually increases metabolism, allows eat more,
et cetera. relates something covered last issue, glucose. Remember
eat something, blood sugar goes up, insulin secreted pancreas
makes sure blood glucose doesn't go high, can damage tissues


low, can make hypoglycemic. Thyroid increases glucose uptake various
tissues, particular muscle bone. actually can increase bone mineral density,
really good thing. get older, injuries, say older, mean basically
30 older, reason can recover quickly injuries
healthy thyroid healthy thyroid pathways can consume energy.
energy diverted toward bone repair muscle repair cartilage repair.
way increasing ATP. whole idea iodine,
selenium, L-tyrosine, allow thyroid healthy levels thyroid can take
glucose blood divert tissues used, particular brain.
things talking about, supplementing getting food,

00:42:12 Eat Support Brain

can actually improve support brain function. People always asking me,
food eat brain? Like, blueberries good brain?
ask me, walnuts good brain 'cause looks like brain? talked
earlier. fact matter need nutrients support hormones
biological pathways support brain. way think it. realized
people ask, eat support brain? basically
asking short form. keeping thyroid hormone healthy healthy levels is,
going terrific brain 75% metabolism brain.
ability brain use glucose ketones matter going aided
healthy thyroid. things, take things, eat things going
allow

00:43:00 Hyperthyroidism (Too Much) & Hypothyroidism (Too Little)

healthy levels thyroid hormone. sure number
wondering, healthy levels thyroid hormone? can measured
blood. telltale signs really high thyroid really low thyroid,
start listing off. easy find online well. Things like bulging

00:44:35 Menstruation: Thyroid Carbohydrate & Sugar Craving

diet supplementation. also lot evidence people
menstruate, levels thyroid hormone can fluctuate dramatically across menstrual
cycle. really going process experimentation. don't know
could, could, theory, take blood different phases cycle figure
whether not thyroid hormone excessively high low different phases
cycle. going pretty tough do. endocrinologist
willing you, terrific. think people going figure
supplementing sorts things talked before, getting foods
relates different aspects cycle. general, first half cycle
ovulation, people crave carbohydrates sweets makes total sense
based biology menstrual cycle. Thyroid hormone going go you,
anyone, male female, menstruating not,

00:45:33 Ketogenic Diet & Effects Thyroid, Rebound Weight Gain

increases starchy carbohydrates. interesting ketogenic diets
shown slightly lower thyroid levels. makes sense ketogenic
diets, blood glucose levels low. thyroid hormone secreted large part
proportion much glucose bloodstream much glucose,


excuse me, needs regulated. not trying demonize ketogenic diet.
think definitely place. 22 studies now showing can dramatically
reduce blood glucose. third show thyroid hormone levels
slightly reduced, sometimes significantly, not more, ketogenic diet may
explain, want highlight may explain fact people go back
traditional diet ketogenic diet long time, oftentimes will
gain weight quickly bring carbohydrates back diet. people
cycling ketogenic non-ketogenic every three, four days. So-called
cyclical ketogenic diet. people staying ketogenic long periods time.
people six days on, one day off. huge variation there. point
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates particular, support healthy production
T3 T4. low carbohydrate, going reduction
T3 T4. going bring carbohydrates back diet,
might want gradually. menstruate, craving
carbohydrates early part cycle, actually associated
healthy cycle. healthy cycle ketogenic diet,
interesting. Maybe let know comments point direction
research aware it. can start see, really
beautiful interplay different hormones, insulin glucose,
estrogen thyroid, thyroid blood glucose ketogenic
diet. starts fit together ways make lot sense understand just
kind core elements hormones variety tissues
work on. simple version haven't carbohydrate year,
T3, T4 levels going pretty low. sure ketonistas
there. going say, wait, no, thyroid hormone levels go keto. might
true reasons, indirect reasons related hormone pathways
cascade ketosis long periods time. Great. people
don't consume carbohydrate, T3, T4 going go down. start
consume foods require thyroid metabolism order work with, metabolize,
weight gain can sometimes happen quickly. just something consider.
something work carefully going cyclic ketogenic, long-term
ketogenic. not ketogenic, consuming carbohydrates.
three things talked earlier, selenium, tyrosine iodine, chances
unless underlying condition



00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work
parallel. lumped together episode. increase
metabolism repair growth tissues. conversation growth hormone
incomplete didn't talk kind extremes. certain
people born don't make enough growth hormone, end
short stature. certain people make ton growth hormone
end very, large. tend large appendages.
something called acromegaly. kind like ridging forehead. actually
bone ridge. giant. used called giantism. people course
range height appendage length. doesn't imply growth
hormone disruption there. Growth hormone received lot attention
sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth
hormone. Today, going talk things anyone can increase
growth hormone. reasons certain people want that.
People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,


unquote, levels growth hormone might want

00:51:18 Growth Hormone (GH) Changes Across Lifespan & Risks GH Therapy

age puberty development, pituitary churning tons
growth hormone. responsible growth, not surprising, body
features. Height, just one those. age, make less growth
hormone. one reasons recover slowly injuries.
one reasons accumulate body fat. one reasons
metabolism slows. growth hormone replacement therapy tremendously
popular last 20 years, not say doesn't carry problems, does.
one major problems injecting growth hormone. Not saying people
shouldn't doctor approved keeping particular life
goals, growth hormone, levels high, will cause growth
tissues. not just muscle, not just reduction body fat metabolizing, know,
allowing fatty acids pulled storage used ATP, will also cause
increase growth heart lungs liver spleen.
concern abuse growth hormone. not going talking abuse
growth hormone. will, however, talk tools anyone can use increase
levels growth hormone. behavioral, supplement-
based interact behaviors supplements. cool
discussion growth hormone tools exist
increase growth hormone actionable. people can without
need equipment even supplement. Although supplement
related themes tools growth hormone increase. also increases one
can get growth hormone substantial. normally, talk
difference taking something exogenous substance like testosterone
estrogen versus using supplements behaviors increase them, talking
tenfold differences from, know, administering prescription compound. terms
growth hormone, things can increase growth hormone three, four, 500%
more. even though short-lived increase, can powerful effects
metabolism repair tissues.

00:53:40 Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know Natural TriggerS



talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth
hormone, chances things going benefit you. However, always,
want emphasize, talk doctor anything, including remove
treatments. anything add take away, responsibility
healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly
tissue repair, et cetera, need get slow-wave sleep so-called deep
sleep need blood insulin glucose relatively low. eating within two
hours sleep,

00:54:49 Not Eating Within 2hrs Sleep: Keep Blood Glucose Low(ish) Sleep

excuse me, eating within two hours going sleep going suppress growth
hormone release. clear. However, people going problems
falling asleep hungry. work decide
going eat. going eat thing not hungry
trouble falling asleep. episodes sleep covered
episodes two, three, four Huberman Lab Podcast has, believe, tools
ever want make use terms optimize sleep.
can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional
conversation. brain telling body hormones make. hormones
influencing tissues body also telling brain

effects health can quite positive. even though don't relate
thyroid growth hormone function specifically, think might want know
them, given topic selenium. first three studies,
showed high efficacy reducing risk something called
preeclampsia, excuse me, preeclampsia. Preeclampsia seizures related
blood pressure issues around delivery new baby. actually,
rare-ish condition actually can quite deadly. fact selenium
important offsetting preeclampsia risk interesting. don't know exact
mechanism guessing either
pregnant thinking conceiving soon, worth noting. Obviously, anything
related pregnancy lactation, especially talk doctor. guessing
selenium probably lot prenatal formulas one clear benefit
sufficient selenium. reduced prostate cancer risk. study showing
sufficient selenium can reduce prostate cancer risk.
evidence consume foods areas soil low selenium, can
problem. last episode, talked issues related soil quality,
things making way food disrupting hormones forth.
sufficient selenium food offset low content soil.
apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk. minor effect statistically
significant one. one reduction acne, interesting.
guessing probably thyroid hormone pathway
way thyroid hormone can impact liver. turns liver various
biochemical reactions liver can impact acne. probably episode
just additional benefits getting sufficient selenium.

00:35:20 “Clean Eating” Downsides: Cruciferous Vegetables, Leeching Iodine

Okay, already deep tools related making sure sufficient
selenium, iodine, L-tyrosine order make enough thyroid hormones can
support metabolic processes liver, muscles, tendons, whatever
purpose, keeping metabolism high, body composition reasons healing,
keeping brain working well. Earlier mentioned, people following
clean diets. people consume no processed foods. know,
starch might eat going maybe rice grain protein might


consume going either from, hope, humanely raised animal sources
maybe pure plant-based. Believe not, folks actually
susceptible low iodine turns diets meat rich don't
many vegetables, well diets vegetable rich don't many
meats salts risk lowering thyroid hormone way iodine pathway
pathways. let try simplify you. Chances people
all-meat diet, not sprinkling, not wrapping steaks
seaweed may may not supplementing iodine. Chances
probably consuming iodine salt requirements go not consuming
vegetables. People consuming vegetables kind interesting. always
hear cruciferous vegetables important
actually substances, compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables
can interfere thyroid hormone function. eating lot stuff, lot
cabbages just look other, think broccoli cruciferous vegetable,
won't read off whole list, just put internet. always told
eat lot dark, leafy green stuff. Well, unless dark, leafy green stuff kelp
seaweed, chances not getting enough iodine unless adding salt
food. chances may lowering total amount thyroid
making, well fact plant-rich diets, hard get enough L-tyrosine
don't want, know, not inflame vegans carnivore folks.
don't take stance either way that. just learning, trying report
science. point want make health important. purely plant-
based eating lot cruciferous vegetables, make sure getting
enough iodine. seem like cruciferous vegetables can increase need
iodine. thing purely all-meat diet keto,
not ingesting many vegetables. always thought cleaner diet,
better, turns probably true standpoint of, know, hormone
regulation, know, estrogen testosterone hormones. highly
processed foods really terrible. much evidence that. phthalates
plastics processed foods emulsifiers, stuff talked
previous episode, seem people not getting enough iodine
whatever reason, really need check whether not iodine levels need
increased fact consuming many plants many
meats cases, plants actually lower thyroid hormone. not beat


dead horse cabbage,

00:39:00 Benefits Iodine: Reducing Inflammation

number things iodine can positive sort of,
related thyroid, not directly, kind offshoots thyroid pathway
downstream it, say, terms impact metabolic function.
One reduce something called c-reactive protein. may
heard CRP c-reactive protein. C-reactive protein something want
keep modestly low levels. associated inflammation various forms heart
disease even eye disease, macular degeneration. appear iodine
supplementation getting sufficient iodine food, either works, associated
reduced levels c-reactive protein blood anti-inflammatory effect.
anti-inflammatory effect brings us back old friend, interleukin 6. Remember,
inflammatory cytokines. many, many names
many, many them. Interleukin 10 one anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6
one inflammatory. Anytime see IL-6, usually means
inflammatory response, wound, inflammation brain, somebody
either sleep deprived brain injury dealing sort infection.
IL-6 kind catch-all inflammation. appear iodine
supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated inflammation.
sense, iodine can anti-inflammatory effect. now, abundantly
clear. care thyroid hormone, care pathways impacts
like high level metabolism, guess no reason attractive
'cause can eat still maintain healthy body composition, also
brain health, cognitive function, tissue repair, stuff, keeping c-reactive protein low,
keeping IL-6 low, make sure getting enough iodine, selenium L-tyrosine.

00:41:00 & Increased Thyroid Increases Metabolism

curious thyroid actually increases metabolism, allows eat more,
et cetera. relates something covered last issue, glucose. Remember
eat something, blood sugar goes up, insulin secreted pancreas
makes sure blood glucose doesn't go high, can damage tissues


low, can make hypoglycemic. Thyroid increases glucose uptake various
tissues, particular muscle bone. actually can increase bone mineral density,
really good thing. get older, injuries, say older, mean basically
30 older, reason can recover quickly injuries
healthy thyroid healthy thyroid pathways can consume energy.
energy diverted toward bone repair muscle repair cartilage repair.
way increasing ATP. whole idea iodine,
selenium, L-tyrosine, allow thyroid healthy levels thyroid can take
glucose blood divert tissues used, particular brain.
things talking about, supplementing getting food,

00:42:12 Eat Support Brain

can actually improve support brain function. People always asking me,
food eat brain? Like, blueberries good brain?
ask me, walnuts good brain 'cause looks like brain? talked
earlier. fact matter need nutrients support hormones
biological pathways support brain. way think it. realized
people ask, eat support brain? basically
asking short form. keeping thyroid hormone healthy healthy levels is,
going terrific brain 75% metabolism brain.
ability brain use glucose ketones matter going aided
healthy thyroid. things, take things, eat things going
allow

00:43:00 Hyperthyroidism (Too Much) & Hypothyroidism (Too Little)

healthy levels thyroid hormone. sure number
wondering, healthy levels thyroid hormone? can measured
blood. telltale signs really high thyroid really low thyroid,
start listing off. easy find online well. Things like bulging
eyes, inability maintain weight, shaky, anxiety, kind hyperthyroidal, thinning
hair, kind thing. don't want get diagnosing hypothyroidism
hyperthyroidism. just impossible 'cause kind


shouting back forth tunnel video comments. concerned
excessively high excessively low levels thyroid hormone, absolutely
look symptoms are. Talk physician. number good
treatments. didn't talk prescription drugs can improve symptoms related
hypo hyperthyroid. course, synthesized thyroid. don't make
enough thyroid, can take thyroid, prescription. much thyroid,
sometimes take thyroid gland can administer drugs will either
block receptors will interfere pathways brain pituitary
pituitary thyroid order adjust thyroid hormone way.
big guns terms treatments different thyroid disorders
not talking thyroid disorders, talking get maintain thyroid
levels healthy ranges straightforward ways

00:44:35 Menstruation: Thyroid Carbohydrate & Sugar Craving

diet supplementation. also lot evidence people
menstruate, levels thyroid hormone can fluctuate dramatically across menstrual
cycle. really going process experimentation. don't know
could, could, theory, take blood different phases cycle figure
whether not thyroid hormone excessively high low different phases
cycle. going pretty tough do. endocrinologist
willing you, terrific. think people going figure
supplementing sorts things talked before, getting foods
relates different aspects cycle. general, first half cycle
ovulation, people crave carbohydrates sweets makes total sense
based biology menstrual cycle. Thyroid hormone going go you,
anyone, male female, menstruating not,

00:45:33 Ketogenic Diet & Effects Thyroid, Rebound Weight Gain

increases starchy carbohydrates. interesting ketogenic diets
shown slightly lower thyroid levels. makes sense ketogenic
diets, blood glucose levels low. thyroid hormone secreted large part
proportion much glucose bloodstream much glucose,


excuse me, needs regulated. not trying demonize ketogenic diet.
think definitely place. 22 studies now showing can dramatically
reduce blood glucose. third show thyroid hormone levels
slightly reduced, sometimes significantly, not more, ketogenic diet may
explain, want highlight may explain fact people go back
traditional diet ketogenic diet long time, oftentimes will
gain weight quickly bring carbohydrates back diet. people
cycling ketogenic non-ketogenic every three, four days. So-called
cyclical ketogenic diet. people staying ketogenic long periods time.
people six days on, one day off. huge variation there. point
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates particular, support healthy production
T3 T4. low carbohydrate, going reduction
T3 T4. going bring carbohydrates back diet,
might want gradually. menstruate, craving
carbohydrates early part cycle, actually associated
healthy cycle. healthy cycle ketogenic diet,
interesting. Maybe let know comments point direction
research aware it. can start see, really
beautiful interplay different hormones, insulin glucose,
estrogen thyroid, thyroid blood glucose ketogenic
diet. starts fit together ways make lot sense understand just
kind core elements hormones variety tissues
work on. simple version haven't carbohydrate year,
T3, T4 levels going pretty low. sure ketonistas
there. going say, wait, no, thyroid hormone levels go keto. might
true reasons, indirect reasons related hormone pathways
cascade ketosis long periods time. Great. people
don't consume carbohydrate, T3, T4 going go down. start
consume foods require thyroid metabolism order work with, metabolize,
weight gain can sometimes happen quickly. just something consider.
something work carefully going cyclic ketogenic, long-term
ketogenic. not ketogenic, consuming carbohydrates.
three things talked earlier, selenium, tyrosine iodine, chances
unless underlying condition



00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work
parallel. lumped together episode. increase
metabolism repair growth tissues. conversation growth hormone
incomplete didn't talk kind extremes. certain
people born don't make enough growth hormone, end
short stature. certain people make ton growth hormone
end very, large. tend large appendages.
something called acromegaly. kind like ridging forehead. actually
bone ridge. giant. used called giantism. people course
range height appendage length. doesn't imply growth
hormone disruption there. Growth hormone received lot attention
sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth
hormone. Today, going talk things anyone can increase
growth hormone. reasons certain people want that.
People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,


unquote, levels growth hormone might want

00:51:18 Growth Hormone (GH) Changes Across Lifespan & Risks GH Therapy

age puberty development, pituitary churning tons
growth hormone. responsible growth, not surprising, body
features. Height, just one those. age, make less growth
hormone. one reasons recover slowly injuries.
one reasons accumulate body fat. one reasons
metabolism slows. growth hormone replacement therapy tremendously
popular last 20 years, not say doesn't carry problems, does.
one major problems injecting growth hormone. Not saying people
shouldn't doctor approved keeping particular life
goals, growth hormone, levels high, will cause growth
tissues. not just muscle, not just reduction body fat metabolizing, know,
allowing fatty acids pulled storage used ATP, will also cause
increase growth heart lungs liver spleen.
concern abuse growth hormone. not going talking abuse
growth hormone. will, however, talk tools anyone can use increase
levels growth hormone. behavioral, supplement-
based interact behaviors supplements. cool
discussion growth hormone tools exist
increase growth hormone actionable. people can without
need equipment even supplement. Although supplement
related themes tools growth hormone increase. also increases one
can get growth hormone substantial. normally, talk
difference taking something exogenous substance like testosterone
estrogen versus using supplements behaviors increase them, talking
tenfold differences from, know, administering prescription compound. terms
growth hormone, things can increase growth hormone three, four, 500%
more. even though short-lived increase, can powerful effects
metabolism repair tissues.

00:53:40 Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know Natural TriggerS



talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth
hormone, chances things going benefit you. However, always,
want emphasize, talk doctor anything, including remove
treatments. anything add take away, responsibility
healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly
tissue repair, et cetera, need get slow-wave sleep so-called deep
sleep need blood insulin glucose relatively low. eating within two
hours sleep,

00:54:49 Not Eating Within 2hrs Sleep: Keep Blood Glucose Low(ish) Sleep

excuse me, eating within two hours going sleep going suppress growth
hormone release. clear. However, people going problems
falling asleep hungry. work decide
going eat. going eat thing not hungry
trouble falling asleep. episodes sleep covered
episodes two, three, four Huberman Lab Podcast has, believe, tools
ever want make use terms optimize sleep.
can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional
conversation. brain telling body hormones make. hormones
influencing tissues body also telling brain

all-meat diet, not sprinkling, not wrapping steaks
seaweed may may not supplementing iodine. Chances
probably consuming iodine salt requirements go not consuming
vegetables. People consuming vegetables kind interesting. always
hear cruciferous vegetables important
actually substances, compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables
can interfere thyroid hormone function. eating lot stuff, lot
cabbages just look other, think broccoli cruciferous vegetable,
won't read off whole list, just put internet. always told
eat lot dark, leafy green stuff. Well, unless dark, leafy green stuff kelp
seaweed, chances not getting enough iodine unless adding salt
food. chances may lowering total amount thyroid
making, well fact plant-rich diets, hard get enough L-tyrosine
don't want, know, not inflame vegans carnivore folks.
don't take stance either way that. just learning, trying report
science. point want make health important. purely plant-
based eating lot cruciferous vegetables, make sure getting
enough iodine. seem like cruciferous vegetables can increase need
iodine. thing purely all-meat diet keto,
not ingesting many vegetables. always thought cleaner diet,
better, turns probably true standpoint of, know, hormone
regulation, know, estrogen testosterone hormones. highly
processed foods really terrible. much evidence that. phthalates
plastics processed foods emulsifiers, stuff talked
previous episode, seem people not getting enough iodine
whatever reason, really need check whether not iodine levels need
increased fact consuming many plants many
meats cases, plants actually lower thyroid hormone. not beat

00:39:00 Benefits Iodine: Reducing Inflammation

number things iodine can positive sort of,

anti-inflammatory effect brings us back old friend, interleukin 6. Remember,
inflammatory cytokines. many, many names
many, many them. Interleukin 10 one anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6
one inflammatory. Anytime see IL-6, usually means
inflammatory response, wound, inflammation brain, somebody
either sleep deprived brain injury dealing sort infection.
IL-6 kind catch-all inflammation. appear iodine
supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated inflammation.

curious thyroid actually increases metabolism, allows eat more,
et cetera. relates something covered last issue, glucose. Remember
eat something, blood sugar goes up, insulin secreted pancreas
makes sure blood glucose doesn't go high, can damage tissues

00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work

sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth

growth hormone. reasons certain people want that.
People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,

00:53:40 Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know Natural TriggerS



talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth

want emphasize, talk doctor anything, including remove
treatments. anything add take away, responsibility
healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly
tissue repair, et cetera, need get slow-wave sleep so-called deep
sleep need blood insulin glucose relatively low. eating within two
hours sleep,

00:54:49 Not Eating Within 2hrs Sleep: Keep Blood Glucose Low(ish) Sleep

excuse me, eating within two hours going sleep going suppress growth

falling asleep hungry. work decide
going eat. going eat thing not hungry
trouble falling asleep. episodes sleep covered
episodes two, three, four Huberman Lab Podcast has, believe, tools
ever want make use terms optimize sleep.
can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid

can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding

00:39:00 Benefits Iodine: Reducing Inflammation

number things iodine can positive sort of,
related thyroid, not directly, kind offshoots thyroid pathway
downstream it, say, terms impact metabolic function.
One reduce something called c-reactive protein. may
heard CRP c-reactive protein. C-reactive protein something want
keep modestly low levels. associated inflammation various forms heart
disease even eye disease, macular degeneration. appear iodine
supplementation getting sufficient iodine food, either works, associated
reduced levels c-reactive protein blood anti-inflammatory effect.
anti-inflammatory effect brings us back old friend, interleukin 6. Remember,
inflammatory cytokines. many, many names
many, many them. Interleukin 10 one anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6
one inflammatory. Anytime see IL-6, usually means
inflammatory response, wound, inflammation brain, somebody
either sleep deprived brain injury dealing sort infection.
IL-6 kind catch-all inflammation. appear iodine
supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated inflammation.
sense, iodine can anti-inflammatory effect. now, abundantly
clear. care thyroid hormone, care pathways impacts
like high level metabolism, guess no reason attractive
'cause can eat still maintain healthy body composition, also
brain health, cognitive function, tissue repair, stuff, keeping c-reactive protein low,
keeping IL-6 low, make sure getting enough iodine, selenium L-tyrosine.

00:41:00 & Increased Thyroid Increases Metabolism

curious thyroid actually increases metabolism, allows eat more,
et cetera. relates something covered last issue, glucose. Remember
eat something, blood sugar goes up, insulin secreted pancreas
makes sure blood glucose doesn't go high, can damage tissues


low, can make hypoglycemic. Thyroid increases glucose uptake various
tissues, particular muscle bone. actually can increase bone mineral density,
really good thing. get older, injuries, say older, mean basically
30 older, reason can recover quickly injuries
healthy thyroid healthy thyroid pathways can consume energy.
energy diverted toward bone repair muscle repair cartilage repair.
way increasing ATP. whole idea iodine,
selenium, L-tyrosine, allow thyroid healthy levels thyroid can take
glucose blood divert tissues used, particular brain.
things talking about, supplementing getting food,

00:42:12 Eat Support Brain

can actually improve support brain function. People always asking me,
food eat brain? Like, blueberries good brain?
ask me, walnuts good brain 'cause looks like brain? talked
earlier. fact matter need nutrients support hormones
biological pathways support brain. way think it. realized
people ask, eat support brain? basically
asking short form. keeping thyroid hormone healthy healthy levels is,
going terrific brain 75% metabolism brain.
ability brain use glucose ketones matter going aided

00:44:35 Menstruation: Thyroid Carbohydrate & Sugar Craving

diet supplementation. also lot evidence people
menstruate, levels thyroid hormone can fluctuate dramatically across menstrual
cycle. really going process experimentation. don't know
could, could, theory, take blood different phases cycle figure
whether not thyroid hormone excessively high low different phases
cycle. going pretty tough do. endocrinologist
willing you, terrific. think people going figure

relates different aspects cycle. general, first half cycle
ovulation, people crave carbohydrates sweets makes total sense
based biology menstrual cycle. Thyroid hormone going go you,
anyone, male female, menstruating not,

00:45:33 Ketogenic Diet & Effects Thyroid, Rebound Weight Gain

increases starchy carbohydrates. interesting ketogenic diets
shown slightly lower thyroid levels. makes sense ketogenic
diets, blood glucose levels low. thyroid hormone secreted large part
proportion much glucose bloodstream much glucose,


excuse me, needs regulated. not trying demonize ketogenic diet.
think definitely place. 22 studies now showing can dramatically
reduce blood glucose. third show thyroid hormone levels
slightly reduced, sometimes significantly, not more, ketogenic diet may
explain, want highlight may explain fact people go back
traditional diet ketogenic diet long time, oftentimes will
gain weight quickly bring carbohydrates back diet. people
cycling ketogenic non-ketogenic every three, four days. So-called
cyclical ketogenic diet. people staying ketogenic long periods time.
people six days on, one day off. huge variation there. point
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates particular, support healthy production
T3 T4. low carbohydrate, going reduction
T3 T4. going bring carbohydrates back diet,
might want gradually. menstruate, craving
carbohydrates early part cycle, actually associated
healthy cycle. healthy cycle ketogenic diet,
interesting. Maybe let know comments point direction
research aware it. can start see, really
beautiful interplay different hormones, insulin glucose,
estrogen thyroid, thyroid blood glucose ketogenic
diet. starts fit together ways make lot sense understand just
kind core elements hormones variety tissues
work on. simple version haven't carbohydrate year,
T3, T4 levels going pretty low. sure ketonistas
there. going say, wait, no, thyroid hormone levels go keto. might
true reasons, indirect reasons related hormone pathways
cascade ketosis long periods time. Great. people
don't consume carbohydrate, T3, T4 going go down. start
consume foods require thyroid metabolism order work with, metabolize,
weight gain can sometimes happen quickly. just something consider.
something work carefully going cyclic ketogenic, long-term
ketogenic. not ketogenic, consuming carbohydrates.
three things talked earlier, selenium, tyrosine iodine, chances
unless underlying condition



00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work
parallel. lumped together episode. increase
metabolism repair growth tissues. conversation growth hormone
incomplete didn't talk kind extremes. certain
people born don't make enough growth hormone, end
short stature. certain people make ton growth hormone
end very, large. tend large appendages.
something called acromegaly. kind like ridging forehead. actually
bone ridge. giant. used called giantism. people course
range height appendage length. doesn't imply growth
hormone disruption there. Growth hormone received lot attention
sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth
hormone. Today, going talk things anyone can increase
growth hormone. reasons certain people want that.
People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,


unquote, levels growth hormone might want

00:51:18 Growth Hormone (GH) Changes Across Lifespan & Risks GH Therapy

age puberty development, pituitary churning tons
growth hormone. responsible growth, not surprising, body
features. Height, just one those. age, make less growth
hormone. one reasons recover slowly injuries.
one reasons accumulate body fat. one reasons
metabolism slows. growth hormone replacement therapy tremendously
popular last 20 years, not say doesn't carry problems, does.
one major problems injecting growth hormone. Not saying people
shouldn't doctor approved keeping particular life
goals, growth hormone, levels high, will cause growth
tissues. not just muscle, not just reduction body fat metabolizing, know,
allowing fatty acids pulled storage used ATP, will also cause
increase growth heart lungs liver spleen.
concern abuse growth hormone. not going talking abuse
growth hormone. will, however, talk tools anyone can use increase
levels growth hormone. behavioral, supplement-
based interact behaviors supplements. cool
discussion growth hormone tools exist
increase growth hormone actionable. people can without
need equipment even supplement. Although supplement
related themes tools growth hormone increase. also increases one
can get growth hormone substantial. normally, talk
difference taking something exogenous substance like testosterone
estrogen versus using supplements behaviors increase them, talking
tenfold differences from, know, administering prescription compound. terms
growth hormone, things can increase growth hormone three, four, 500%
more. even though short-lived increase, can powerful effects
metabolism repair tissues.

00:53:40 Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know Natural TriggerS



talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth
hormone, chances things going benefit you. However, always,
want emphasize, talk doctor anything, including remove
treatments. anything add take away, responsibility
healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly
tissue repair, et cetera, need get slow-wave sleep so-called deep
sleep need blood insulin glucose relatively low. eating within two
hours sleep,

00:54:49 Not Eating Within 2hrs Sleep: Keep Blood Glucose Low(ish) Sleep

excuse me, eating within two hours going sleep going suppress growth
hormone release. clear. However, people going problems
falling asleep hungry. work decide
going eat. going eat thing not hungry
trouble falling asleep. episodes sleep covered
episodes two, three, four Huberman Lab Podcast has, believe, tools
ever want make use terms optimize sleep.
can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional
conversation. brain telling body hormones make. hormones
influencing tissues body also telling brain

anyone, male female, menstruating not,

00:45:33 Ketogenic Diet & Effects Thyroid, Rebound Weight Gain

increases starchy carbohydrates. interesting ketogenic diets
shown slightly lower thyroid levels. makes sense ketogenic
diets, blood glucose levels low. thyroid hormone secreted large part
proportion much glucose bloodstream much glucose,


excuse me, needs regulated. not trying demonize ketogenic diet.
think definitely place. 22 studies now showing can dramatically
reduce blood glucose. third show thyroid hormone levels
slightly reduced, sometimes significantly, not more, ketogenic diet may
explain, want highlight may explain fact people go back
traditional diet ketogenic diet long time, oftentimes will
gain weight quickly bring carbohydrates back diet. people
cycling ketogenic non-ketogenic every three, four days. So-called
cyclical ketogenic diet. people staying ketogenic long periods time.
people six days on, one day off. huge variation there. point

00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work
parallel. lumped together episode. increase
metabolism repair growth tissues. conversation growth hormone
incomplete didn't talk kind extremes. certain
people born don't make enough growth hormone, end
short stature. certain people make ton growth hormone
end very, large. tend large appendages.
something called acromegaly. kind like ridging forehead. actually
bone ridge. giant. used called giantism. people course
range height appendage length. doesn't imply growth
hormone disruption there. Growth hormone received lot attention
sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth
hormone. Today, going talk things anyone can increase
growth hormone. reasons certain people want that.
People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,


unquote, levels growth hormone might want

00:51:18 Growth Hormone (GH) Changes Across Lifespan & Risks GH Therapy

age puberty development, pituitary churning tons
growth hormone. responsible growth, not surprising, body
features. Height, just one those. age, make less growth
hormone. one reasons recover slowly injuries.
one reasons accumulate body fat. one reasons
metabolism slows. growth hormone replacement therapy tremendously
popular last 20 years, not say doesn't carry problems, does.
one major problems injecting growth hormone. Not saying people
shouldn't doctor approved keeping particular life
goals, growth hormone, levels high, will cause growth
tissues. not just muscle, not just reduction body fat metabolizing, know,
allowing fatty acids pulled storage used ATP, will also cause
increase growth heart lungs liver spleen.
concern abuse growth hormone. not going talking abuse
growth hormone. will, however, talk tools anyone can use increase
levels growth hormone. behavioral, supplement-
based interact behaviors supplements. cool
discussion growth hormone tools exist
increase growth hormone actionable. people can without
need equipment even supplement. Although supplement
related themes tools growth hormone increase. also increases one
can get growth hormone substantial. normally, talk
difference taking something exogenous substance like testosterone
estrogen versus using supplements behaviors increase them, talking
tenfold differences from, know, administering prescription compound. terms
growth hormone, things can increase growth hormone three, four, 500%
more. even though short-lived increase, can powerful effects
metabolism repair tissues.

00:53:40 Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know Natural TriggerS



talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth
hormone, chances things going benefit you. However, always,
want emphasize, talk doctor anything, including remove
treatments. anything add take away, responsibility
healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly
tissue repair, et cetera, need get slow-wave sleep so-called deep
sleep need blood insulin glucose relatively low. eating within two
hours sleep,

00:54:49 Not Eating Within 2hrs Sleep: Keep Blood Glucose Low(ish) Sleep

excuse me, eating within two hours going sleep going suppress growth
hormone release. clear. However, people going problems
falling asleep hungry. work decide
going eat. going eat thing not hungry
trouble falling asleep. episodes sleep covered
episodes two, three, four Huberman Lab Podcast has, believe, tools
ever want make use terms optimize sleep.
can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional
conversation. brain telling body hormones make. hormones
influencing tissues body also telling brain

00:44:35 Menstruation: Thyroid Carbohydrate & Sugar Craving

diet supplementation. also lot evidence people
menstruate, levels thyroid hormone can fluctuate dramatically across menstrual
cycle. really going process experimentation. don't know
could, could, theory, take blood different phases cycle figure
whether not thyroid hormone excessively high low different phases
cycle. going pretty tough do. endocrinologist
willing you, terrific. think people going figure
supplementing sorts things talked before, getting foods
relates different aspects cycle. general, first half cycle
ovulation, people crave carbohydrates sweets makes total sense
based biology menstrual cycle. Thyroid hormone going go you,
anyone, male female, menstruating not,

00:45:33 Ketogenic Diet & Effects Thyroid, Rebound Weight Gain

increases starchy carbohydrates. interesting ketogenic diets
shown slightly lower thyroid levels. makes sense ketogenic
diets, blood glucose levels low. thyroid hormone secreted large part
proportion much glucose bloodstream much glucose,


excuse me, needs regulated. not trying demonize ketogenic diet.
think definitely place. 22 studies now showing can dramatically
reduce blood glucose. third show thyroid hormone levels
slightly reduced, sometimes significantly, not more, ketogenic diet may
explain, want highlight may explain fact people go back
traditional diet ketogenic diet long time, oftentimes will
gain weight quickly bring carbohydrates back diet. people
cycling ketogenic non-ketogenic every three, four days. So-called
cyclical ketogenic diet. people staying ketogenic long periods time.
people six days on, one day off. huge variation there. point
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates particular, support healthy production
T3 T4. low carbohydrate, going reduction
T3 T4. going bring carbohydrates back diet,
might want gradually. menstruate, craving
carbohydrates early part cycle, actually associated
healthy cycle. healthy cycle ketogenic diet,
interesting. Maybe let know comments point direction
research aware it. can start see, really
beautiful interplay different hormones, insulin glucose,
estrogen thyroid, thyroid blood glucose ketogenic
diet. starts fit together ways make lot sense understand just
kind core elements hormones variety tissues
work on. simple version haven't carbohydrate year,
T3, T4 levels going pretty low. sure ketonistas
there. going say, wait, no, thyroid hormone levels go keto. might
true reasons, indirect reasons related hormone pathways
cascade ketosis long periods time. Great. people
don't consume carbohydrate, T3, T4 going go down. start
consume foods require thyroid metabolism order work with, metabolize,
weight gain can sometimes happen quickly. just something consider.
something work carefully going cyclic ketogenic, long-term
ketogenic. not ketogenic, consuming carbohydrates.
three things talked earlier, selenium, tyrosine iodine, chances
unless underlying condition



00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work
parallel. lumped together episode. increase
metabolism repair growth tissues. conversation growth hormone
incomplete didn't talk kind extremes. certain
people born don't make enough growth hormone, end
short stature. certain people make ton growth hormone
end very, large. tend large appendages.
something called acromegaly. kind like ridging forehead. actually
bone ridge. giant. used called giantism. people course
range height appendage length. doesn't imply growth
hormone disruption there. Growth hormone received lot attention
sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth

growth hormone. reasons certain people want that.
People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,

talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels

healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly

slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close

00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work
parallel. lumped together episode. increase
metabolism repair growth tissues. conversation growth hormone
incomplete didn't talk kind extremes. certain
people born don't make enough growth hormone, end
short stature. certain people make ton growth hormone
end very, large. tend large appendages.
something called acromegaly. kind like ridging forehead. actually
bone ridge. giant. used called giantism. people course
range height appendage length. doesn't imply growth
hormone disruption there. Growth hormone received lot attention
sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth
hormone. Today, going talk things anyone can increase
growth hormone. reasons certain people want that.
People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,


unquote, levels growth hormone might want

one reasons accumulate body fat. one reasons
metabolism slows. growth hormone replacement therapy tremendously
popular last 20 years, not say doesn't carry problems, does.
one major problems injecting growth hormone. Not saying people

based interact behaviors supplements. cool
discussion growth hormone tools exist
increase growth hormone actionable. people can without
need equipment even supplement. Although supplement
related themes tools growth hormone increase. also increases one
can get growth hormone substantial. normally, talk
difference taking something exogenous substance like testosterone
estrogen versus using supplements behaviors increase them, talking
tenfold differences from, know, administering prescription compound. terms
growth hormone, things can increase growth hormone three, four, 500%
more. even though short-lived increase, can powerful effects
metabolism repair tissues.

00:53:40 Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know Natural TriggerS



talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth
hormone, chances things going benefit you. However, always,
want emphasize, talk doctor anything, including remove
treatments. anything add take away, responsibility
healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly
tissue repair, et cetera, need get slow-wave sleep so-called deep
sleep need blood insulin glucose relatively low. eating within two
hours sleep,

00:54:49 Not Eating Within 2hrs Sleep: Keep Blood Glucose Low(ish) Sleep

excuse me, eating within two hours going sleep going suppress growth
hormone release. clear. However, people going problems
falling asleep hungry. work decide
going eat. going eat thing not hungry
trouble falling asleep. episodes sleep covered
episodes two, three, four Huberman Lab Podcast has, believe, tools
ever want make use terms optimize sleep.
can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding

00:48:39 Growth Hormone: What, &

levels thyroid going healthy range. Next, going talk
growth hormone. Growth hormone received ton attention last 20
years. actually remember sequenced. huge deal.
huge patent drama. won't mention universities people involved.
companies monster patents payouts really interesting. can look
online interested scientific history. Growth hormone
pretty straightforward one understand now follows exact
logic thyroid hormone. fact, functions closely overlapping the,
know, first look face probably going think,
two systems? just briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
remember releasing means comes brain, comes brain tells
pituitary release growth hormone, growth hormone released
bloodstream goes acts ton tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et
cetera, increase metabolism. sounds just like thyroid hormone. work
parallel. lumped together episode. increase
metabolism repair growth tissues. conversation growth hormone
incomplete didn't talk kind extremes. certain
people born don't make enough growth hormone, end
short stature. certain people make ton growth hormone
end very, large. tend large appendages.
something called acromegaly. kind like ridging forehead. actually
bone ridge. giant. used called giantism. people course
range height appendage length. doesn't imply growth
hormone disruption there. Growth hormone received lot attention
sequenced meant opportunity inject growth hormone replace
growth hormone lost. actually lot cases people taking
kids trying get taller whatever reason injecting growth
hormone. Today, going talk things anyone can increase
growth hormone. reasons certain people want that.
People overproduce growth hormone certainly not want that. People
underproduce probably want that. People make normal, quote,


unquote, levels growth hormone might want

hormone. one reasons recover slowly injuries.
one reasons accumulate body fat. one reasons
metabolism slows. growth hormone replacement therapy tremendously
popular last 20 years, not say doesn't carry problems, does.
one major problems injecting growth hormone. Not saying people
shouldn't doctor approved keeping particular life
goals, growth hormone, levels high, will cause growth

based interact behaviors supplements. cool
discussion growth hormone tools exist
increase growth hormone actionable. people can without
need equipment even supplement. Although supplement
related themes tools growth hormone increase. also increases one
can get growth hormone substantial. normally, talk
difference taking something exogenous substance like testosterone
estrogen versus using supplements behaviors increase them, talking
tenfold differences from, know, administering prescription compound. terms
growth hormone, things can increase growth hormone three, four, 500%
more. even though short-lived increase, can powerful effects

00:53:40 Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know Natural TriggerS



talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth
hormone, chances things going benefit you. However, always,
want emphasize, talk doctor anything, including remove
treatments. anything add take away, responsibility
healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly
tissue repair, et cetera, need get slow-wave sleep so-called deep
sleep need blood insulin glucose relatively low. eating within two
hours sleep,

00:54:49 Not Eating Within 2hrs Sleep: Keep Blood Glucose Low(ish) Sleep

excuse me, eating within two hours going sleep going suppress growth
hormone release. clear. However, people going problems
falling asleep hungry. work decide
going eat. going eat thing not hungry
trouble falling asleep. episodes sleep covered
episodes two, three, four Huberman Lab Podcast has, believe, tools
ever want make use terms optimize sleep.
can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere

followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional
conversation. brain telling body hormones make. hormones
influencing tissues body also telling brain

talk those. Okay, go step step terms things anyone,
perhaps everyone, order maintain healthy growth hormone levels
increased growth hormone levels. Unless overproduction growth
hormone, chances things going benefit you. However, always,
want emphasize, talk doctor anything, including remove
treatments. anything add take away, responsibility
healthcare provider, okay? don't just say protect me, say protect
you. First all, growth hormone released every night go sleep
released early part sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep. two
conditions met order growth hormone secreted regularly
tissue repair, et cetera, need get slow-wave sleep so-called deep
sleep need blood insulin glucose relatively low. eating within two
hours sleep,

00:54:49 Not Eating Within 2hrs Sleep: Keep Blood Glucose Low(ish) Sleep

excuse me, eating within two hours going sleep going suppress growth
hormone release. clear. However, people going problems
falling asleep hungry. work decide
going eat. going eat thing not hungry
trouble falling asleep. episodes sleep covered
episodes two, three, four Huberman Lab Podcast has, believe, tools
ever want make use terms optimize sleep.
can refer those, like. don't eat close sleep get slow-wave
sleep. talked one earlier episodes, first half night,
slow-wave sleep deep sleep predominate. second half night, another
kind sleep, call REM sleep. special early phase sleep?
thinking listen podcast. thinking,
okay,

00:55:43 Delta Wave Brain Activity Trigger Growth Hormone Release

hear something important, related, pathway, mechanistically


say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional
conversation. brain telling body hormones make. hormones
influencing tissues body also telling brain

say get slow-wave sleep, get deep sleep, growth hormone
secreted. question asking scientists
wait, slow-wave sleep? particular slow-wave deep sleep allows
pituitary release growth hormone? Like, it? can understand
that, can understand little bit mechanism, actually ways can
increase amount growth hormone release sleep sleep.
answer delta wave activity brain. Delta waves big giant
waves activity brain correlate slow-wave sleep opposed faster
waves activity associated rapid eye movement sleep. slow-wave sleep
delta activity actually triggers neurons brain, releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons signal pituitary. Now,
know true? can this? Well, know true
researchers taken people sleep deprived them, just asked,
well, just one period time every 24 hours pituitary releases growth
hormone? case, say growth hormone just released
so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours pulse it, no, always
relating slow-wave deep sleep delta waves. cool
means even not measuring brainwaves sleep,
probably not, might measuring slow-wave sleep deep sleep using
device like Whoop Oura. even not, means
day, potential also increase growth hormone release can get
brain so-called delta waves. turns things can
waking well increase growth hormone release. going talk
next. tool just really make sure put brackets around this, try
blood glucose not high. need eat close bed, wouldn't
want eat anything increase blood glucose much. Try not eat
close bedtime. Get deep sleep early night. Get growth hormone
release. understand delta waves activity, sweeping big waves
activity neurons stimulate brain stimulate pituitary.
understand that, something anchor terms thinking
things can waking will allow release growth hormone
people going good thing.

00:58:25 LOW Doses Melatonin Supplementation Increasing GH Release



Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional
conversation. brain telling body hormones make. hormones
influencing tissues body also telling brain

Several times podcast, talked fact not big fan
melatonin supplementation purposes. might helpful conditions jet
lag. However, lot reasons personally don't like melatonin. interacts
reproductive hormones, testosterone estrogen, whole access
ways unattractive, least me. suppresses puberty development.
present much, much higher doses supplements one normally
make like hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today going talk instance
low levels melatonin supplementation might actually advantageous.
aiding transition delta wave, slow-wave sleep just described
pattern sleep brainwave activity triggers growth hormone
release. whereas melatonin supplements one milligram, three milligrams,
12 milligrams, kind thing, super physiological. data
showing microgram, maybe 500 micrograms melatonin, half milligram, can
beneficial shifting pattern early night's sleep toward slow-wave
deep sleep delta activity improving growth hormone release. Not lot studies
ones saw quality. done subjects that, know, sexes,
sufficient numbers, et cetera. interesting. interested melatonin
supplementation, might think just low levels. know, hundreds
micrograms opposed milligram dosages. ones going
milligram dosages. one way studies shown
can increase amount growth hormone secreted early phases sleep.
Now, delta wave activity slow-wave activity brain important
growth hormone release growth hormone release important
metabolic functions peeling away unwanted body fat repairing tissues, et
cetera, forces us ask, well, things can waking order increase
growth hormone release? start ones potentially big effect
little bit harder access. that, want point toward book, really
kind interesting. not focused growth hormone book called "Altered
Traits."

01:01:00 Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access

book. excellent book, "Altered Traits" Goleman Davidson.


"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional

"Science Reveals Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body."
interesting book. interested meditation, perhaps
not, considering it, talk book fact
meditation two separate lines effects. One lines effects things
change state. stressed. sit down, meditate relax
go particular state. changes occur time
changes trait. personality can actually change long bouts TM meditation
repeated meditation. case, reason talking "Altered Traits" today
certain types meditation can get people's brains states
closely mimic slow-wave sleep. hear snoring background, Costello is,
sounds like slow-wave sleep. big oscillatory snores 23.6 hours
per day. means people interested increasing growth
hormone, meditation practice allows get slow-wave delta type
frequency activity brain may beneficial mentioned before,
gating growth hormone release. not just circadian phenomenon,
actually controlled brainwaves. look binaural beats. get many
questions binaural beats really attractive idea, right? Binaural beats,
don't know, listen one frequency tone one ear another
frequency tone ear, brain essentially takes average
two wiring brainstem makes not quite average
takes average two sake discussion. frequency
brain entrains maps onto. lot apps claiming can get
brain delta waves using binaural beats. not find quality peer review
studies supporting that, know lot fans binaural beats.
know literature independent company makes binaural
beat technology, unbiased research, please send way. "Altered Traits,"
Goleman Davidson talk fact people 20 minutes sitting
meditation per day can access slow-wave sleep like brain states. Now, talked
lot non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra hypnosis. not
aware will put people slow-wave sleep per se, delta waves per se.
really talking 20 minutes traditional type meditation. Okay,
talked low doses melatonin way trigger delta waves
growth hormone release sleep. science support that. now talked
waking behavior 20 minutes sort call standard meditation


just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine

Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,

just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not

growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.

People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription

peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first

Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether

Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional

just sitting there, concentrating one's breathing try access delta waves.
Binaural beats, no science yet. knows? Maybe science support it.
aware it, let know. Now, move things one can
shown what's, just honest, pretty enormous effects growth
hormone release waking.

01:04:35 Specific Types & Duration Exercise Stimulate Growth Hormone &
Warmups

things actionable. One things can dramatic
effect levels growth hormone release waking well sleep following
night exercise. key type exercise duration. Now,
logic this. hundreds, not thousands studies measuring growth hormone,
sometimes exercise following night. conclusion
one takes away exercise particular duration
intensity order get growth hormone release. first just going tell
found maximum amount growth hormone release relates particular
form exercise. particular form exercise either weight training can
endurance training, endurance training weight training actually
limited 60 minutes, not much longer. Now, important
shown one exercises long weights endurance
exercise, cortisol levels go high enough starts inhibit testosterone
even estrogen pathways. believe people overexercise exercise
lot can lose menstrual cycles. stop menstruating. get
suppressions testosterone people train long hard. cutoff always
been, know, 60 75 minutes hard work part. going vary lot
person person, terms growth hormone, conditions seem lead
greatest growth hormone releases one, get warm. interesting, going
talk temperature. proper warmup seems accelerate release
growth hormone hard work phase starts. 10 minutes warmup
number extracted studies. beautiful review this,
way. Growth hormone responses varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine
exercise." talk arginine minutes. Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-
E-Y. published Current Opinion Clinical Nutrition Metabolic Care.


Current Opinion journals generally pretty high quality terms reviews just
tend pretty recent. references therein also quite
good. mean? means warm up. say warm up,
doesn't mean just warm limbs tissues going use don't
get injured, actually warm body. actually discussion
whether not cold winter months, people wear like stocking cap, bringing
conditions, making room warm. getting body warm warmup seems
important temperature body seems important condition
prerequisite certain patterns exercise maximize growth hormone release.
really interesting me. obsession body temperature, light exercise
food interact. going right fact get warm, bring
body temperature degree two maybe three, start exercise.
appear high-intensity exercise, discussed previous episode, not
exercise brings muscles failure close it. weight-bearing exercise,
getting close final repetitions can't complete not
pushing even going failure getting close leads anywhere
300 500% increases resting growth hormone levels 300 500% increases
growth hormone following night go sleep, incredible. Now,
want dissect properly. Okay, one conditions

01:08:40 Keeping Low Blood Glucose & Ensuring Cool Two Phase GH
Release

seem important, again, relatively low blood glucose.
looking lot like conditions need sleep order get maximum growth
hormone release sleep. not blood glucose high low,
discussion unto itself. want sufficient energy exercise getting
warm, not blood glucose high low. probably not eating close
exercise not ingesting lot sugars exercise. supported
fact ingestion sports drink contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line
growth hormone levels. really interesting relationship insulin, glucose
growth hormone. training anywhere 60 75 minutes
maximize growth hormone release. interesting thing even
exercise, taking body temperature back normal levels relatively quickly


seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth
hormone IGF-1. Men, keep going entire 60 minutes. don't tap
early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early

adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional
conversation. brain telling body hormones make. hormones
influencing tissues body also telling brain

seemed associated big spikes growth hormone. Otherwise,
happen get big spikes growth hormone, exercise went
long body temperature remained high long, didn't get
second increase growth hormone following night, okay? hope made
abundantly clear. Warm well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 75 minutes.
Don't go absolute failure interest growth hormone release
exercise later night. can bring body temperature back
normal levels cooling off, maybe cool shower maybe ice pack something,
maybe just turning off heat room going outside, whatever is,
increase probability going increase growth hormone following night
well. again, big increases, 300 500%. almost like getting
second sleep day. exercise hard, body temperature

01:10:36 Sex Differences Exercise Growth Hormone IGF-1
Release Occurs: Males Last Longer

stays high long, disrupt whole process don't get effect
increased growth hormone. Growth hormone really powerful doesn't work alone.
fact, lot effects growth hormone mediated effects liver.
growth hormone released, goes liver, liver releases something
called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 popular
neuroscience community area focus ability trigger
improvements memory learning exercise. indeed exercise triggers
release growth hormone IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible lot
effects improved memory. people report due increased number
neurons neurogenesis, birth new neurons. pretty clear humans, not
happening. Yes animals, not humans. IGF-1 nonetheless positive effects
memory cognition. great way trigger IGF-1 release growth hormone
release exercise. Now, interesting thing, reason bringing
IGF-1 certain patterns exercise, actually duration exercise
different effects IGF-1 growth hormone, depending whether not
exercise done men women. call sex-dependent effect.
sex-dependent effect follows. particular study several others,
people exercise. measured growth hormone IGF-1 levels


blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism

blood before, exercise. see greatest
increases occurred. standard sorts resistance exercise. squats.
sprint like activity. doesn't really matter specific exercises were.
None failure. kind 10 repetition less range, six
sets. kind standard weight training stuff anyone might do.
interesting women able access biggest peak growth hormone
IGF-1 early exercise. first 30 minutes. means even
just 30 minutes, least women, going big increase growth
hormone IGF-1 first 30 minutes. men, biggest increase occurred later
exercise, 60 minutes total. sex-dependent effects
interesting. point fact things like cortisol, testosterone, estrogen,
course vary different levels men women going impact
release things like IGF-1 growth hormone. yes, control sorts
things like diet controlled weight prior experience. actually quite
nice study. like check out, Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone
Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response Resistance Exercise
Sex-Dependent" Frontiers Endocrinology, fine journal 2020. quite recent.
mean? means exercising want growth hormone
release, warm up, type exercise discussing. Women,
first 30 minutes, going get maximum benefit terms growth

early interested getting growth hormone IGF-1 release.
conditions apply cooling not making

01:14:10 Supplements Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine,
Ornithine

exercise last long don't get increase growth hormone following
night. experience thus far podcast people fall one two
categories. just tell take people, people really
eager try supplements maybe prescription compounds.
people little bit shy supplementation. focused
can diet behaviors things sort. don't bias
either way. try offer tools supported scientific literature.


always point safety margins. supplements can increase growth
hormone considerable degree no, aren't growth hormone itself. Although,
course will increase growth hormone considerable degree. will talk
prescription drugs end, not just growth hormone, things
quite prominently use right now, particular entertainment industry.
pretty interesting compounds. first talk supplements.
known time arginine, amino acid arginine, well amino
acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine
number effects. can get food, can get supplements.
people take pill form capsule form. people will actually take IV,
intravenously. levels amounts arginine required get big growth
hormone release increases pretty substantial. people will take arginine
bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

bedtime, people will take exercise. prerequisite low
blood glucose. Blood glucose high, going quash effect. amounts
arginine people take anywhere three grams 10 grams, sometimes
even more. Although, definitely case not better. threshold
growth hormone release actually blunted taking nine grams
arginine. Now, nine grams arginine orally lot pills. minimum nine pills.
can cause GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. people will
throw up. people get constipation diarrhea, et cetera, just
stomachaches. certainly not suggesting people take arginine
reason studies looked role arginine growth
hormone levels IV, intravenous infusion. interesting, however,
whether not mouth vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth
hormone release levels amount increase anywhere 100
low-end anywhere basically 400 600% baseline.
huge increases growth hormone. Now, never tried arginine. Arginine
number different purposes. One increase growth hormone.
supplements increase growth hormone include arginine ornithine.
Arginine effect dilating arterials. basically increases blood
supply. arginine pathway involved vasodilation. actually pathway
downstream lot drugs used treat things like erectile dysfunction.
anytime people problems peripheral blood flow kind, focus
compounds will either disrupt enzymes will adjust levels amino acids


get vasodilation. taking arginine purpose increasing growth hormone
will also effect dilating blood vessels people blood, excuse me,

01:18:20 Arginine & Exercise Together Can Counter-Productive

heart conditions, actually can serious issue. Now, something really
important interesting note, increasing arginine levels specific
goal increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit effects
exercise growth hormone. Several studies looked at, looked interaction
taking arginine exercise just arginine just exercise alone.
don't, unfortunately, growth hormone increase goal, don't unfortunately
get increase growth hormone 800% taking arginine exercising. always
seems clamped 300 500% increases. Still large increases. make
point several reasons. First all, aware arginine effects
vasodilation. Take seriously heart condition take seriously
case. Second all, can supplement arginine, not exercise get
big increases growth hormone taking sleep. taking
arginine exercise, going short circuit clamp effects exercise
growth hormone, okay? something one use doesn't
synergistic effect exercise. two less cancel out, not zero,
end effect done one other.
hopefully clear. thing one's goal

01:19:50 L-Citrulline Better Arginine Arginine (?!); & Blood Pressure
Caution

really increase arginine blood whatever reason, arginine may not actually
best way that. way metabolized gut, doesn't
access get access tissues interested terms increasing
growth hormone vasodilation matter. case, something else
called L-citrulline powerful effects vasodilation, powerful effects potentially
growth hormone levels via arginine pathway. basically L-citrulline, acts
sort donor, kind biological prerequisite arginine can lead even
bigger arginine increases get took arginine itself. L-


citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid
Hormone



can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding
hormones powerful controlling way brain functions
interplay brain hormones really bidirectional
conversation. brain telling body hormones make. hormones
influencing tissues body also telling brain

life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
interested thyroid growth hormone pathways, brings close
month hormones. now hopefully understand not just thyroid growth
hormone logic underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, eat, stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin. names
don't mean anything you, perhaps go back listen episodes.
regardless, hope come away deeper understanding

citrulline there. Keep mind anything dilates blood vessels will lower
blood pressure. L-citrulline, yes, will lead increase blood flow whatever purpose
want use for, whether not pumps gym whatever. also can
lead big increases arginine growth hormone, will lower blood pressure.
aware that. understand biology isn't straightforward. L-citrulline
may actually better way get arginine increases arginine itself.
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although also indirect
pathway. nowadays, isn't lot focus ornithine way increase
growth hormone. kind rage 90s, not much anymore.
Nowadays, people really know stuff tend focus L-citrulline.
interested L-citrulline arginine, highly recommend go old
friend, good friends, examine.com, can put list. can
just put search totally free. will tell blood pressure will slightly
decreased. Power output gym will increase. strong effects blood
glucose. Fatigue reduced notably. Big increases nitric oxide. also related
increase vasodilation. Plasma arginine, high, excuse me, notable effects,
high support studies, allow people training volume, aerobic exercise,
arterial stiffness brought down. huge list things. Increase growth
hormone. two studies showing, done double-blind. Great, always want
see double-blind, placebo controlled. done males, not females.
Unfortunately, just data males increases growth hormone, small,
real significant effect. again, quality studies. huge number
effects there. kind interesting ones L-citrulline
might not thought things like muscle oxygenation scroll down,
decreases c-reactive protein. lot things might affect, expect,
excuse me, sorts compounds saw before. takeaway
want increase growth hormone, think arginine pathway, arginine
might not best direct route get there. L-citrulline might better option.

01:23:09 Growth Hormone Changes Across Lifespan: No One Escapes

please consider take seriously effects blood pressure.
talking big effects supplementation exercise growth hormone,
extremely powerful hormone. one thing note profile growth hormone


age, changes, mentioned earlier, important understand
changes. One thing particularly interesting somebody 40s
actually ages 30 40 amount growth hormone
release night reduced two threefold. really incredible. know,
hear much testosterone levels going age estrogen levels going
down. recall testosterone estrogen episode, talked
fact really look data, just instance, testosterone, men
90s not rare, turns out, making much testosterone
DHT, dihydrotestosterone, 20s, okay? hear much
nowadays testosterone levels dropping, sperm levels dropping, et
cetera. don't dispute that. talked episode. clear
testosterone levels vary tremendously person person. just getting older
not necessarily mean testosterone levels dropping. Growth hormone levels,
seems, dropping people 30s 40s dropping
substantially. seems case across board. just not going
find people 40s, 50s 60s making much growth hormone
teens 20s. somebody who, feel really good, somebody
definitely noticed got 40s even slept amount,
wasn't feeling quite say able recover exercise wound healing even
amount sleep. trying optimize great number things.
business growth hormone became particular interest me. since
ways manipulate growth hormone men women straightforward.
since everybody goes age-related decline dramatically, seems
things supposed anyway, like exercising, like trying not
eat close bedtime, trying optimize sleep. wonderful tools
pursuing perhaps using. can actually offset two three fold
decrease, right? talking two threefold decrease people
30s 40s. talking increases exercise maybe
supplementation certainly exercise 300 500%. Well, then, sudden
position actually offset age-related decline

01:26:00 Heat (& Cold) Triggering Extremely Large Increases Growth Hormone

growth hormone completely just behaviors. think quite interesting


quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription

quite powerful. Now, like discuss way anyone can increase levels
growth hormone dramatically. say dramatically, mean dramatically.
get numbers couple minutes. remember growth hormone
released first place. Remember, starts brain, hypothalamus.
hypothalamus brain area controls things like sexual behavior, temperature
regulation, circadian behavior, meaning want awake want
asleep, aggression, that. brain areas involved
rich collection different neurons involved basic functions. Now,
talked releasing hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone, comes
neurons hypothalamus. communicate pituitary
pituitary releases growth hormone growth hormone acts
different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat. Makes use energy.
lose body fat growth hormone levels high. makes grow
muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera. Now, one things profound effect
growth hormone levels, growth hormone release, temperature. Now, data
strong data come animal studies human studies.
number studies explored making animals cold hot can
increase growth hormone. guessing direction going go,
can probably imagine making animals people warmer way go want
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime going increase temperature
anyone else animal, risky. want really clear this. Not
everyone engage behaviors describe. just say
reason risky doesn't take much temperature increase brain cook
brain, cook neurons. point, neurons can't come back. people can
die hyperthermia. much greater range terms cold. can also die
hypothermia. can freeze death. much greater range getting
cold warming brain. However, really strong data pointing
fact sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not high, however, sauna can
increase release growth hormone hormones. dramatic
literature size effects reported. first all, talk
temperature increases. yes, will refer things people can
even don't sauna realized not everybody sauna
backyard access sauna. first all, recall study exercise
warming degrees exercise led bigger quicker increases


growth hormone exercise itself. already point direction
temperature important.

01:29:20 Specific Heat Protocols Increasing Growth Hormone: 16-Fold (?!)

Now, degrees, no pun intended, talking increasing body
temperature entering saunas somewhere 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, 80 degrees Celsius, way like 210, 215 degrees
Fahrenheit. personally know people go even higher trained
deal high heats. again, high heat dangerous. must
clear doctor. Now, happens high heat? couple things happen
high heat. First all, start getting bigger stroke volume heart. Kind like
exercise. get well-trained endurance activity, stroke volume
amount blood heart can pump time gets larger. dilate blood
vessels, right? lot things happen also. sweating. body's
trying unload heat. Dilation blood vessels, arginine, increases heat.
starting see hear common theme. appears getting into, not saying
getting body 212 degrees Fahrenheit, want clear, not talking
getting body 100 degrees Celsius. terrible. die.
entering environments hot short periods time, anywhere
20 minutes 30 minutes, temperature 80 degrees Celsius 100 degrees
Celsius 175 degrees Fahrenheit, less, 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
less, shown increase growth hormone release 16 fold. right,
16 fold. 1,600%. Now, also effects hormones, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. pattern described study there've
many studies now. Endocrine effects repeated sauna done 17 humans.
repeatedly. wasn't first time this.
three days row. pattern get sauna 20 minutes,
followed 30-minute cooling period. Remember, don't want spend long
periods time high heat. can cook brain tissues. careful
approach decide to. 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
followed 30 minutes cooling, followed 20 minutes sauna again, led five fold
increase growth hormone. day day day, third
day, see huge increases like 16 fold, 16 fold.


now many studies like this. described years ago, since then, there've
number studies pointed direction deliberate
hyperthermia, not hot kill order increase growth hormone.
know keep highlighting dangers there, again, anytime going
mess heat, cautious, careful. standard sauna can
useful. don't access sauna, one way people this,
look friends, wrestlers, right? wear plastics, basically bodysuits
fairly inexpensive can buy online purchase platform,
say. people old days plastic things readily
available. actually knew people wrapped garbage bags
throw sweats hoodie go jog. Again, really
careful, especially hot day. Overheating can equate death. another way
heat up. don't actually need sauna. known people will hotel
rooms traveling. turn heat, know, make hot bath.
won't actually get bath fill room steam heat put
hoodie sweatshirt, sweat pants, sit wool socks
get warm 20 minutes, take cool shower,
again. guess hotel paying water bill, don't worry much.
people course saunas. lot ways that. friends
military made saunas cars overseas.
sorts things. careful. know said many, many times. just
don't want anyone hurt themselves. increases growth hormone
tremendous. probably stem increased activity neurons within
hypothalamus stimulate growth hormone release pituitary.
probably growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons hypothalamus
sit closely may even intermixed neurons
hypothalamus regulate heat body temperature. Remember, metabolism
impart heat. like furnace much energy consuming using
building energy usage purposes. sauna can very, interesting.
again, 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed extreme
caution, nonetheless, pretty extreme effects terms abilities

01:34:30 2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects
Testosterone, DHEA Prolactin



increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

01:42:25 Synthesis, Summary Actionable Steps Increasing GH Thyroid

can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not

increase growth hormone levels. Along lines temperature hormones, just
want mention recent study, just came out. March, April, 2021, "Endocrine
Effects Repeated Hot Thermal Stress Cold Water Immersion Young Adult
Men." Unfortunately, just men, didn't look women, nonetheless
think data relevant everybody general theme. Podstawski et al.
will put link study caption looked testosterone, prolactin,
cortisol, et cetera. found sauna indeed lead
significant decrease cortisol, stress hormone, hormone want
released early day wake up. sauna definitely led significant
decrease cortisol not change testosterone, DHEA prolactin levels.
interesting. turns cold affect hormones
results little bit mixed. takeaway heat seems
positive effects growth hormone, big effects. seems positive effects
reducing cortisol levels. not seem effects things like testosterone,
DHEA, prolactin directly. can imagine shift hormone going alter
levels hormones lines indirect effects terms direct
effects just

01:36:00 Prescription Growth Hormone, & Emerging Peptides Therapeutics,
Secretagogues Etc.

immediately sauna bath, no effects. talked diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools. course, talked underlying biology
logic. hopefully heard safety precautions those. Now, like
just briefly talk prescription side this. are, know, many
people taking growth hormone prescribed doctor.
presumably people taking growth hormone even though not
prescribed doctor, none business. point
hormones make synthesized. versions
little bottles little ampules people can inject. couple important things
consider going go route. First all, talk physician, right?
actually legally available physician. Second all, anytime
injecting something, going shut production. way


hormone system works. take thyroid hormone, won't make thyroid
hormone, least long run. take testosterone, will shut
production testosterone. take estrogen, system's little resilient
eventually will shut production estrogen. true
growth hormone. decision go route taking something often not always
decision forever. However, willing sustain period without
given hormone, people can things stop taking them, wait
period not making testosterone, estrogen growth hormone,
will come back, sometimes sometimes won't. kind new area
developing now think deserves attention, not encouraging it,
happening. keeping science keeping trying
keep things modern, worth us discussing. peptides. days
hear lot peptides. like clarify little bit peptides are.
Peptides really huge category biological compounds. Peptides just strings
amino acids, right? talked L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
amino acids. individual amino acids. put together little
small peptides called polypeptides, just longer peptides.
turns substance like growth hormone growth hormone-releasing
hormone, made different amino acids different sequences, just like
genes made Gs Cs Ts, nucleotides different sequences.
like recipe. Peptides tend short sequences amino acids resemble
hormone enough resemble peptide enough can lead similar
effects inject them. example, make growth hormone-releasing
hormone brain stimulates growth hormone pituitary.
probably getting tired saying now. people now will take things like
sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin, not entire peptide sequence
growth hormone-releasing hormone subset those. people inject
go sleep night typically done empty stomach.
stimulates release growth hormone pituitary. not taking
growth hormone, taking stimulating hormone often called
secretagogue mimic, right? causes secretion hormone one wants.
People will thyroid hormone, too. people prescription
real medical need. people just longevity reasons, kind
falls gray zone wouldn't die without it, want enhance


life believe right thing them,
prescription. Sermorelin prescription. work? Yes. shut
natural production growth hormone-releasing hormone? Well, there, answer yes
peptides actually effect changing gene expression.
Remember, way back beginning talking hormones, can
actually change gene expression can actually set pathways motion
continued production hormone even stop taking compound. Now, can
good can bad recall, growth hormone, big increases
growth hormone short-lived like sauna, or, know, say exercise
arginine sauna, seems like huge effects. early nights, know, first
phase sleep early night, sorts things. transient.
one injecting constant level, can put action gene expression
programs can long lived. say, particular tumor body.
Tumors will grow see growth hormone even tumor unhealthy you,
right? got growth tissues body. again, not saying whether
not people things not them. One thing know
prominent use movie industry. People want peel off body fat
quickly, increase recovery time. increase healing rates. People also
injecting things like gastric peptides. actually stomach peptides talked
previous episode, things related ghrelin pathway things
liver can improve rate tissue wound healing. can bet
upcoming Olympics, lot people using peptides compounds not
pointing fingers anyone particular. just separate hormone
augmentation like injecting GH injecting testosterone. People now working
pathways. names peptides things like ipamorelin,
tesamorelin. clinical uses. Others just made
compounds people kind longevity field self-augmentation field,
will. again, not promoting use definitely there. now
hear someone's talking them, now hopefully
better understanding underlying biology.

can think rationally whether not right decision you.
Okay, again, covered enormous amount material. Hopefully, now
understand thyroid hormone little bit mechanism
maybe lot growth hormone take care
metabolism. dictate many nutrients can eat make use of. can
pull body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. really incredible
compounds. actionable. things can do, like getting early
phase sleep, perhaps supplementing arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting
adequate exercise, warming properly, not making exercise long intense
will help, maybe sauna things like it. know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
emphasis safe, might things use. Regardless, even not
