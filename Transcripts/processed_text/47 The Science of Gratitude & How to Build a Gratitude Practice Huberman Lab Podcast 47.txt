worth us taking step back asking, medial prefrontal cortex really do,
right? one piece neural real estate right behind

involved

00:25:10 Prefrontal Cortex Set Context

many different things, reason especially important gratitude
medial prefrontal cortex sets context, okay? sets context literally defines
meaning experience. Now not abstract phenomenon. going
give physiological example this, going translate gratitude.
really want everyone understand, medial prefrontal cortex sets
context everything life? Well, following way. number
circuits deeper brain simply create sensations allow you,
say, perceive certain sensations. use example cold exposure,

00:30:10 Ineffective Gratitude Practices; Autonomic Variables

lie whether not experience actually good
not, brain knows. effective gratitude practice look like? Well,
examine ineffective, poor gratitude practice looks like.
therein lies really important information, including fact I, think millions
people wrong. gratitude practices see online
people talk various talks forth involves something like writing
reciting, thinking five 10 three 20 things especially
grateful for. really trying feel those, really try think deeply

pro-social neural networks talking earlier. Now may come
surprise many you, certainly came surprise me.
evidence shift so-called autonomic arousal gratitude
practices, ones calling ineffective, can made slightly
effective. mean shift autonomic arousal? Well, briefly

00:25:10 Prefrontal Cortex Set Context

many different things, reason especially important gratitude
medial prefrontal cortex sets context, okay? sets context literally defines
meaning experience. Now not abstract phenomenon. going
give physiological example this, going translate gratitude.
really want everyone understand, medial prefrontal cortex sets
context everything life? Well, following way. number
circuits deeper brain simply create sensations allow you,
say, perceive certain sensations. use example cold exposure,
something sometimes talk podcast, reasons.

examine ineffective, poor gratitude practice looks like.
therein lies really important information, including fact I, think millions
people wrong. gratitude practices see online

surprise many you, certainly came surprise me.
evidence shift so-called autonomic arousal gratitude

worth us taking step back asking, medial prefrontal cortex really do,
right? one piece neural real estate right behind

00:25:10 Prefrontal Cortex Set Context

many different things, reason especially important gratitude
medial prefrontal cortex sets context, okay? sets context literally defines
meaning experience. Now not abstract phenomenon. going
give physiological example this, going translate gratitude.
really want everyone understand, medial prefrontal cortex sets
context everything life? Well, following way. number
circuits deeper brain simply create sensations allow you,
say, perceive certain sensations. use example cold exposure,
something sometimes talk podcast, reasons.

not, brain knows. effective gratitude practice look like? Well,
examine ineffective, poor gratitude practice looks like.
therein lies really important information, including fact I, think millions
people wrong. gratitude practices see online
people talk various talks forth involves something like writing
reciting, thinking five 10 three 20 things especially

Now like talk neurochemistry neural circuits associated
gratitude pro-social behaviors. Numerous times podcast, talked
so-called neuromodulators. might've forgotten never heard
neuromodulators before, neuromodulators chemicals released brain
body change activity neural circuits. make certain brain areas
likely active brain areas less likely active.
neuromodulators names like dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, epinephrin,
on. main neuromodulators associated gratitude pro-social behaviors
tends serotonin. Serotonin released small collection neurons
brainstem called raphe, R-A-P-H-E, raphe nucleus, places

hmm, like experience this, hmm, feels really good.
literally feed onto muscles via neurons, making happy stay stationary,
experiencing something like, move closer something find
attractive literally. powerful circuits. two brain areas,
one like focus medial prefrontal cortex. Many
probably heard medial prefrontal cortex, area brain
involved planning deep thinking evaluation different types
experiences, past, present, future. seems actually pretty much every study
human anything seems involve medial prefrontal cortex, least one get
impression just looking scientific abstracts papers days. think
worth us taking step back asking, medial prefrontal cortex really do,
right? one piece neural real estate right behind
forehead, involved many different things? reason can
involved

00:25:10 Prefrontal Cortex Set Context

many different things, reason especially important gratitude
medial prefrontal cortex sets context, okay? sets context literally defines
meaning experience. Now not abstract phenomenon. going
give physiological example this, going translate gratitude.
really want everyone understand, medial prefrontal cortex sets
context everything life? Well, following way. number
circuits deeper brain simply create sensations allow you,
say, perceive certain sensations. use example cold exposure,
something sometimes talk podcast, reasons.
deliberately place ice bath, uncomfortable, even
adapted cold forth. discomfort non-negotiable. However,
want to, knowledge particular
health benefits, medial prefrontal cortex can control areas deeper brain,
like hypothalamus, positively impact neurochemicals released
system. still get lot adrenaline getting ice bath. fact


deliberately, knowledge making choice,
deciding put discomfort, shown
create different positive effect things like dopamine, things like anti-
inflammatory markers, immune system, et cetera, compared someone
pushes ice bath, someone insists
really, really don't want to. subtle distinction here. just
distinction motivation desire, lack motivation forced
something. number effects described.
episode Robert Sapolsky earlier last year, talked study
animals, also shown humans. take mouse instance,
runs running wheel, mice really like do, many positive effects
reducing blood pressure, improvements neurochemistry, et cetera, mouse.
However, mouse cage right next trapped running
wheel run every time mouse runs 'cause wheels linked,
well, second mouse forced exact running experiences
negative shifts overall health metrics. Blood pressure goes up, stress hormones
go up, et cetera, not actually making choice. Medial prefrontal cortex
knob, switch rather, can take one experience allow us frame
creates positive health effects. exact experience framed
something don't want do, forced can create negative health
effects. Now exactly neurons medial prefrontal cortex rather
complicated, frankly not completely understood. somehow able adjust
activity neural circuits purely reflexive. say, neuroscience, like
really dumb neural circuits, just like switches, place context onto it. So,
gratitude mindset activates prefrontal cortex, sets context
experience can derive tremendous health benefits. leads us
question; kind gratitude practice going accomplish this, right?
not simply case take knife, don't please, don't experiment,
cut hand say, oh, know, going enjoy this. 'cause
good won't hurt. course it'll hurt, just like ice bath cold, no matter
what. can't lie myself, right? knowledge cutting bad
me, hard override. so, medial prefrontal cortex

can't simply lie yourself. can't simply say, oh, well, every experience


learning experience, terrible thing happens, oh, good, just going say good,
body will react good you. myth. frankly, myth
fairly pervasive self-help self-actualization literature.
opportunity reframe set context experiences. requires
specific set practices. can't simply lie quote unquote, fake
make it. Neural circuitry powerful plastic. can modified
context-dependent, not stupid.

00:30:10 Ineffective Gratitude Practices; Autonomic Variables

lie whether not experience actually good
not, brain knows. effective gratitude practice look like? Well,
examine ineffective, poor gratitude practice looks like.
therein lies really important information, including fact I, think millions
people wrong. gratitude practices see online
people talk various talks forth involves something like writing
reciting, thinking five 10 three 20 things especially
grateful for. really trying feel those, really try think deeply
emotions, sensations, perceptions associated
particular people, places things list. studies actually point fact
style gratitude practice not particularly effective shifting neural
circuitry, neural chemistry, somatic circuitry, circuits body, 'cause
literally organs neural circuits connected, circuits brain
body toward enhanced activation prefrontal cortex, enhanced activation
pro-social neural networks talking earlier. Now may come
surprise many you, certainly came surprise me.
evidence shift so-called autonomic arousal gratitude
practices, ones calling ineffective, can made slightly
effective. mean shift autonomic arousal? Well, briefly
aspect nervous system, within brain body call
autonomic nervous system. little bit misnomer autonomic means
automatic. fact, can take control autonomic nervous system. one
branch, meaning one set connections circuits associated making us
alert, so-called sympathetic nervous system, say sympathetic arm


autonomic nervous system, really mouthful. really associated
enhanced alertness kind excitement fear, nothing
sympathy. just enhanced alertness. arm autonomic
nervous system so-called parasympathetic arm autonomic nervous system.
also mouthful. just say calming aspect autonomic
nervous system. associated decreased heart rate, decreased breathing rate,
et cetera. two aspects, autonomic nervous system,
shown people brought state heightened sympathetic tone,
meaning alertness, intensity emotions experience
gratitude practice enhanced, effectiveness gratitude practice can
enhanced. seen nowadays somewhat commonly people, instance,
cyclic hyperventilated breathing, call laboratory. Breathing
intense that, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale deeply 25 30 breaths.
people will sit meditative stance, focus notepad paper.
write things grateful for. really try feel
things, think things. makes perfect sense
enhancing autonomic arousal toward alertness create robust feelings
robust impact gratitude practices, state,
alert therefore able bring detail, richness perception
understanding things list happened be.
say numerous approaches this. Sort self-help type stuff self
actualization seminars. People will things like cold baths, chanting,
number different experiences mainly geared towards
increased autonomic arousal. even practices using pharmacology
create increased autonomic arousal drop gratitude. Across board,
increase potency gratitude practice listing things paper

Now like talk neurochemistry neural circuits associated
gratitude pro-social behaviors. Numerous times podcast, talked
so-called neuromodulators. might've forgotten never heard
neuromodulators before, neuromodulators chemicals released brain
body change activity neural circuits. make certain brain areas
likely active brain areas less likely active.
neuromodulators names like dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, epinephrin,
on. main neuromodulators associated gratitude pro-social behaviors
tends serotonin. Serotonin released small collection neurons
brainstem called raphe, R-A-P-H-E, raphe nucleus, places
brain. raphe neuron send little wires call axons
numerous places brain. tend increase activity particular
neurocircuits lend approach particular types experiences.

certain experiences. areas active, certain thought
processes get invoked. thought processes probably resemble something like,
hmm, like experience this, hmm, feels really good.
literally feed onto muscles via neurons, making happy stay stationary,
experiencing something like, move closer something find
attractive literally. powerful circuits. two brain areas,
one like focus medial prefrontal cortex. Many
probably heard medial prefrontal cortex, area brain
involved planning deep thinking evaluation different types
experiences, past, present, future. seems actually pretty much every study
human anything seems involve medial prefrontal cortex, least one get
impression just looking scientific abstracts papers days. think
worth us taking step back asking, medial prefrontal cortex really do,
right? one piece neural real estate right behind
forehead, involved many different things? reason can
involved

00:25:10 Prefrontal Cortex Set Context

many different things, reason especially important gratitude
medial prefrontal cortex sets context, okay? sets context literally defines
meaning experience. Now not abstract phenomenon. going
give physiological example this, going translate gratitude.
really want everyone understand, medial prefrontal cortex sets
context everything life? Well, following way. number
circuits deeper brain simply create sensations allow you,
say, perceive certain sensations. use example cold exposure,
something sometimes talk podcast, reasons.
deliberately place ice bath, uncomfortable, even
adapted cold forth. discomfort non-negotiable. However,
want to, knowledge particular
health benefits, medial prefrontal cortex can control areas deeper brain,
like hypothalamus, positively impact neurochemicals released
system. still get lot adrenaline getting ice bath. fact


deliberately, knowledge making choice,
deciding put discomfort, shown
create different positive effect things like dopamine, things like anti-
inflammatory markers, immune system, et cetera, compared someone
pushes ice bath, someone insists
really, really don't want to. subtle distinction here. just
distinction motivation desire, lack motivation forced
something. number effects described.
episode Robert Sapolsky earlier last year, talked study
animals, also shown humans. take mouse instance,
runs running wheel, mice really like do, many positive effects
reducing blood pressure, improvements neurochemistry, et cetera, mouse.
However, mouse cage right next trapped running
wheel run every time mouse runs 'cause wheels linked,
well, second mouse forced exact running experiences
negative shifts overall health metrics. Blood pressure goes up, stress hormones
go up, et cetera, not actually making choice. Medial prefrontal cortex
knob, switch rather, can take one experience allow us frame
creates positive health effects. exact experience framed
something don't want do, forced can create negative health
effects. Now exactly neurons medial prefrontal cortex rather
complicated, frankly not completely understood. somehow able adjust
activity neural circuits purely reflexive. say, neuroscience, like
really dumb neural circuits, just like switches, place context onto it. So,
gratitude mindset activates prefrontal cortex, sets context
experience can derive tremendous health benefits. leads us
question; kind gratitude practice going accomplish this, right?
not simply case take knife, don't please, don't experiment,
cut hand say, oh, know, going enjoy this. 'cause
good won't hurt. course it'll hurt, just like ice bath cold, no matter
what. can't lie myself, right? knowledge cutting bad
me, hard override. so, medial prefrontal cortex
tremendous capacity set context. beautifully respect gratitude.
can't simply lie yourself. can't simply say, oh, well, every experience


learning experience, terrible thing happens, oh, good, just going say good,
body will react good you. myth. frankly, myth
fairly pervasive self-help self-actualization literature.
opportunity reframe set context experiences. requires
specific set practices. can't simply lie quote unquote, fake
make it. Neural circuitry powerful plastic. can modified
context-dependent, not stupid.

00:30:10 Ineffective Gratitude Practices; Autonomic Variables

lie whether not experience actually good
not, brain knows. effective gratitude practice look like? Well,
examine ineffective, poor gratitude practice looks like.
therein lies really important information, including fact I, think millions
people wrong. gratitude practices see online
people talk various talks forth involves something like writing
reciting, thinking five 10 three 20 things especially
grateful for. really trying feel those, really try think deeply
emotions, sensations, perceptions associated
particular people, places things list. studies actually point fact
style gratitude practice not particularly effective shifting neural
circuitry, neural chemistry, somatic circuitry, circuits body, 'cause
literally organs neural circuits connected, circuits brain
body toward enhanced activation prefrontal cortex, enhanced activation
pro-social neural networks talking earlier. Now may come
surprise many you, certainly came surprise me.
evidence shift so-called autonomic arousal gratitude
practices, ones calling ineffective, can made slightly
effective. mean shift autonomic arousal? Well, briefly
aspect nervous system, within brain body call
autonomic nervous system. little bit misnomer autonomic means
automatic. fact, can take control autonomic nervous system. one
branch, meaning one set connections circuits associated making us
alert, so-called sympathetic nervous system, say sympathetic arm


autonomic nervous system, really mouthful. really associated
enhanced alertness kind excitement fear, nothing
sympathy. just enhanced alertness. arm autonomic
nervous system so-called parasympathetic arm autonomic nervous system.
also mouthful. just say calming aspect autonomic
nervous system. associated decreased heart rate, decreased breathing rate,
et cetera. two aspects, autonomic nervous system,
shown people brought state heightened sympathetic tone,
meaning alertness, intensity emotions experience
gratitude practice enhanced, effectiveness gratitude practice can
enhanced. seen nowadays somewhat commonly people, instance,
cyclic hyperventilated breathing, call laboratory. Breathing
intense that, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale deeply 25 30 breaths.
people will sit meditative stance, focus notepad paper.
write things grateful for. really try feel
things, think things. makes perfect sense
enhancing autonomic arousal toward alertness create robust feelings
robust impact gratitude practices, state,
alert therefore able bring detail, richness perception
understanding things list happened be.
say numerous approaches this. Sort self-help type stuff self
actualization seminars. People will things like cold baths, chanting,
number different experiences mainly geared towards
increased autonomic arousal. even practices using pharmacology
create increased autonomic arousal drop gratitude. Across board,
increase potency gratitude practice listing things paper

one needs put mindset another directly receive gratitude.
just take moment start think going build
ultimate gratitude practice; meaning effective gratitude practice us
many positive effects effective gratitude practice can have,
proper one. clear receiving gratitude powerful, also
clear waiting around receive gratitude impractical approach. Now,

don't want take anything away important work Kelly others
done. absence people practices with,
know sure real experience somebody else's experience.
best way story. So, thinking build

really means circuits gratitude can exchange gratitude.
can actually observe someone else getting help, someone else giving help.
observation species one another, allows us experience feeling
genuine chemical neural circuit activation lift, will. Very, different
simply writing things thankful for, right? so,
this? Well, people digest story number different ways. People watch movies,
people listen podcasts, people read books. tremendous number stories
there. clear effective gratitude practice repeated time
time. not suggest build protocol constantly
foraging inspirational stories again. Social media internet
replete those. not going potent protocol tool,
potent protocol tool gratitude going one repeat
again. Rather, effective protocol tool going either think into,
write like, think somebody thankful
something did, really start think felt receiving
gratitude, and/or say, imagining thinking deeply emotional
experience somebody else receiving help. Now, narrative select going
dependent taste. going dependent
resonates you. again, want emphasize story select
not semblance life experience, just happens
move you. so, way one this, actually started
practice basis learnings last weeks around
preparing episode, find story particularly meaningful you.
just take short notes, bullet point notes maybe list instance,
just small sheet paper phone, preference, just list
instance, know, struggle was, help was, something


impacts emotionally, okay? something just you. don't
share anybody. kind shorthand list bullet point notes serves
shorthand getting mode calling gratitude. actually closely
mimics lot done various studies. even though
studies talked now, really focused call acute imaging

called neuroplasticity circuits. Neuroplasticity brain nervous system's

probably presume that. receiving genuine thanks also strong variable
determining whether not experience real gratitude, whether not empty,

remarkable thing one can shift circuits direction think people
like; sense wellbeing motivation less resentment


fear literally. really cool study also interventions
five minutes long. incredible, five minutes long. so, start build
ideal gratitude practice, know certain features. First all,
grounded story, probably story heard entirety least once.
can shorthand version, so-called bullet points talked
allow drop story emotional associations story.
don't listen whole story time. story one
genuinely thanked something made feel good,
story someone else genuinely expressing thanks, okay? Based
description gratitude practices talked earlier. gratitude practice
can brief. mean, brief one minute, 60 seconds, five minutes,
still seems brief me. Although studies, getting
really major effects just five minutes gratitude practice. papers
involve people focusing breathing calming
go gratitude practice, within five minute block. decide
going gratitude practice involves first calming breathing,
exhale emphasized breathing, instance, physiological size, things talked
podcast can help calm 'cause lot exhales,
now know, slows heart rate down, gratitude
practice, fine. actually not necessary, lot studies used that.
think narrative set, heard story meaning you,
recollection story genuinely thanked, think just
60 seconds maybe 120 seconds sufficient. question becomes,
often repeat gratitude practice. not exactly clear existing
literature. can't point one study says five times week four times week.
going throw number three times week, people will
ask, well, gratitude practice? tell tell everybody

Now like talk neurochemistry neural circuits associated
gratitude pro-social behaviors. Numerous times podcast, talked
so-called neuromodulators. might've forgotten never heard
neuromodulators before, neuromodulators chemicals released brain
body change activity neural circuits. make certain brain areas
likely active brain areas less likely active.
neuromodulators names like dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, epinephrin,
on. main neuromodulators associated gratitude pro-social behaviors
tends serotonin. Serotonin released small collection neurons
brainstem called raphe, R-A-P-H-E, raphe nucleus, places

numerous places brain. tend increase activity particular

certain experiences. areas active, certain thought
processes get invoked. thought processes probably resemble something like,
hmm, like experience this, hmm, feels really good.
literally feed onto muscles via neurons, making happy stay stationary,
experiencing something like, move closer something find
attractive literally. powerful circuits. two brain areas,
one like focus medial prefrontal cortex. Many
probably heard medial prefrontal cortex, area brain
involved planning deep thinking evaluation different types
experiences, past, present, future. seems actually pretty much every study
human anything seems involve medial prefrontal cortex, least one get
impression just looking scientific abstracts papers days. think
worth us taking step back asking, medial prefrontal cortex really do,
right? one piece neural real estate right behind
forehead, involved many different things? reason can
involved

00:25:10 Prefrontal Cortex Set Context

many different things, reason especially important gratitude
medial prefrontal cortex sets context, okay? sets context literally defines
meaning experience. Now not abstract phenomenon. going
give physiological example this, going translate gratitude.
really want everyone understand, medial prefrontal cortex sets
context everything life? Well, following way. number
circuits deeper brain simply create sensations allow you,
say, perceive certain sensations. use example cold exposure,
something sometimes talk podcast, reasons.
deliberately place ice bath, uncomfortable, even
adapted cold forth. discomfort non-negotiable. However,
want to, knowledge particular
health benefits, medial prefrontal cortex can control areas deeper brain,
like hypothalamus, positively impact neurochemicals released
system. still get lot adrenaline getting ice bath. fact


deliberately, knowledge making choice,
deciding put discomfort, shown
create different positive effect things like dopamine, things like anti-
inflammatory markers, immune system, et cetera, compared someone
pushes ice bath, someone insists
really, really don't want to. subtle distinction here. just
distinction motivation desire, lack motivation forced
something. number effects described.
episode Robert Sapolsky earlier last year, talked study
animals, also shown humans. take mouse instance,
runs running wheel, mice really like do, many positive effects
reducing blood pressure, improvements neurochemistry, et cetera, mouse.
However, mouse cage right next trapped running
wheel run every time mouse runs 'cause wheels linked,
well, second mouse forced exact running experiences
negative shifts overall health metrics. Blood pressure goes up, stress hormones
go up, et cetera, not actually making choice. Medial prefrontal cortex
knob, switch rather, can take one experience allow us frame
creates positive health effects. exact experience framed
something don't want do, forced can create negative health
effects. Now exactly neurons medial prefrontal cortex rather
complicated, frankly not completely understood. somehow able adjust
activity neural circuits purely reflexive. say, neuroscience, like
really dumb neural circuits, just like switches, place context onto it. So,
gratitude mindset activates prefrontal cortex, sets context
experience can derive tremendous health benefits. leads us
question; kind gratitude practice going accomplish this, right?
not simply case take knife, don't please, don't experiment,
cut hand say, oh, know, going enjoy this. 'cause
good won't hurt. course it'll hurt, just like ice bath cold, no matter
what. can't lie myself, right? knowledge cutting bad
me, hard override. so, medial prefrontal cortex
tremendous capacity set context. beautifully respect gratitude.
can't simply lie yourself. can't simply say, oh, well, every experience


learning experience, terrible thing happens, oh, good, just going say good,
body will react good you. myth. frankly, myth
fairly pervasive self-help self-actualization literature.
opportunity reframe set context experiences. requires
specific set practices. can't simply lie quote unquote, fake
make it. Neural circuitry powerful plastic. can modified
context-dependent, not stupid.

00:30:10 Ineffective Gratitude Practices; Autonomic Variables

lie whether not experience actually good
not, brain knows. effective gratitude practice look like? Well,
examine ineffective, poor gratitude practice looks like.
therein lies really important information, including fact I, think millions
people wrong. gratitude practices see online
people talk various talks forth involves something like writing
reciting, thinking five 10 three 20 things especially
grateful for. really trying feel those, really try think deeply
emotions, sensations, perceptions associated
particular people, places things list. studies actually point fact
style gratitude practice not particularly effective shifting neural
circuitry, neural chemistry, somatic circuitry, circuits body, 'cause
literally organs neural circuits connected, circuits brain
body toward enhanced activation prefrontal cortex, enhanced activation
pro-social neural networks talking earlier. Now may come
surprise many you, certainly came surprise me.
evidence shift so-called autonomic arousal gratitude
practices, ones calling ineffective, can made slightly
effective. mean shift autonomic arousal? Well, briefly
aspect nervous system, within brain body call
autonomic nervous system. little bit misnomer autonomic means
automatic. fact, can take control autonomic nervous system. one
branch, meaning one set connections circuits associated making us
alert, so-called sympathetic nervous system, say sympathetic arm


autonomic nervous system, really mouthful. really associated
enhanced alertness kind excitement fear, nothing
sympathy. just enhanced alertness. arm autonomic
nervous system so-called parasympathetic arm autonomic nervous system.
also mouthful. just say calming aspect autonomic
nervous system. associated decreased heart rate, decreased breathing rate,
et cetera. two aspects, autonomic nervous system,
shown people brought state heightened sympathetic tone,
meaning alertness, intensity emotions experience
gratitude practice enhanced, effectiveness gratitude practice can
enhanced. seen nowadays somewhat commonly people, instance,
cyclic hyperventilated breathing, call laboratory. Breathing
intense that, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale deeply 25 30 breaths.
people will sit meditative stance, focus notepad paper.
write things grateful for. really try feel
things, think things. makes perfect sense
enhancing autonomic arousal toward alertness create robust feelings
robust impact gratitude practices, state,
alert therefore able bring detail, richness perception
understanding things list happened be.
say numerous approaches this. Sort self-help type stuff self
actualization seminars. People will things like cold baths, chanting,
number different experiences mainly geared towards
increased autonomic arousal. even practices using pharmacology
create increased autonomic arousal drop gratitude. Across board,
increase potency gratitude practice listing things paper
one's mind saying loud. somewhat surprisingly, least me, form

00:25:10 Prefrontal Cortex Set Context

many different things, reason especially important gratitude
medial prefrontal cortex sets context, okay? sets context literally defines
meaning experience. Now not abstract phenomenon. going
give physiological example this, going translate gratitude.
really want everyone understand, medial prefrontal cortex sets
context everything life? Well, following way. number
circuits deeper brain simply create sensations allow you,
say, perceive certain sensations. use example cold exposure,
something sometimes talk podcast, reasons.
deliberately place ice bath, uncomfortable, even
adapted cold forth. discomfort non-negotiable. However,

really dumb neural circuits, just like switches, place context onto it. So,
gratitude mindset activates prefrontal cortex, sets context
experience can derive tremendous health benefits. leads us
question; kind gratitude practice going accomplish this, right?
not simply case take knife, don't please, don't experiment,

00:30:10 Ineffective Gratitude Practices; Autonomic Variables

lie whether not experience actually good
not, brain knows. effective gratitude practice look like? Well,
examine ineffective, poor gratitude practice looks like.
therein lies really important information, including fact I, think millions
people wrong. gratitude practices see online
people talk various talks forth involves something like writing
reciting, thinking five 10 three 20 things especially
grateful for. really trying feel those, really try think deeply
emotions, sensations, perceptions associated
particular people, places things list. studies actually point fact
style gratitude practice not particularly effective shifting neural
circuitry, neural chemistry, somatic circuitry, circuits body, 'cause
literally organs neural circuits connected, circuits brain
body toward enhanced activation prefrontal cortex, enhanced activation
pro-social neural networks talking earlier. Now may come
surprise many you, certainly came surprise me.
evidence shift so-called autonomic arousal gratitude
practices, ones calling ineffective, can made slightly
effective. mean shift autonomic arousal? Well, briefly
aspect nervous system, within brain body call
autonomic nervous system. little bit misnomer autonomic means
automatic. fact, can take control autonomic nervous system. one
branch, meaning one set connections circuits associated making us
alert, so-called sympathetic nervous system, say sympathetic arm


autonomic nervous system, really mouthful. really associated
enhanced alertness kind excitement fear, nothing
sympathy. just enhanced alertness. arm autonomic
nervous system so-called parasympathetic arm autonomic nervous system.
also mouthful. just say calming aspect autonomic
nervous system. associated decreased heart rate, decreased breathing rate,
et cetera. two aspects, autonomic nervous system,
shown people brought state heightened sympathetic tone,
meaning alertness, intensity emotions experience
gratitude practice enhanced, effectiveness gratitude practice can
enhanced. seen nowadays somewhat commonly people, instance,
cyclic hyperventilated breathing, call laboratory. Breathing
intense that, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale deeply 25 30 breaths.
people will sit meditative stance, focus notepad paper.
write things grateful for. really try feel
things, think things. makes perfect sense
enhancing autonomic arousal toward alertness create robust feelings
robust impact gratitude practices, state,
alert therefore able bring detail, richness perception
understanding things list happened be.
say numerous approaches this. Sort self-help type stuff self
actualization seminars. People will things like cold baths, chanting,
number different experiences mainly geared towards
increased autonomic arousal. even practices using pharmacology
create increased autonomic arousal drop gratitude. Across board,
increase potency gratitude practice listing things paper

story can one receiving genuine thanks. key elements
one receiving thanks, gratitude, given
genuinely, wholeheartedly. can story observing someone else receiving
thanks expressing thanks. genuine interaction well,
giver receiver. So, first three elements.
recommend established story want use

many different things, reason especially important gratitude
medial prefrontal cortex sets context, okay? sets context literally defines

really want everyone understand, medial prefrontal cortex sets
context everything life? Well, following way. number

examine ineffective, poor gratitude practice looks like.
therein lies really important information, including fact I, think millions
people wrong. gratitude practices see online
people talk various talks forth involves something like writing
reciting, thinking five 10 three 20 things especially

simply writing things thankful for, right? so,
this? Well, people digest story number different ways. People watch movies,

don't listen whole story time. story one
genuinely thanked something made feel good,
story someone else genuinely expressing thanks, okay? Based
description gratitude practices talked earlier. gratitude practice
can brief. mean, brief one minute, 60 seconds, five minutes,
still seems brief me. Although studies, getting
really major effects just five minutes gratitude practice. papers
involve people focusing breathing calming
go gratitude practice, within five minute block. decide
going gratitude practice involves first calming breathing,
exhale emphasized breathing, instance, physiological size, things talked
podcast can help calm 'cause lot exhales,
now know, slows heart rate down, gratitude

think narrative set, heard story meaning you,

60 seconds maybe 120 seconds sufficient. question becomes,
often repeat gratitude practice. not exactly clear existing

gratitude practice positive effects described. First all, gratitude
practice grounded narrative, meaning story. don't recite
hear story every single time gratitude practice, know
story gratitude practice references back to. Second all,
story can one receiving genuine thanks. key elements
one receiving thanks, gratitude, given
genuinely, wholeheartedly. can story observing someone else receiving
thanks expressing thanks. genuine interaction well,
giver receiver. So, first three elements.
recommend established story want use
gratitude practice, write three four simple bullet points can serve
salient reminders story you, will serve kind cue story without
listen to, talk entire story. recommend writing
something state person received
gratitude, state person received
gratitude, elements lend sort emotional weight tone

ideal gratitude practice, know certain features. First all,
grounded story, probably story heard entirety least once.
can shorthand version, so-called bullet points talked
allow drop story emotional associations story.
don't listen whole story time. story one
genuinely thanked something made feel good,
story someone else genuinely expressing thanks, okay? Based
description gratitude practices talked earlier. gratitude practice
can brief. mean, brief one minute, 60 seconds, five minutes,
still seems brief me. Although studies, getting
really major effects just five minutes gratitude practice. papers
involve people focusing breathing calming
go gratitude practice, within five minute block. decide
going gratitude practice involves first calming breathing,
exhale emphasized breathing, instance, physiological size, things talked
podcast can help calm 'cause lot exhales,
now know, slows heart rate down, gratitude
practice, fine. actually not necessary, lot studies used that.
think narrative set, heard story meaning you,
recollection story genuinely thanked, think just
60 seconds maybe 120 seconds sufficient. question becomes,
often repeat gratitude practice. not exactly clear existing
literature. can't point one study says five times week four times week.
going throw number three times week, people will
ask, well, gratitude practice? tell tell everybody
almost every practice exceptions, best time day
practice

01:05:44 Empathy & Anterior Cingulate Cortex

first wake morning, go sleep night, time
day. talked neurocircuitry changes associated


regular gratitude practice. mention additional neurocircuitry
shift occurs. relates structure mentioned just briefly earlier,
so-called ACC anterior cingulate cortex. area brain several
functions, data pointing fact ACC actually
involved empathy involved understanding emotional states others
general, even doesn't evoke sense empathy. several studies
point fact humans regular gratitude practice, ACC becomes
robustly engaged, even brief gratitude practices. actually
project lab. actually done animal models, animals observe
animals experiencing certain emotional states. one brain areas
identified important this; kind primordial form empathy 'cause really
don't know mice thinking. work humans, case
work humans, course ask tell us think thinking.
mice, ask them, don't tell us much anything interesting. Instead
measure number physiological signals. important point ACC,
anterior cingulate cortex seems important hub generation
execution empathy relates feelings empathic behaviors; altruistic
behaviors animals helping animals humans helping humans. see
animal models, see humans. So, want empathic
person, gratitude practice also going effective that, appears,
especially using narrative type approach using someone else's
narrative

01:07:35 Reducing Inflammation & Fear Gratitude

receiving gratitude way tap sense gratitude. Thus far,
mainly talked effects gratitude neural circuit activation, changes
little bit changes happening terms body, heart rate
breathing forth. haven't talked lot yet changes health
metrics, things like inflammation reductions inflammation immunity
things sort. mind, like describe results really
interesting recent study published journal Brain Behavior Immunity.
published 2021. title study is, Exploring Neural Mechanisms
Health Benefits Gratitude Women: Randomized Control Trial. first author


Hazlitt. basically, paper showed women regular
gratitude practice sort talking now, showed
reductions amygdala activity; brain area associated threat detection, intimate
part fear network brain. reductions amygdala activation, large
reductions production something called TNF-alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha,
IL-6, interleukin six. Now, happen listened episode
activating immune system immune function, heard TNF-alpha
IL-6. TNF-alpha IL six inflammatory cytokines. chemicals exist
body, released cells damage kind systemic
stress; system duress. short-term, can beneficial.
can call signals wound healing repair cells, et cetera, don't
want TNF-alpha IL-6 levels high, don't want levels
long. so, study really nice showed significant effects
reducing TNF-alpha IL-6 response gratitude practice. also
observed reductions amygdala activation, area associated threat detection
fear, likely, emphasize likely, 'cause don't know, direction
effect neural circuit changes, turn shift degree
inflammatory cytokines released body. Although know,
way too. gratitude practice shifts something
heart rate breathing, turn lowers amount TNF-alpha IL-6,
turn reduces activation amygdala. don't really know direction
effect, excuse me, speculate, speculate shift
neural circuitry led change circuits body. another interesting
aspect study reductions amygdala activation reductions
TNF-alpha IL-6 rapid. occurred almost immediately
gratitude practice completed. even though study performed
exclusively female subjects, based biology circuitry amygdala
biology TNF-alpha IL-6 performing inflammatory role men
women, don't see reason results study wouldn't pertain

01:10:56 Serotonin, Kanna/Zembrin

men women. chemistry associated gratitude?
certain chemicals brain enhance brain


enhance gratitude practice? Indeed, are. earlier mentioned chemical,
neuromodulator serotonin powerful influence activation neural
circuits associated pro-social behaviors gratitude, sort feel good
behaviors. make long story short, neuromodulators like dopamine epinephrine
norepinephrine tend place us state external perception, meaning state
observing things focusing things outside immediate reach body
confines skin. tend put us pursuit, thinking things
future away physical body. Whereas neuromodulators serotonin
associated pathways like oxytocin neurochemicals tend to, want
emphasize, tend associated states contentment
within confines body immediate experience. not
much pursuit, gratitude appreciation already
have. remiss didn't therefore point one shift chemistry
toward higher levels serotonin, would, logic, experience heightened
levels gratitude. indeed people this. will take compounds
increase serotonin. number compounds there, know.
certainly not suggesting people that. couple supplement based legal, over-
the-counter approaches things like 5-HTP, precursor serotonin.
people will take 5-HTP try enhance sleep. not fan that,
personally. talked sleep episodes. state call sleep
complex important architecture relates neurochemicals.
taking serotonin supplement stimulating serotonin release supplement
5-HTP tryptophan, amino acid precursor serotonin, one can run
problem disrupting normal architecture sleep cycles throughout
night. experienced as, taken 5-HTP tryptophan, fall asleep deeply,
wake three hours later can't fall asleep all. actually
sometimes even messes sleep subsequent night. people not
sensitive 5-HTP tryptophan actually really like it. again,
talk doctor, decide right you. responsible health, not
me. determine works you. Everyone's slightly individual.
one imagine enhancing amount serotonin brain body taking
5-HTP tryptophan gratitude practice, seems little bit extreme given
gratitude practice minute five minutes long regular basis,
may instances really trying amplify circuitry brain


body associated gratitude, therefore might something
want explore. new compound there. legal over-the-counter
compound. least legal United States, don't know overseas.
compound called Kanna, K-A-N-N-A. interesting compound. goes
another name well, is, going mispronounce apologize,
Sceletium tortuosum. Please see timestamps want see spelling
that. just call Kanna, name short. herb traditionally
chewed prior stressing endeavors, described examine.com.
looked studies this. kind interesting. likely increases
amount serotonin body pretty potently. generally taken dosages
anywhere 25 50 milligrams. creates kind pro-social gratitude
enhancing, say gratitude circuitry pro-social neurocircuitry enhancing effect
ways interacts certain urgent pathways brain.
also another name, sometimes called Zembrin, Z-E-M-B-R-I-N. Again, not

people using Zembrine, Sceletium tortuosum, also called Kanna, K-A-N-N-A, order
enhance states comfort pleasure one
immediate sphere experience. one imagine safe right
legal live enhancing serotonin taking Kanna
gratitude practice. logic behind that? Well, oftentimes hear
supplements pharmacology "increasing plasticity"

01:16:00 Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology, Brain Machine Interfaces

"opening plasticity." know, dollar every time someone said, hear
opens plasticity. Well, indeed molecules associated
thing call neuroplasticity. neuroplasticity not event, process;
meaning many, many steps. occurs wakefulness, consolidated
sleep forth. Taking substance increases neurochemical brain will
likely, provided right substance right practice, will likely enhance
amplitude intensity practice make potent form inducing
neuroplasticity. Meaning will create longer lasting robust brain changes
one hadn't increased chemistry way, way taking something.
doesn't necessarily mean couldn't get place without it,


simply slightly longer attitude practice putting little bit mental effort
it. said, think future neuroplasticity really resides not just one approach,
not just neurochemistry taking substances increase neuroplasticity, not just
behavioral practices try increase neuro-plasticity, not just brain machine
interfaces devices increase neuro-plasticity, rather convergence multiple
tools. imagine enhancing serotonergic transmission, say brain
using something like Kanna, combined gratitude practice. not-too-distant
future, will probably also combined sort noninvasive device
stimulate prefrontal cortex time. Please don't recreationally.

type circuitry events life. now know, lot science
gratitude can positively impact neural circuits brain. Anti-inflammatory markers
body, brain-heart breathing coordination, on. like just
highlight key elements effective, least knowledge, gratitude
practice. say effective, gleaning
scientific studies able find combining various findings studies
think practical, certainly effective


gratitude practice positive effects described. First all, gratitude
practice grounded narrative, meaning story. don't recite
hear story every single time gratitude practice, know
story gratitude practice references back to. Second all,
story can one receiving genuine thanks. key elements
one receiving thanks, gratitude, given
genuinely, wholeheartedly. can story observing someone else receiving
thanks expressing thanks. genuine interaction well,
giver receiver. So, first three elements.
recommend established story want use
gratitude practice, write three four simple bullet points can serve
salient reminders story you, will serve kind cue story without
listen to, talk entire story. recommend writing
something state person received
gratitude, state person received
gratitude, elements lend sort emotional weight tone
story. three pages text, like, just couple bullet
points. don't think really matters. important thing embedded
memory really associated genuine exchange thanks,
receival things. think key elements. simple:
entire practice involves reading off bullet points cue nervous system
sense gratitude. one minute, trivial amount time
really think it, maybe two minutes, really ambitious five
minutes just really feeling genuine experience received gratitude
observed someone else receiving gratitude. terms frequency, think
good rule thumb three times week. time day
doesn't really matter. can't see so-called circadian effects
this. know people like gratitude practice go sleep night.
don't see problem go sleep night. also don't see
problem lunch break mid-morning first thing
morning. can't see logic placing one time day not another.
think important thing least three times week.
mentioned before, very, brief. barriers entry
this. just take step back protocol compare typically


literature, is, make list things thankful for, recite
mind things thankful for, count blessings. think everybody
counting blessings time. always something thankful
for. terms scientifically grounded gratitude practice also scientifically
demonstrated shift physiology level immune system look
neurocircuitry, reducing anxiety, increasing motivation, wonderful things
many us chasing time goals, think gratitude practice reveals
immensely powerful tool us use. come no
surprise pro-social circuits gratitude not recent phenomenon.
Discussions gratitude date back hundreds, not thousands years.
done today take modern science right 2021, really distill
neuroimaging data, neurochemistry, various aspects brain-body
connectivity, look protocols, take various subject groups. done
women, done two individuals, done brain imaging,
various changes theme allow us point simple, effective
protocol certainly use around Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving just,
one day throughout entire year, course. personally using

00:52:28 Narratives Shift Brain-Body Circuits

just simply reminding particular narrative. Now another
clear positive effect using narrative story-based approach gratitude
practice. story physiology. Now, earlier episode,
mentioned really incredible study listening story coordinated heart
rates different individuals, literally changed way heart beating.
title study conscious processing narrative stimulate synchronizes heart
rate individuals. first author Perez, again, published Cell Reports, Cell
Press journal, excellent journal. really elegant study. looked
instantaneous heart rate. use electrocardiogram that, simply way
look heart beats fine precision. also looked breathing
subjects listened stories. may know breathing heart
rate actually linked one another really interesting way. simple way put
inhale, heart rate speeds little bit, exhale,
heart rate slows down. movement diaphragm
thoracic cavity. physicians medical types call respiratory sinus
arrhythmia. mechanism get into, don't want distract us
main theme here. just remember inhale, heart rate speeds
up, exhale, heart rate slows down. looked breathing,
looked heart rates different individuals. listening story produced
consistent gaps heart rates people listening, different
individuals study not located place listened
story, listening story different times, different days entirely similar
heartbeat patterns listening story. means gratitude practice
story can return again, even not entire
story, just using shorthand bullet point version story, will create
perceptible real shift heartbeat breathing. actually
demonstrated now effective gratitude practice one can
rapidly shift, not just activation circuits brain pro-social behaviors,
also activation particular circuits heart lungs
organs body, can get reproducible state gratitude
time. important component that, element story, again,
don't listen read think entire story, start finish order


extract benefits, story over.
consequence, going shift physiology presumably relaxed state,
typically one associated gratitude. Although activation
gratitude circuits also shown create sense awe sense joy.
studies looking kind parsing difference gratitude
joy. able find studies that. general, neural circuits
activated tend overlap quite lot create sense gratitude.
don't want split hairs necessarily there. key thing want use
story, even experience somebody else's, keep coming
back again. makes potent tool can get
tremendous amount benefit

00:56:15 Can’t Lie Liking Something; Reluctance Giving

even short 60 seconds practice. Earlier, talked can't lie
say, know, grateful thing actually hate.
moment, going tell scientific data proves statement
made true, can't just lie derive benefits gratitude
practice. data also going point fact that, giving gratitude, not
just receiving it, giving gratitude, genuine. really
interesting studies published scientific reports, nature research journal.
title Neural Responses Intention Benefit Appraisal Critical
Distinguishing Gratitude Joy. somewhat complicated study, just going
hit high points. basically use functional
magnetic resonance imaging. look brain circuitry activation
high precision. people receiving money context experiment.
knowledge whether not money receiving
given wholeheartedly reluctantly. number different
variables study, including much money given. cases
little, cases, modest, cases, lot more. also
varied extent giver money, called benefactor,
wholeheartedly seem somewhat reluctantly. looked whether
not sense gratitude scaled amount money received and/or
intention benefactor. Whether not person giving money


wholeheartedly reluctantly. remarkable amount money
given strong component whether not somebody felt received
gratitude, makes sense, know, amount money metric
whether not somebody feels thanked. stronger variable, bigger impact came
whether not person giving money giving wholehearted
intention not reluctant intention. course, interaction
best circumstance course, person received lot money
somebody wholeheartedly wanted give lot money. every
derivation this. important. tells us many things extend way
beyond gratitude practices, that, genuine thanks count. Okay?
probably presume that. receiving genuine thanks also strong variable
determining whether not experience real gratitude, whether not empty,
regardless size gift. constrains gratitude practices somewhat,
think interesting important way, can't make stuff up. can't tell
experience great got lot money therefore justified
it, even though think give reluctantly, boss hates me,
gave raise. stuff stings right reasons, circuits
brain body oriented towards pro-social interactions.
sense, looking species, circuits want, will,
receive things people giving wholeheartedly. tells us
giver, better giving wholeheartedly, undermining
sense gratitude

00:59:55 Gratitude Changes Brain: Reduces Anxiety, Increases Motivation

someone going receive us. gradually building ultimate
gratitude practice based variety scientific literature there. know
many people probably interested developing gratitude practice long
lasting, maybe even permanent positive effects neural circuitry.
mind, want turn attention really interesting study. entitled effects
gratitude meditation neural network functional connectivity brain heart coupling.
make long story short lot simpler title, repeated gratitude
practice changes way brain circuits work. also changes way

brain, heart rate will speed up. probably also familiar
fact heart rate speeds reason no reason, probably
thinking, well, making heart rate speed up? brain
heart reciprocally innervated, say. talking one another
directions. two way highway. study looked changes so-called functional

gratitude. make long story short, found repeated gratitude
practice change resting state functional connectivity emotion motivation-
related brain regions. haven't mentioned strong enough incentive
regular gratitude practice now, definitely one pay attention to.
found regular gratitude practice shift functional conductivity
emotion pathways ways made anxiety fear circuits less likely active,
circuits feelings wellbeing, also motivation much active. find
remarkable important number people struggle issues
motivation. lot people highly motivated also issues anxiety
fear. study really points fact twofer. good
gratitude practice repeat regularly, reduce fear, anxiety circuits,
increase efficacy positive emotion, feel good circuits, circuits
associated motivation pursuit actually enhanced well.
strong incentive gratitude practice one use regularly. talk
regularly just moment. don't want go many details
study, although will put reference like. includes lot fMRI data,
imaging data different brain areas, many, many tables examples matrices
gratitude, resentment, et cetera,

01:03:00 5 Minutes (Is Enough), 3X Weekly, Timing Day

indeed circuits brain resentment, whether like not,
do. people, just circuits robust others.
remarkable thing one can shift circuits direction think people
like; sense wellbeing motivation less resentment


fear literally. really cool study also interventions
five minutes long. incredible, five minutes long. so, start build
ideal gratitude practice, know certain features. First all,
grounded story, probably story heard entirety least once.
can shorthand version, so-called bullet points talked
allow drop story emotional associations story.
don't listen whole story time. story one
genuinely thanked something made feel good,
story someone else genuinely expressing thanks, okay? Based
description gratitude practices talked earlier. gratitude practice
can brief. mean, brief one minute, 60 seconds, five minutes,
still seems brief me. Although studies, getting
really major effects just five minutes gratitude practice. papers
involve people focusing breathing calming
go gratitude practice, within five minute block. decide
going gratitude practice involves first calming breathing,
exhale emphasized breathing, instance, physiological size, things talked
podcast can help calm 'cause lot exhales,
now know, slows heart rate down, gratitude
practice, fine. actually not necessary, lot studies used that.
think narrative set, heard story meaning you,

60 seconds maybe 120 seconds sufficient. question becomes,
often repeat gratitude practice. not exactly clear existing

extract benefits, story over.
consequence, going shift physiology presumably relaxed state,
typically one associated gratitude. Although activation
gratitude circuits also shown create sense awe sense joy.
studies looking kind parsing difference gratitude
joy. able find studies that. general, neural circuits
activated tend overlap quite lot create sense gratitude.
don't want split hairs necessarily there. key thing want use
story, even experience somebody else's, keep coming
back again. makes potent tool can get
tremendous amount benefit

00:56:15 Can’t Lie Liking Something; Reluctance Giving

even short 60 seconds practice. Earlier, talked can't lie
say, know, grateful thing actually hate.
moment, going tell scientific data proves statement
made true, can't just lie derive benefits gratitude
practice. data also going point fact that, giving gratitude, not
just receiving it, giving gratitude, genuine. really
interesting studies published scientific reports, nature research journal.
title Neural Responses Intention Benefit Appraisal Critical
Distinguishing Gratitude Joy. somewhat complicated study, just going
hit high points. basically use functional
magnetic resonance imaging. look brain circuitry activation
high precision. people receiving money context experiment.
knowledge whether not money receiving
given wholeheartedly reluctantly. number different
variables study, including much money given. cases
little, cases, modest, cases, lot more. also
varied extent giver money, called benefactor,
wholeheartedly seem somewhat reluctantly. looked whether
not sense gratitude scaled amount money received and/or
intention benefactor. Whether not person giving money


wholeheartedly reluctantly. remarkable amount money
given strong component whether not somebody felt received
gratitude, makes sense, know, amount money metric
whether not somebody feels thanked. stronger variable, bigger impact came
whether not person giving money giving wholehearted
intention not reluctant intention. course, interaction
best circumstance course, person received lot money
somebody wholeheartedly wanted give lot money. every
derivation this. important. tells us many things extend way
beyond gratitude practices, that, genuine thanks count. Okay?
probably presume that. receiving genuine thanks also strong variable
determining whether not experience real gratitude, whether not empty,
regardless size gift. constrains gratitude practices somewhat,
think interesting important way, can't make stuff up. can't tell
experience great got lot money therefore justified
it, even though think give reluctantly, boss hates me,
gave raise. stuff stings right reasons, circuits
brain body oriented towards pro-social interactions.
sense, looking species, circuits want, will,
receive things people giving wholeheartedly. tells us
giver, better giving wholeheartedly, undermining
sense gratitude

00:59:55 Gratitude Changes Brain: Reduces Anxiety, Increases Motivation

someone going receive us. gradually building ultimate
gratitude practice based variety scientific literature there. know
many people probably interested developing gratitude practice long
lasting, maybe even permanent positive effects neural circuitry.
mind, want turn attention really interesting study. entitled effects
gratitude meditation neural network functional connectivity brain heart coupling.
make long story short lot simpler title, repeated gratitude
practice changes way brain circuits work. also changes way
heart brain interact. familiar fact brain


controls heart stressed something perceived
brain, heart rate will speed up. probably also familiar
fact heart rate speeds reason no reason, probably
thinking, well, making heart rate speed up? brain
heart reciprocally innervated, say. talking one another
directions. two way highway. study looked changes so-called functional
connectivity within brain brain heart, response
gratitude practices. control used, think interesting,
resentment intervention. think resentment apt control quite different
gratitude. make long story short, found repeated gratitude
practice change resting state functional connectivity emotion motivation-
related brain regions. haven't mentioned strong enough incentive
regular gratitude practice now, definitely one pay attention to.
found regular gratitude practice shift functional conductivity
emotion pathways ways made anxiety fear circuits less likely active,
circuits feelings wellbeing, also motivation much active. find
remarkable important number people struggle issues
motivation. lot people highly motivated also issues anxiety
fear. study really points fact twofer. good
gratitude practice repeat regularly, reduce fear, anxiety circuits,
increase efficacy positive emotion, feel good circuits, circuits
associated motivation pursuit actually enhanced well.
strong incentive gratitude practice one use regularly. talk
regularly just moment. don't want go many details
study, although will put reference like. includes lot fMRI data,
imaging data different brain areas, many, many tables examples matrices
gratitude, resentment, et cetera,

01:03:00 5 Minutes (Is Enough), 3X Weekly, Timing Day

indeed circuits brain resentment, whether like not,
do. people, just circuits robust others.
remarkable thing one can shift circuits direction think people
like; sense wellbeing motivation less resentment


fear literally. really cool study also interventions
five minutes long. incredible, five minutes long. so, start build
ideal gratitude practice, know certain features. First all,
grounded story, probably story heard entirety least once.
can shorthand version, so-called bullet points talked
allow drop story emotional associations story.
don't listen whole story time. story one
genuinely thanked something made feel good,
story someone else genuinely expressing thanks, okay? Based
description gratitude practices talked earlier. gratitude practice
can brief. mean, brief one minute, 60 seconds, five minutes,
still seems brief me. Although studies, getting
really major effects just five minutes gratitude practice. papers
involve people focusing breathing calming
go gratitude practice, within five minute block. decide
going gratitude practice involves first calming breathing,
exhale emphasized breathing, instance, physiological size, things talked
podcast can help calm 'cause lot exhales,
now know, slows heart rate down, gratitude
practice, fine. actually not necessary, lot studies used that.
think narrative set, heard story meaning you,
recollection story genuinely thanked, think just
60 seconds maybe 120 seconds sufficient. question becomes,
often repeat gratitude practice. not exactly clear existing
literature. can't point one study says five times week four times week.
going throw number three times week, people will
ask, well, gratitude practice? tell tell everybody
almost every practice exceptions, best time day
practice

01:05:44 Empathy & Anterior Cingulate Cortex

first wake morning, go sleep night, time
day. talked neurocircuitry changes associated


regular gratitude practice. mention additional neurocircuitry
shift occurs. relates structure mentioned just briefly earlier,
so-called ACC anterior cingulate cortex. area brain several
functions, data pointing fact ACC actually
involved empathy involved understanding emotional states others
general, even doesn't evoke sense empathy. several studies
point fact humans regular gratitude practice, ACC becomes
robustly engaged, even brief gratitude practices. actually
project lab. actually done animal models, animals observe
animals experiencing certain emotional states. one brain areas
identified important this; kind primordial form empathy 'cause really
don't know mice thinking. work humans, case
work humans, course ask tell us think thinking.
mice, ask them, don't tell us much anything interesting. Instead
measure number physiological signals. important point ACC,
anterior cingulate cortex seems important hub generation
execution empathy relates feelings empathic behaviors; altruistic
behaviors animals helping animals humans helping humans. see
animal models, see humans. So, want empathic
person, gratitude practice also going effective that, appears,
especially using narrative type approach using someone else's
narrative

01:07:35 Reducing Inflammation & Fear Gratitude

receiving gratitude way tap sense gratitude. Thus far,
mainly talked effects gratitude neural circuit activation, changes
little bit changes happening terms body, heart rate
breathing forth. haven't talked lot yet changes health
metrics, things like inflammation reductions inflammation immunity
things sort. mind, like describe results really
interesting recent study published journal Brain Behavior Immunity.
published 2021. title study is, Exploring Neural Mechanisms
Health Benefits Gratitude Women: Randomized Control Trial. first author


Hazlitt. basically, paper showed women regular
gratitude practice sort talking now, showed
reductions amygdala activity; brain area associated threat detection, intimate

body, released cells damage kind systemic
stress; system duress. short-term, can beneficial.
can call signals wound healing repair cells, et cetera, don't
want TNF-alpha IL-6 levels high, don't want levels
long. so, study really nice showed significant effects
reducing TNF-alpha IL-6 response gratitude practice. also
observed reductions amygdala activation, area associated threat detection
fear, likely, emphasize likely, 'cause don't know, direction
effect neural circuit changes, turn shift degree
inflammatory cytokines released body. Although know,
way too. gratitude practice shifts something
heart rate breathing, turn lowers amount TNF-alpha IL-6,
turn reduces activation amygdala. don't really know direction
effect, excuse me, speculate, speculate shift
neural circuitry led change circuits body. another interesting
aspect study reductions amygdala activation reductions
TNF-alpha IL-6 rapid. occurred almost immediately
gratitude practice completed. even though study performed
exclusively female subjects, based biology circuitry amygdala

women, don't see reason results study wouldn't pertain

01:10:56 Serotonin, Kanna/Zembrin

men women. chemistry associated gratitude?
certain chemicals brain enhance brain


enhance gratitude practice? Indeed, are. earlier mentioned chemical,
neuromodulator serotonin powerful influence activation neural
circuits associated pro-social behaviors gratitude, sort feel good
behaviors. make long story short, neuromodulators like dopamine epinephrine
norepinephrine tend place us state external perception, meaning state
observing things focusing things outside immediate reach body
confines skin. tend put us pursuit, thinking things
future away physical body. Whereas neuromodulators serotonin
associated pathways like oxytocin neurochemicals tend to, want
emphasize, tend associated states contentment
within confines body immediate experience. not
much pursuit, gratitude appreciation already
have. remiss didn't therefore point one shift chemistry
toward higher levels serotonin, would, logic, experience heightened
levels gratitude. indeed people this. will take compounds
increase serotonin. number compounds there, know.
certainly not suggesting people that. couple supplement based legal, over-
the-counter approaches things like 5-HTP, precursor serotonin.
people will take 5-HTP try enhance sleep. not fan that,
personally. talked sleep episodes. state call sleep
complex important architecture relates neurochemicals.
taking serotonin supplement stimulating serotonin release supplement
5-HTP tryptophan, amino acid precursor serotonin, one can run
problem disrupting normal architecture sleep cycles throughout
night. experienced as, taken 5-HTP tryptophan, fall asleep deeply,
wake three hours later can't fall asleep all. actually
sometimes even messes sleep subsequent night. people not
sensitive 5-HTP tryptophan actually really like it. again,
talk doctor, decide right you. responsible health, not
me. determine works you. Everyone's slightly individual.
one imagine enhancing amount serotonin brain body taking
5-HTP tryptophan gratitude practice, seems little bit extreme given
gratitude practice minute five minutes long regular basis,
may instances really trying amplify circuitry brain


body associated gratitude, therefore might something
want explore. new compound there. legal over-the-counter
compound. least legal United States, don't know overseas.
compound called Kanna, K-A-N-N-A. interesting compound. goes

controls heart stressed something perceived
brain, heart rate will speed up. probably also familiar
fact heart rate speeds reason no reason, probably
thinking, well, making heart rate speed up? brain
heart reciprocally innervated, say. talking one another
directions. two way highway. study looked changes so-called functional
connectivity within brain brain heart, response
gratitude practices. control used, think interesting,
resentment intervention. think resentment apt control quite different
gratitude. make long story short, found repeated gratitude
practice change resting state functional connectivity emotion motivation-
related brain regions. haven't mentioned strong enough incentive
regular gratitude practice now, definitely one pay attention to.
found regular gratitude practice shift functional conductivity
emotion pathways ways made anxiety fear circuits less likely active,
circuits feelings wellbeing, also motivation much active. find
remarkable important number people struggle issues
motivation. lot people highly motivated also issues anxiety
fear. study really points fact twofer. good
gratitude practice repeat regularly, reduce fear, anxiety circuits,
increase efficacy positive emotion, feel good circuits, circuits
associated motivation pursuit actually enhanced well.
strong incentive gratitude practice one use regularly. talk
regularly just moment. don't want go many details
study, although will put reference like. includes lot fMRI data,
imaging data different brain areas, many, many tables examples matrices
gratitude, resentment, et cetera,

01:03:00 5 Minutes (Is Enough), 3X Weekly, Timing Day

indeed circuits brain resentment, whether like not,
do. people, just circuits robust others.
remarkable thing one can shift circuits direction think people
like; sense wellbeing motivation less resentment


fear literally. really cool study also interventions
five minutes long. incredible, five minutes long. so, start build
ideal gratitude practice, know certain features. First all,
grounded story, probably story heard entirety least once.
can shorthand version, so-called bullet points talked
allow drop story emotional associations story.
don't listen whole story time. story one
genuinely thanked something made feel good,
story someone else genuinely expressing thanks, okay? Based
description gratitude practices talked earlier. gratitude practice
can brief. mean, brief one minute, 60 seconds, five minutes,
still seems brief me. Although studies, getting
really major effects just five minutes gratitude practice. papers
involve people focusing breathing calming
go gratitude practice, within five minute block. decide
going gratitude practice involves first calming breathing,
exhale emphasized breathing, instance, physiological size, things talked
podcast can help calm 'cause lot exhales,
now know, slows heart rate down, gratitude
practice, fine. actually not necessary, lot studies used that.
think narrative set, heard story meaning you,
recollection story genuinely thanked, think just
60 seconds maybe 120 seconds sufficient. question becomes,
often repeat gratitude practice. not exactly clear existing
literature. can't point one study says five times week four times week.
going throw number three times week, people will
ask, well, gratitude practice? tell tell everybody
almost every practice exceptions, best time day
practice

01:05:44 Empathy & Anterior Cingulate Cortex

first wake morning, go sleep night, time
day. talked neurocircuitry changes associated


regular gratitude practice. mention additional neurocircuitry
shift occurs. relates structure mentioned just briefly earlier,
so-called ACC anterior cingulate cortex. area brain several
functions, data pointing fact ACC actually
involved empathy involved understanding emotional states others
general, even doesn't evoke sense empathy. several studies
point fact humans regular gratitude practice, ACC becomes
robustly engaged, even brief gratitude practices. actually
project lab. actually done animal models, animals observe
animals experiencing certain emotional states. one brain areas
identified important this; kind primordial form empathy 'cause really
don't know mice thinking. work humans, case
work humans, course ask tell us think thinking.
mice, ask them, don't tell us much anything interesting. Instead
measure number physiological signals. important point ACC,
anterior cingulate cortex seems important hub generation
execution empathy relates feelings empathic behaviors; altruistic
behaviors animals helping animals humans helping humans. see
animal models, see humans. So, want empathic
person, gratitude practice also going effective that, appears,
especially using narrative type approach using someone else's
narrative

01:07:35 Reducing Inflammation & Fear Gratitude

receiving gratitude way tap sense gratitude. Thus far,
mainly talked effects gratitude neural circuit activation, changes
little bit changes happening terms body, heart rate
breathing forth. haven't talked lot yet changes health
metrics, things like inflammation reductions inflammation immunity
things sort. mind, like describe results really
interesting recent study published journal Brain Behavior Immunity.
published 2021. title study is, Exploring Neural Mechanisms
Health Benefits Gratitude Women: Randomized Control Trial. first author


Hazlitt. basically, paper showed women regular
gratitude practice sort talking now, showed
reductions amygdala activity; brain area associated threat detection, intimate
part fear network brain. reductions amygdala activation, large
reductions production something called TNF-alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha,
IL-6, interleukin six. Now, happen listened episode
activating immune system immune function, heard TNF-alpha
IL-6. TNF-alpha IL six inflammatory cytokines. chemicals exist
body, released cells damage kind systemic
stress; system duress. short-term, can beneficial.
can call signals wound healing repair cells, et cetera, don't
want TNF-alpha IL-6 levels high, don't want levels
long. so, study really nice showed significant effects
reducing TNF-alpha IL-6 response gratitude practice. also
observed reductions amygdala activation, area associated threat detection
fear, likely, emphasize likely, 'cause don't know, direction
effect neural circuit changes, turn shift degree
inflammatory cytokines released body. Although know,
way too. gratitude practice shifts something
heart rate breathing, turn lowers amount TNF-alpha IL-6,
turn reduces activation amygdala. don't really know direction
effect, excuse me, speculate, speculate shift
neural circuitry led change circuits body. another interesting
aspect study reductions amygdala activation reductions
TNF-alpha IL-6 rapid. occurred almost immediately
gratitude practice completed. even though study performed
exclusively female subjects, based biology circuitry amygdala
biology TNF-alpha IL-6 performing inflammatory role men
women, don't see reason results study wouldn't pertain

01:10:56 Serotonin, Kanna/Zembrin

men women. chemistry associated gratitude?
certain chemicals brain enhance brain


enhance gratitude practice? Indeed, are. earlier mentioned chemical,
neuromodulator serotonin powerful influence activation neural
circuits associated pro-social behaviors gratitude, sort feel good
behaviors. make long story short, neuromodulators like dopamine epinephrine
norepinephrine tend place us state external perception, meaning state
observing things focusing things outside immediate reach body
confines skin. tend put us pursuit, thinking things
future away physical body. Whereas neuromodulators serotonin
associated pathways like oxytocin neurochemicals tend to, want
emphasize, tend associated states contentment
within confines body immediate experience. not
much pursuit, gratitude appreciation already
have. remiss didn't therefore point one shift chemistry
toward higher levels serotonin, would, logic, experience heightened
levels gratitude. indeed people this. will take compounds
increase serotonin. number compounds there, know.
certainly not suggesting people that. couple supplement based legal, over-
the-counter approaches things like 5-HTP, precursor serotonin.
people will take 5-HTP try enhance sleep. not fan that,
personally. talked sleep episodes. state call sleep
complex important architecture relates neurochemicals.
taking serotonin supplement stimulating serotonin release supplement
5-HTP tryptophan, amino acid precursor serotonin, one can run
problem disrupting normal architecture sleep cycles throughout
night. experienced as, taken 5-HTP tryptophan, fall asleep deeply,
wake three hours later can't fall asleep all. actually
sometimes even messes sleep subsequent night. people not
sensitive 5-HTP tryptophan actually really like it. again,
talk doctor, decide right you. responsible health, not
me. determine works you. Everyone's slightly individual.
one imagine enhancing amount serotonin brain body taking
5-HTP tryptophan gratitude practice, seems little bit extreme given
gratitude practice minute five minutes long regular basis,
may instances really trying amplify circuitry brain


body associated gratitude, therefore might something
want explore. new compound there. legal over-the-counter
compound. least legal United States, don't know overseas.
compound called Kanna, K-A-N-N-A. interesting compound. goes
another name well, is, going mispronounce apologize,
Sceletium tortuosum. Please see timestamps want see spelling
that. just call Kanna, name short. herb traditionally
chewed prior stressing endeavors, described examine.com.
looked studies this. kind interesting. likely increases
amount serotonin body pretty potently. generally taken dosages
anywhere 25 50 milligrams. creates kind pro-social gratitude
enhancing, say gratitude circuitry pro-social neurocircuitry enhancing effect
ways interacts certain urgent pathways brain.
also another name, sometimes called Zembrin, Z-E-M-B-R-I-N. Again, not
suggesting people run take stuff. emerging practice
people using Zembrine, Sceletium tortuosum, also called Kanna, K-A-N-N-A, order
enhance states comfort pleasure one
immediate sphere experience. one imagine safe right
legal live enhancing serotonin taking Kanna
gratitude practice. logic behind that? Well, oftentimes hear
supplements pharmacology "increasing plasticity"

01:16:00 Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology, Brain Machine Interfaces

"opening plasticity." know, dollar every time someone said, hear
opens plasticity. Well, indeed molecules associated
thing call neuroplasticity. neuroplasticity not event, process;
meaning many, many steps. occurs wakefulness, consolidated
sleep forth. Taking substance increases neurochemical brain will
likely, provided right substance right practice, will likely enhance
amplitude intensity practice make potent form inducing
neuroplasticity. Meaning will create longer lasting robust brain changes
one hadn't increased chemistry way, way taking something.
doesn't necessarily mean couldn't get place without it,


simply slightly longer attitude practice putting little bit mental effort
it. said, think future neuroplasticity really resides not just one approach,
not just neurochemistry taking substances increase neuroplasticity, not just
behavioral practices try increase neuro-plasticity, not just brain machine
interfaces devices increase neuro-plasticity, rather convergence multiple
tools. imagine enhancing serotonergic transmission, say brain
using something like Kanna, combined gratitude practice. not-too-distant
future, will probably also combined sort noninvasive device
stimulate prefrontal cortex time. Please don't recreationally.
devices clinical use currently. think start get idea.
little bit exploratory want go
reading this, thought might find Kanna interesting. certainly did.
number studies will pop PubMed. recommend using examine.com
jumping off point. decent studies described so-called
human effect matrix. studies done humans. main effects
documented scientific literature minor, significant increases
cognition, executive function. Executive function something also associated
prefrontal cortex, reductions anxiety. seems common theme
seeing again. saw study, trial saw

story gratitude practice references back to. Second all,
story can one receiving genuine thanks. key elements
one receiving thanks, gratitude, given
genuinely, wholeheartedly. can story observing someone else receiving
thanks expressing thanks. genuine interaction well,
giver receiver. So, first three elements.
recommend established story want use
gratitude practice, write three four simple bullet points can serve

listen to, talk entire story. recommend writing
something state person received
gratitude, state person received
gratitude, elements lend sort emotional weight tone
story. three pages text, like, just couple bullet
points. don't think really matters. important thing embedded

receival things. think key elements. simple:
entire practice involves reading off bullet points cue nervous system
sense gratitude. one minute, trivial amount time
really think it, maybe two minutes, really ambitious five
minutes just really feeling genuine experience received gratitude
observed someone else receiving gratitude. terms frequency, think
good rule thumb three times week. time day
doesn't really matter. can't see so-called circadian effects
this. know people like gratitude practice go sleep night.
don't see problem go sleep night. also don't see
problem lunch break mid-morning first thing

gratitude practice positive effects described. First all, gratitude
practice grounded narrative, meaning story. don't recite
hear story every single time gratitude practice, know
story gratitude practice references back to. Second all,
story can one receiving genuine thanks. key elements
one receiving thanks, gratitude, given
