00:06:58 Sleep Phases, Perfect Night’s Sleep

Expanding again, that’s livemomentous.com Huberman now discussion Dr
Gina Poe, Dr Gino Poe, welcome. Thank you. really looking forward
conversation familiar work - know many people going
excited learn work relates sleep relates problem solving
creativity, addiction craving relapse. number important topics start
things off, love educate us bit thing familiar with,
yet us understand, sleep describe
Various phases sleep exist, distinguish perhaps frame within
context perfect night's sleep? Look like okay? long last
less, biology look like what? perfect night's sleep? Oh yeah,
that’s great question right, sleep really different wakefulness and, fact, can't
replaced state wakefulness able come far.
brain chemistry completely different different stages sleep
non-rem REM two major states sleep every animal studied far
seems States anyway. two states entirely different one
another too, even within non-rem. three states stage, one
slip first falling asleep. It’s dozing, kind interesting Rhythm
goes brain. It’s kind fast gamma Rhythm stage two,
really cool State. sort used ignore sleep researchers transient
State wakefulness Deep stage, three slow way, sleep,
impressively different then, REM, sleep. stage two talk


little bit Deep slow way sleep state, big, slow waves
sweep brain, now realize cleans brain. One things
big slow waves cleans. brain really important things
restore us um day wakefulness REM, sleep popular
that’s active dreams um. wake someone
REM, sleep almost always report dreams. Something really bizarre.
That’s called REM, sleep, rapid eye movement, sleep, four states sleep
human sleep cycle every 90 minutes go sleep,
say: 10. 10, 30. 11 o'clock, first REM, sleep period, comes hundred five
minutes fall asleep lasts 20 minutes. Actually, comes 95 minutes
last 10 15 minutes, start five per
night perfect night's sleep, four five. Something like that. Perfect night's sleep
seven half eight hours. really great study put people semi-
darkened room nothing, bed 12 hours every day month,
people initially because, sleep, deprived nation, slept
lot usual. Like 10 11 hours 12, leveled off week
two eight hours 15 minutes sleep, actually can't oversleep. mean
nothing else butt sleep round off average, eight hours
15 minutes night spend rest

00:10:32 Can Oversleep?

Time twiddling thumbs, humming Tunes, interesting daydreaming. want get back
Contour perfect night's sleep, intrigued idea people can't
oversleep often asked whether not can get much sleep whether not
sleeping long long excuse can make us groggy. next day anything
um one determine long sleep right average average
yeah? Well, that’s interesting different people need seem need different amounts
sleep, don't really even know exactly sleep for. need
know kind it’s it’s. know Mercury murky um, know lot things sleep
now us, don't know long things take. long need
sleep also just big question mark, people don't feel rested slept
nine hours people don't feel rested three four half, people
consistently deprive sleep sleeping four four
half hours night build cognitive deficit just builds time. nights


sleep deprivation, cognitive deficit have, need sleep
sleep recover. Now question um: can over? Can
oversleep right? Can sleep point it’s much? know growing
um high school. girlfriend's dad belief no one sleep
past 6 a.m, wake two children home. wake
kids house. sing sleeping regardless people
went, went sleep, always thought um, interesting mentality, yeah um,
that’s not terrible. Actually, will it'll put make sleepier
next night get bed time, it'll build homeostatic need wake
early um, don't think can oversleep, people sleep Lot like people
sleep nine hours, it’s probably indicative problem, because, fact,
lot different conditions, will cause sleep lot more, probably
interferes efficient sleep. efficiency sleep, find
sleep consistently nine hours plus every night, might want consult
doctor maybe else might be. cancer, sleep apnea
just affects lot people. sleep super inefficient
snoring lot know waking lot know every night.
might want sleep study just see sleep see else might
be, causing sleep much, wouldn't be. somebody sleeping nine ten
hours. know every while. mean, they're, consistently sleeping
nine hours, feel like need order function cognitively next day.
might sleep just not efficient might want look that’s
case interesting. Forgive anecdote, can't resist years ago went
acupuncturist um. gave red pills, don't know contain
uh-oh, took told help sleep fall
asleep 30 minutes taking them, incred incredibly excuse
vivid Dreams wake four five hours gone sleep feeling completely
rested something never really experienced interesting consistent basis. want
mass spec pills. still no idea whatsoever exactly
people thought perhaps GHB gamma hydroxybutyrate,
way, illegal drug. can kill you, it’s not a, not something want take um
anyway, if, ever someone can figure red pills um,
not red pill sort red pill. just red sleep pills. Interesting, mean
even placebo effect, Placebo extremely strong. So, although
don't know, really something red pills



00:14:50 Sleep Cycles, Sleep Spindles, “Falling” Asleep, Dreams & Memories

shout acupuncturists uh Eastern medicine um, return
idea architecture perfect night's sleep. said um, fall asleep.
first 90 minutes sleep REM, sleep, rapid eye movement. Sleep will arrive 95
minutes in. mean rest 90 minutes consumed slow wave
sleep, yeah, non-rem, sleep, okay, Sleep lightly asleep?
might dream us somehow thinking movement jolt
away, often happens early night. Yeah yeah. That’s first
stage stage, one stage two sleep stage: two sleep really cool,
something called sleep, spindles K complexes sleep spindles little bit
activity. That’s 10 15 Hertz frequency. It’s conversation thalamus
cortex, thalamus gateway Consciousness neocortex. know,
processes cognition um. it’s it’s. spindles called sleep spindles
wake state, will often report dream like hallucination style
dream. won't long dream report like you, REM sleep, will
hallucination state enduring. falling asleep one reasons call falling
asleep stage one stage two muscles relaxing part
brain, that’s conscious enough sort recognize relaxation will feel like
falling will jerk Awake often hallucination, it’s called hypnagotic hallucination will
feel like it'll include falling aspect will wake that’s really interesting me.
long felt sensation almost like dropping back head um, much
elevate feet just slightly tilt head back just slightly order go sleep, find
fall asleep much faster interesting, feel going fall, like almost gon
na, backward somersault. actually really like sensation usually
proceeds falling deeply yeah. That’s really interesting. somebody study
elevated feet yeah. little bit um body position sleep
washout talk early night um. got lighter stages sleep,
less rapid eye movement, sleep. can say dreams occur
say? First second um, know 90 minute cycles sleep. quite different
patterns sleep dreaming occur later night toward morning? Well,
okay, that’s interesting question. lot facets it. evidence
first four hours sleep important memory processing fact,
learned something new day experienced new sensory motor experience,
early sleep dreams will incorporate experience. Much later sleep
dreams later, memory gets Consolidated early structures,


hippocampus deep temporal lobe cortex distributed fashion. memory
seems move hippocampus cortex also dreams incorporate
memory also move later night. nobody knows why, does.
great study siddarta Ribeiro studied consolidation memories cortex
hippocampus cortex rat across period full day. Sleep
rats sleep daytime found subsequent Rim sleep period, moved
memory, hippocampus first first area, projects second
area. third area. can see memory moving

00:19:01 Tool: Growth Hormone Release & Sleep

Um throughout Sleep cool period, yeah cool, read
study. um number different hormones associated different stages
sleep. know melatonin hormone nighttime nighttime. makes sleepy
um growth hormone release occur sleep, growth
hormone release happens day, long night long, Deep, slow way sleep
get. first sleep cycle get big bolus growth, hormone release
men women equally, miss first deep, slow way sleep period,
also miss big bolus growth hormone release might get ultimately across
day, just much overall growth hormone release, endocrinologists will tell big
boluses different things little bit eeked time. well. know,
also big push synthesize proteins. that’s protein synthesis part
builds memories, example brain, happens first cycle sleep. don't
want miss that, especially learned something really big needs needs
synaptic space encode it. somebody miss first 90 minutes driving
yeah? say normally go sleep 10 pm 10 11 30
first phase sleep that’s growth hormone, big bolus growth
hormone released. mean go sleep instead 11, 30
midnight miss first phase sleep, not case get first phase
sleep just simply starting later? beautiful clock body. knows
things happen, it’s every cell body clock clocks
normally synchronized Circadian clocks synchronized, cells
ready respond onto growth hormone release particular time, Miss
it’s time relation melatonin also miss yeah might get growth
hormone release, it’s occurring time clock already moved


next phase, it’s it’s just clock thing. Yeah, don't think can overstate
importance just described honest, despite knowing bit
Sleep, research circadian biology. first time ever heard
normally go sleep particular time growth hormone released first
phase sleep can't simply initiate sleep bout later expect capture
first phase sleep yeah, that’s incredible think important um, many listeners
probably realizing, also highly actionable. means
fairly consistent bedtimes addition fairly consistent, wait times. right exactly
fact one

00:22:05 Adolescence; Early Sleep, Alcohol & Sleep Spindles

Best markers good neurological health get older, consistent, bedtimes, wow,
okay, um. don't want backtrack, write something think important
resolve resolve. going ask um people sleep, nine
hours perhaps reflecting issue. underlying issue, perhaps
teenager adolescent undergoing stage development lot
bodily brain growth. exception that, because, yes, don't recall sleeping ton
teenager, ton energy, know teenagers sleep lot yeah
like they'll, just sleep sleep sleep sleep: let Sleep sleep
sleep okay, can sleep okay, that’s one exception. just like babies?
Okay, developing something brain rest body. really
need sleep help. Organize mean sleep really hard work organizing
brains making develop right, deprive sleep will actually
also just like, like. said daily clock. also developmental clock
can miss developmental window don't let sleep extra like need
things inhibit: growth, hormone release components first stage sleep.
words, go sleep religiously, every night 10 pm things perhaps
preceding hours preceding day like ingest, caffeine alcohol, can make
first stage sleep less effective. Even going sleep time, alcohol
definitely will alcohol REM, sleep suppressant even suppresses
stage. Two transition REM sleep spindles sleep
spindles. didn't talk function yet, really important moving
memories cortex. It’s unique time hippocampus, sort like ram
brains, writes hard disk cortex it’s unique time


connected. don't want miss don't want miss REM sleep
also part consolidation process schema changing process alcohol
there. know go sleep, metabolized alcohol
put bodies, will affect sleep badly, probably fair say no ingestion
alcohol within four six hours preceding sleep, given half-life all,
better, know people refuse go way maybe little bit okay.
don't know dose response is, um studies there. can look
great yeah, still first stage sleep apologize slowing us down.
sounds like it’s

00:24:55 Middle Sleep States & REM, Schema, Waking Night

Incredibly important first phase sleep. second third 90 minute blocks
sleep? anything makes um unique? signature uh besides
fact come second third night, REM sleep?
later night get um also change hormones. know growth
hormone melatonin levels starting decline, hormones picking up.
really different stage also don't want shortchange think
that’s stage. Many studies showing times sleep
creativity can happen. That’s dreams can incorporate put together old new
things together new way um schema built time. um
yeah. can change minds best phases sleep. elaborate
little bit schema? No one, don't think anyone podcast ever discussed.
Schema little bit familiar schema courses psychology, it’s
while. maybe just refresh mind everyone. Well, it’s it’s still concept
right, think schema um like schema Christmas right.
kinds ideas sew together call Christmas holiday season northern
hemisphere. It’s cold. Santa Claus reindeer jingle bells, even things
false, normally associate Christmas presents family gathering
stuff sewn together one thread linking all, can just
give list words um none contain word Christmas
ask people later um, know, give another list words include word
Christmas say: oh yeah. word minds brought
word Christmas, it’s part whole schema. that’s it’s sort
related, lot related Concepts. guess think it, sort like desktop


computer um scare people, it’s just ton folders yeah,
folder names means something clear specific me. Right inside
folders collections things make sense terms batched kind
one way, exactly? No that’s great way think REM sleep
later parts night transition REM, that’s computer
brain opening folders comparing documents. Seeing, anything same?
two documents look much same, little bit difference
can. can link conceptually that’s probably one origins creativity
finding things related, maybe just linked little bit, can find link
strengthen it. it, know, makes schema interesting different, interesting.
Um. Many people, including myself, tend wake up, maybe middle
night use restroom, tried drink less fluid going sleep I've. heard
also um impulse urinate - forgive topic, lot people deal this,
impulse urinate also dictated quickly drink fluid, not just total volume.
switched sipping fluids slowly. last beverage day, seems
help, point think lot people wake middle
night oftentimes use restroom oftentimes just around 3 A.M might
minutes, hopefully not phone viewing Bright Light, can cause
wakefulness go back sleep. known detriment middle
night waking consider normal feature people's sleep architecture?
think shouldn't worry it. Actually, think know sleep really incredibly well
homeostatically regulated really don't worry much sleeping long
you're, not intentionally depriving sleep something really rewarding
exciting, even stressful body deprives lot things
talking about, don't worry it, um, it’s absolutely normal wake up, least
middle night go bathroom long can get back
sleep reasonable amount Time, um, know, even takes hour, don't
worry long lifestyle allows make sleep
either next morning next night going bed little earlier. understand
correctly, little bit asymmetry sleep catching first phase sleep, it’s
like either get don't, get going sleep essentially
time night, maybe plus minus 15 minutes yeah, then, wake
middle night go back sleep, cannot catch up, can gather sleep
gotten had. just slept whole way night. right, yeah,
yeah, okay, yeah and, don't know actually answer whether not sleep
middle early sleep late sleep fact different another reason,


whether depriving sleep say one 2 30 morning bad
different way. don't know well, suppose experiment case,
tend wake per night sort come recognize part normal
sleep architecture, don't obsess it. notice go back sleep
especially toward mourning sleep

00:30:33 Deep Sleep, Dreams & Senses

incredibly deep, dreams incredibly Vivid. don't always remember them,
unique, perhaps architecture dreams sleep say last third
night second half night right yeah. second half night,
longer REM, sleep periods considered deepest sleep. Even though
slow wave sleep, big, slow wave considered deep. deep yeah, call slow, wave
sleep, deep sleep REM sleep rapid mean, now telling REM sleep
actually deeper sleep. Okay, needs new nomenclature, sleep, researchers!
No, no, please. reason cause slow wave sleep deep sleep it’s
difficult arouse people state arouse state,
often confused just want go back sleep can go back pretty
Easily, arouse someone REM, sleep likely report something
really kind almost like wakefulness. vivid, fact, give someone
none threatening kind stimulation, like somebody dropping keys ping,
something like that, instead waking volume will wake someone non-
rim sleep, REM, sleeping instead lengthen amount time make even
dense rapid eye movements dense often people will incorporate
sound dreams. body brain somehow conscious um
sound, heard also smells can even make dreams REM sleep,
doesn't arouse us. doesn't arouse us often yeah interesting, maybe one
reasons REM sleep deeper especially adults older people deep slow
wave sleep goes away. it’s not deep. It’s not big slow waves aren't large,
probably problematic, not sure, REM sleep. becomes
deepest stage actually children, it’s kind toss-up it’s really hard wake
up. deep, slow wave sleep fact fire alarms, don't wake even
really loud fire alarms state sleep. that’s trying change fire
alarms that, instead something kids don't associate anything like whatever
don't associate says name something else may less loud


Salient will wake up. don't know carried sleeping children
car. don't know want children start waking sleep, that’s
one best things get home kids asleep back seat. can
literally throw shoulder gently course, yes put sleep in,
completely

elaborate dreams. paralyzed REM, sleep, correct! Yes, normally it’s
paralyzed that’s really good, that’s time actively dreaming
storyline dreams hurt - actually really cut off outside
world. terms know, responding say table window door,
different sleepwalking, slow wave sleep slowly sleep.
sleepwalking mixture sleep wakefulness, actually will respond


door. can cook full meal, drive car, deep slowly sleep, it’s scary,
never know going do. don't voluntary voluntary control
it. no conscious control it, can actually safely navigate
situations sleepwalking actually conversation, although may not make much
sense sleep talking REM, sleep you're, not processing outside world
instead, acting Dreams, things like walking
plate, glass window falling off know stairs things like that. really
want muscles inactivated REM, sleep. Otherwise, will act
dreams really hurt bed partner. sleep talking talking
sleep um? don't know many relationships um saved sleep talking,
guessing destroyed guessing um talking sleep
meaning perhaps no meaning just dreams meaning no
meaning, recall yeah not take sleep talking seriously, no matter people
say, doesn't necessarily reflect truth, it’s not like truthful
sleep talking, just saved number relationships. Um, not directing anyone
particular, guarantee just

00:36:47 Alarm Clock & Grogginess; Sleep Trackers, Brain & Sleep

um noted um people start approach mourning time normally
wake up, heard it’s important to, possible, complete one 90-minute
Cycles prior waking up. is, set alarm halfway one 90
minute cycles come late night sleep, can lead um rather groggy
patterns waking um. just ask directly: use alarm clock? not um,
thankfully line work doesn't require normally anything
particular time. unless catch plane, always set
alarm just case well. fellow academic, can tell you. plenty punishing
features academic scientist um offset fact don't
use alarm clock, nice can often set schedule.
recommend that, possible, people not use alarm clock yeah? Absolutely can
just listen body wake need wake up? great um
um. One reasons grogginess called Sleep inertia
wake wrong state, um deep, slow wave. Sleep liken
uh like washing machine cycle. 90-minute Cycles, like washing machine cycle
um first part, add water right clothes soaking wet. don't


want open washing machine try function put wear around,
soaking, wet full soap. wait cycle
can well. Actually, put dryer too, want wear
yeah can function. just takes little clothes brain dry out,
can actually function well, um, it’s better wait whole cycle. complete
that’s want set 90 90 minute alarm clock that’s around 90
minutes, first stage sleep, first cycle sleep, actually little longer
like 105 110 minutes, second ones Third ones get sort shorter
shorter, night goes last Cycles, just N2 REM
sleep cycle, takes less time, wake REM, sleep usually no
problem. Cognitively good go. fan sleep, trackers, uh sure, yeah
yeah? use one one on? don't take. don't. don't live life
best ones. Right now 70 effective staging sleep,
70, it’s okay, it’s okay, um. Take grain salt saying. Yeah tried
various ones, compare mattress based one a. actually wear ankle
instead wrist um find informative, um, colleague mine
Stanford Ali Crum, works mindset belief, effects. Um talk study
people often will buy us sense daytime wakefulness based
sleep score subjective score. words, told got poor
night's sleep, even got great night's sleep - course
measured sleep lab. able compare people report feeling
groggy opposite also true says 100 90 sleep score, people
go, feel great, even though might not slept well. speaks the. don't
want say placebo effect, sort belief effects woven score yeah
um. seems combining subjective objective data probably better,
believe trust physiology way body
telling feel, fact, used people insomnia weren't often
not believed put sleep lab look like slept great
wake morning say. Oh, didn't sleep well all, that’s
probably just came paper shows subcortical structures can
completely different sleep State cortical structures, measure
sleep lab. cortex might people say not sleep night
long, even though cortex saying. Oh no, great sleep
monitoring subcortical hypothalamus hippocampus Thalamus
structures sleep lab. Just can't access, unless depth electrodes,
nobody really wants right, requires holes skulls wires yeah wow. So,


mean last 50 plus years sleep science um it’s potentially flawed
way, recording guess be. analogy it’s
like recording surface ocean opposed depth ocean right
trying ascertain life moving deep there, brace uh colleagues
Stanford, sleep lab elsewhere uh. please just tell us, think scientists want
know truth, yeah yeah, nothing want know cortex doing.
mean cortex really important lot things, doesn't necessarily tell
lot really important parts brain terms sleep um,
hope fact great. think that’s possible paper.
look it, it’s pnas year detect subtle changes cortical EEG.
might able tell subcortical structures doing. Things like absolute
power sleep, spindle band, Sigma band change hippocampus
REM, sleep cortex sleep, spindle, State vice versa.
hope can gain people depth, electrodes animals depth
electrodes backwards machine, learn cortex might able tell us
subcritical structures cortical EEG interesting. going stimuli.
Yeah stay tuned. It’s going stimulus development new

00:43:19 Early Slow Wave Sleep & “Washout”, Normal Sleep Cycle & Night Owls

Technology always going assist scientific discovery, um one thing.
wanted ask architecture night's sleep um terms early part
night. Earlier mentioned washout debris um so-called lymphatic system.
think referring to. tell us little bit washout
occurs brain sleep? roles it’s thought serve
perhaps ways ensure happens ensure doesn't happen,
obviously want happen. Yeah yeah um right great question. talked
circadian clock certain things happen certain times. Well, one
things happens awake talking lot
plasticity, something learning today learning
changes synapses changes way proteins going folded
changed sleep, unfolds, process actually uses lot ATP power
um structure, fuel brain unfolds also proteins,
using them, that, first part night. first fall asleep
first 20 minutes building adenosine back ATP, that’s probably


power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

aware that? Can turn output locus ceruleus phases
sleep matter, things can cause ramping locus cerules
phase sleep? couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes guests
talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,

00:06:58 Sleep Phases, Perfect Night’s Sleep

Expanding again, that’s livemomentous.com Huberman now discussion Dr
Gina Poe, Dr Gino Poe, welcome. Thank you. really looking forward
conversation familiar work - know many people going
excited learn work relates sleep relates problem solving
creativity, addiction craving relapse. number important topics start
things off, love educate us bit thing familiar with,
yet us understand, sleep describe
Various phases sleep exist, distinguish perhaps frame within
context perfect night's sleep? Look like okay? long last
less, biology look like what? perfect night's sleep? Oh yeah,
that’s great question right, sleep really different wakefulness and, fact, can't
replaced state wakefulness able come far.
brain chemistry completely different different stages sleep
non-rem REM two major states sleep every animal studied far
seems States anyway. two states entirely different one
another too, even within non-rem. three states stage, one
slip first falling asleep. It’s dozing, kind interesting Rhythm
goes brain. It’s kind fast gamma Rhythm stage two,
really cool State. sort used ignore sleep researchers transient
State wakefulness Deep stage, three slow way, sleep,
impressively different then, REM, sleep. stage two talk


little bit Deep slow way sleep state, big, slow waves
sweep brain, now realize cleans brain. One things
big slow waves cleans. brain really important things
restore us um day wakefulness REM, sleep popular
that’s active dreams um. wake someone
REM, sleep almost always report dreams. Something really bizarre.
That’s called REM, sleep, rapid eye movement, sleep, four states sleep
human sleep cycle every 90 minutes go sleep,
say: 10. 10, 30. 11 o'clock, first REM, sleep period, comes hundred five
minutes fall asleep lasts 20 minutes. Actually, comes 95 minutes
last 10 15 minutes, start five per
night perfect night's sleep, four five. Something like that. Perfect night's sleep
seven half eight hours. really great study put people semi-
darkened room nothing, bed 12 hours every day month,
people initially because, sleep, deprived nation, slept
lot usual. Like 10 11 hours 12, leveled off week
two eight hours 15 minutes sleep, actually can't oversleep. mean
nothing else butt sleep round off average, eight hours
15 minutes night spend rest

00:10:32 Can Oversleep?

Time twiddling thumbs, humming Tunes, interesting daydreaming. want get back
Contour perfect night's sleep, intrigued idea people can't
oversleep often asked whether not can get much sleep whether not
sleeping long long excuse can make us groggy. next day anything
um one determine long sleep right average average
yeah? Well, that’s interesting different people need seem need different amounts
sleep, don't really even know exactly sleep for. need
know kind it’s it’s. know Mercury murky um, know lot things sleep
now us, don't know long things take. long need
sleep also just big question mark, people don't feel rested slept
nine hours people don't feel rested three four half, people
consistently deprive sleep sleeping four four
half hours night build cognitive deficit just builds time. nights


sleep deprivation, cognitive deficit have, need sleep
sleep recover. Now question um: can over? Can
oversleep right? Can sleep point it’s much? know growing
um high school. girlfriend's dad belief no one sleep
past 6 a.m, wake two children home. wake
kids house. sing sleeping regardless people
went, went sleep, always thought um, interesting mentality, yeah um,
that’s not terrible. Actually, will it'll put make sleepier
next night get bed time, it'll build homeostatic need wake
early um, don't think can oversleep, people sleep Lot like people
sleep nine hours, it’s probably indicative problem, because, fact,
lot different conditions, will cause sleep lot more, probably
interferes efficient sleep. efficiency sleep, find
sleep consistently nine hours plus every night, might want consult
doctor maybe else might be. cancer, sleep apnea
just affects lot people. sleep super inefficient
snoring lot know waking lot know every night.
might want sleep study just see sleep see else might
be, causing sleep much, wouldn't be. somebody sleeping nine ten
hours. know every while. mean, they're, consistently sleeping
nine hours, feel like need order function cognitively next day.
might sleep just not efficient might want look that’s
case interesting. Forgive anecdote, can't resist years ago went
acupuncturist um. gave red pills, don't know contain
uh-oh, took told help sleep fall
asleep 30 minutes taking them, incred incredibly excuse
vivid Dreams wake four five hours gone sleep feeling completely
rested something never really experienced interesting consistent basis. want
mass spec pills. still no idea whatsoever exactly
people thought perhaps GHB gamma hydroxybutyrate,
way, illegal drug. can kill you, it’s not a, not something want take um
anyway, if, ever someone can figure red pills um,
not red pill sort red pill. just red sleep pills. Interesting, mean
even placebo effect, Placebo extremely strong. So, although
don't know, really something red pills



00:14:50 Sleep Cycles, Sleep Spindles, “Falling” Asleep, Dreams & Memories

shout acupuncturists uh Eastern medicine um, return
idea architecture perfect night's sleep. said um, fall asleep.
first 90 minutes sleep REM, sleep, rapid eye movement. Sleep will arrive 95
minutes in. mean rest 90 minutes consumed slow wave
sleep, yeah, non-rem, sleep, okay, Sleep lightly asleep?
might dream us somehow thinking movement jolt
away, often happens early night. Yeah yeah. That’s first
stage stage, one stage two sleep stage: two sleep really cool,
something called sleep, spindles K complexes sleep spindles little bit
activity. That’s 10 15 Hertz frequency. It’s conversation thalamus
cortex, thalamus gateway Consciousness neocortex. know,
processes cognition um. it’s it’s. spindles called sleep spindles
wake state, will often report dream like hallucination style
dream. won't long dream report like you, REM sleep, will
hallucination state enduring. falling asleep one reasons call falling
asleep stage one stage two muscles relaxing part
brain, that’s conscious enough sort recognize relaxation will feel like
falling will jerk Awake often hallucination, it’s called hypnagotic hallucination will
feel like it'll include falling aspect will wake that’s really interesting me.
long felt sensation almost like dropping back head um, much
elevate feet just slightly tilt head back just slightly order go sleep, find
fall asleep much faster interesting, feel going fall, like almost gon
na, backward somersault. actually really like sensation usually
proceeds falling deeply yeah. That’s really interesting. somebody study
elevated feet yeah. little bit um body position sleep
washout talk early night um. got lighter stages sleep,
less rapid eye movement, sleep. can say dreams occur
say? First second um, know 90 minute cycles sleep. quite different
patterns sleep dreaming occur later night toward morning? Well,
okay, that’s interesting question. lot facets it. evidence
first four hours sleep important memory processing fact,
learned something new day experienced new sensory motor experience,
early sleep dreams will incorporate experience. Much later sleep
dreams later, memory gets Consolidated early structures,


hippocampus deep temporal lobe cortex distributed fashion. memory
seems move hippocampus cortex also dreams incorporate
memory also move later night. nobody knows why, does.
great study siddarta Ribeiro studied consolidation memories cortex
hippocampus cortex rat across period full day. Sleep
rats sleep daytime found subsequent Rim sleep period, moved
memory, hippocampus first first area, projects second
area. third area. can see memory moving

00:19:01 Tool: Growth Hormone Release & Sleep

Um throughout Sleep cool period, yeah cool, read
study. um number different hormones associated different stages
sleep. know melatonin hormone nighttime nighttime. makes sleepy
um growth hormone release occur sleep, growth
hormone release happens day, long night long, Deep, slow way sleep
get. first sleep cycle get big bolus growth, hormone release
men women equally, miss first deep, slow way sleep period,
also miss big bolus growth hormone release might get ultimately across
day, just much overall growth hormone release, endocrinologists will tell big
boluses different things little bit eeked time. well. know,
also big push synthesize proteins. that’s protein synthesis part
builds memories, example brain, happens first cycle sleep. don't
want miss that, especially learned something really big needs needs
synaptic space encode it. somebody miss first 90 minutes driving
yeah? say normally go sleep 10 pm 10 11 30
first phase sleep that’s growth hormone, big bolus growth
hormone released. mean go sleep instead 11, 30
midnight miss first phase sleep, not case get first phase
sleep just simply starting later? beautiful clock body. knows
things happen, it’s every cell body clock clocks
normally synchronized Circadian clocks synchronized, cells
ready respond onto growth hormone release particular time, Miss
it’s time relation melatonin also miss yeah might get growth
hormone release, it’s occurring time clock already moved


next phase, it’s it’s just clock thing. Yeah, don't think can overstate
importance just described honest, despite knowing bit
Sleep, research circadian biology. first time ever heard
normally go sleep particular time growth hormone released first
phase sleep can't simply initiate sleep bout later expect capture
first phase sleep yeah, that’s incredible think important um, many listeners
probably realizing, also highly actionable. means
fairly consistent bedtimes addition fairly consistent, wait times. right exactly
fact one

00:22:05 Adolescence; Early Sleep, Alcohol & Sleep Spindles

Best markers good neurological health get older, consistent, bedtimes, wow,
okay, um. don't want backtrack, write something think important
resolve resolve. going ask um people sleep, nine
hours perhaps reflecting issue. underlying issue, perhaps
teenager adolescent undergoing stage development lot
bodily brain growth. exception that, because, yes, don't recall sleeping ton
teenager, ton energy, know teenagers sleep lot yeah
like they'll, just sleep sleep sleep sleep: let Sleep sleep
sleep okay, can sleep okay, that’s one exception. just like babies?
Okay, developing something brain rest body. really
need sleep help. Organize mean sleep really hard work organizing
brains making develop right, deprive sleep will actually
also just like, like. said daily clock. also developmental clock
can miss developmental window don't let sleep extra like need
things inhibit: growth, hormone release components first stage sleep.
words, go sleep religiously, every night 10 pm things perhaps
preceding hours preceding day like ingest, caffeine alcohol, can make
first stage sleep less effective. Even going sleep time, alcohol
definitely will alcohol REM, sleep suppressant even suppresses
stage. Two transition REM sleep spindles sleep
spindles. didn't talk function yet, really important moving
memories cortex. It’s unique time hippocampus, sort like ram
brains, writes hard disk cortex it’s unique time


connected. don't want miss don't want miss REM sleep
also part consolidation process schema changing process alcohol
there. know go sleep, metabolized alcohol
put bodies, will affect sleep badly, probably fair say no ingestion
alcohol within four six hours preceding sleep, given half-life all,
better, know people refuse go way maybe little bit okay.
don't know dose response is, um studies there. can look
great yeah, still first stage sleep apologize slowing us down.
sounds like it’s

00:24:55 Middle Sleep States & REM, Schema, Waking Night

Incredibly important first phase sleep. second third 90 minute blocks
sleep? anything makes um unique? signature uh besides
fact come second third night, REM sleep?
later night get um also change hormones. know growth
hormone melatonin levels starting decline, hormones picking up.
really different stage also don't want shortchange think
that’s stage. Many studies showing times sleep
creativity can happen. That’s dreams can incorporate put together old new
things together new way um schema built time. um
yeah. can change minds best phases sleep. elaborate
little bit schema? No one, don't think anyone podcast ever discussed.
Schema little bit familiar schema courses psychology, it’s
while. maybe just refresh mind everyone. Well, it’s it’s still concept
right, think schema um like schema Christmas right.
kinds ideas sew together call Christmas holiday season northern
hemisphere. It’s cold. Santa Claus reindeer jingle bells, even things
false, normally associate Christmas presents family gathering
stuff sewn together one thread linking all, can just
give list words um none contain word Christmas
ask people later um, know, give another list words include word
Christmas say: oh yeah. word minds brought
word Christmas, it’s part whole schema. that’s it’s sort
related, lot related Concepts. guess think it, sort like desktop


computer um scare people, it’s just ton folders yeah,
folder names means something clear specific me. Right inside
folders collections things make sense terms batched kind
one way, exactly? No that’s great way think REM sleep
later parts night transition REM, that’s computer
brain opening folders comparing documents. Seeing, anything same?
two documents look much same, little bit difference
can. can link conceptually that’s probably one origins creativity
finding things related, maybe just linked little bit, can find link
strengthen it. it, know, makes schema interesting different, interesting.
Um. Many people, including myself, tend wake up, maybe middle
night use restroom, tried drink less fluid going sleep I've. heard
also um impulse urinate - forgive topic, lot people deal this,
impulse urinate also dictated quickly drink fluid, not just total volume.
switched sipping fluids slowly. last beverage day, seems
help, point think lot people wake middle
night oftentimes use restroom oftentimes just around 3 A.M might
minutes, hopefully not phone viewing Bright Light, can cause
wakefulness go back sleep. known detriment middle
night waking consider normal feature people's sleep architecture?
think shouldn't worry it. Actually, think know sleep really incredibly well
homeostatically regulated really don't worry much sleeping long
you're, not intentionally depriving sleep something really rewarding
exciting, even stressful body deprives lot things
talking about, don't worry it, um, it’s absolutely normal wake up, least
middle night go bathroom long can get back
sleep reasonable amount Time, um, know, even takes hour, don't
worry long lifestyle allows make sleep
either next morning next night going bed little earlier. understand
correctly, little bit asymmetry sleep catching first phase sleep, it’s
like either get don't, get going sleep essentially
time night, maybe plus minus 15 minutes yeah, then, wake
middle night go back sleep, cannot catch up, can gather sleep
gotten had. just slept whole way night. right, yeah,
yeah, okay, yeah and, don't know actually answer whether not sleep
middle early sleep late sleep fact different another reason,


whether depriving sleep say one 2 30 morning bad
different way. don't know well, suppose experiment case,
tend wake per night sort come recognize part normal
sleep architecture, don't obsess it. notice go back sleep
especially toward mourning sleep

00:30:33 Deep Sleep, Dreams & Senses

incredibly deep, dreams incredibly Vivid. don't always remember them,
unique, perhaps architecture dreams sleep say last third
night second half night right yeah. second half night,
longer REM, sleep periods considered deepest sleep. Even though
slow wave sleep, big, slow wave considered deep. deep yeah, call slow, wave
sleep, deep sleep REM sleep rapid mean, now telling REM sleep
actually deeper sleep. Okay, needs new nomenclature, sleep, researchers!
No, no, please. reason cause slow wave sleep deep sleep it’s
difficult arouse people state arouse state,
often confused just want go back sleep can go back pretty
Easily, arouse someone REM, sleep likely report something
really kind almost like wakefulness. vivid, fact, give someone
none threatening kind stimulation, like somebody dropping keys ping,
something like that, instead waking volume will wake someone non-
rim sleep, REM, sleeping instead lengthen amount time make even
dense rapid eye movements dense often people will incorporate
sound dreams. body brain somehow conscious um
sound, heard also smells can even make dreams REM sleep,
doesn't arouse us. doesn't arouse us often yeah interesting, maybe one
reasons REM sleep deeper especially adults older people deep slow
wave sleep goes away. it’s not deep. It’s not big slow waves aren't large,
probably problematic, not sure, REM sleep. becomes
deepest stage actually children, it’s kind toss-up it’s really hard wake
up. deep, slow wave sleep fact fire alarms, don't wake even
really loud fire alarms state sleep. that’s trying change fire
alarms that, instead something kids don't associate anything like whatever
don't associate says name something else may less loud


Salient will wake up. don't know carried sleeping children
car. don't know want children start waking sleep, that’s
one best things get home kids asleep back seat. can
literally throw shoulder gently course, yes put sleep in,
completely

paralyzed that’s really good, that’s time actively dreaming
storyline dreams hurt - actually really cut off outside
world. terms know, responding say table window door,
different sleepwalking, slow wave sleep slowly sleep.
sleepwalking mixture sleep wakefulness, actually will respond


door. can cook full meal, drive car, deep slowly sleep, it’s scary,
never know going do. don't voluntary voluntary control
it. no conscious control it, can actually safely navigate
situations sleepwalking actually conversation, although may not make much
sense sleep talking REM, sleep you're, not processing outside world
instead, acting Dreams, things like walking
plate, glass window falling off know stairs things like that. really
want muscles inactivated REM, sleep. Otherwise, will act
dreams really hurt bed partner. sleep talking talking
sleep um? don't know many relationships um saved sleep talking,
guessing destroyed guessing um talking sleep
meaning perhaps no meaning just dreams meaning no
meaning, recall yeah not take sleep talking seriously, no matter people
say, doesn't necessarily reflect truth, it’s not like truthful
sleep talking, just saved number relationships. Um, not directing anyone
particular, guarantee just

00:36:47 Alarm Clock & Grogginess; Sleep Trackers, Brain & Sleep

um noted um people start approach mourning time normally
wake up, heard it’s important to, possible, complete one 90-minute
Cycles prior waking up. is, set alarm halfway one 90
minute cycles come late night sleep, can lead um rather groggy
patterns waking um. just ask directly: use alarm clock? not um,
thankfully line work doesn't require normally anything
particular time. unless catch plane, always set
alarm just case well. fellow academic, can tell you. plenty punishing
features academic scientist um offset fact don't
use alarm clock, nice can often set schedule.
recommend that, possible, people not use alarm clock yeah? Absolutely can
just listen body wake need wake up? great um
um. One reasons grogginess called Sleep inertia
wake wrong state, um deep, slow wave. Sleep liken
uh like washing machine cycle. 90-minute Cycles, like washing machine cycle
um first part, add water right clothes soaking wet. don't


want open washing machine try function put wear around,
soaking, wet full soap. wait cycle
can well. Actually, put dryer too, want wear
yeah can function. just takes little clothes brain dry out,
can actually function well, um, it’s better wait whole cycle. complete
that’s want set 90 90 minute alarm clock that’s around 90
minutes, first stage sleep, first cycle sleep, actually little longer
like 105 110 minutes, second ones Third ones get sort shorter
shorter, night goes last Cycles, just N2 REM
sleep cycle, takes less time, wake REM, sleep usually no
problem. Cognitively good go. fan sleep, trackers, uh sure, yeah
yeah? use one one on? don't take. don't. don't live life
best ones. Right now 70 effective staging sleep,
70, it’s okay, it’s okay, um. Take grain salt saying. Yeah tried
various ones, compare mattress based one a. actually wear ankle
instead wrist um find informative, um, colleague mine
Stanford Ali Crum, works mindset belief, effects. Um talk study
people often will buy us sense daytime wakefulness based
sleep score subjective score. words, told got poor
night's sleep, even got great night's sleep - course
measured sleep lab. able compare people report feeling
groggy opposite also true says 100 90 sleep score, people
go, feel great, even though might not slept well. speaks the. don't
want say placebo effect, sort belief effects woven score yeah
um. seems combining subjective objective data probably better,
believe trust physiology way body
telling feel, fact, used people insomnia weren't often
not believed put sleep lab look like slept great
wake morning say. Oh, didn't sleep well all, that’s
probably just came paper shows subcortical structures can
completely different sleep State cortical structures, measure
sleep lab. cortex might people say not sleep night
long, even though cortex saying. Oh no, great sleep
monitoring subcortical hypothalamus hippocampus Thalamus
structures sleep lab. Just can't access, unless depth electrodes,
nobody really wants right, requires holes skulls wires yeah wow. So,


mean last 50 plus years sleep science um it’s potentially flawed
way, recording guess be. analogy it’s
like recording surface ocean opposed depth ocean right
trying ascertain life moving deep there, brace uh colleagues
Stanford, sleep lab elsewhere uh. please just tell us, think scientists want
know truth, yeah yeah, nothing want know cortex doing.
mean cortex really important lot things, doesn't necessarily tell
lot really important parts brain terms sleep um,
hope fact great. think that’s possible paper.
look it, it’s pnas year detect subtle changes cortical EEG.
might able tell subcortical structures doing. Things like absolute
power sleep, spindle band, Sigma band change hippocampus
REM, sleep cortex sleep, spindle, State vice versa.
hope can gain people depth, electrodes animals depth
electrodes backwards machine, learn cortex might able tell us
subcritical structures cortical EEG interesting. going stimuli.
Yeah stay tuned. It’s going stimulus development new

00:43:19 Early Slow Wave Sleep & “Washout”, Normal Sleep Cycle & Night Owls

Technology always going assist scientific discovery, um one thing.
wanted ask architecture night's sleep um terms early part
night. Earlier mentioned washout debris um so-called lymphatic system.
think referring to. tell us little bit washout
occurs brain sleep? roles it’s thought serve
perhaps ways ensure happens ensure doesn't happen,
obviously want happen. Yeah yeah um right great question. talked
circadian clock certain things happen certain times. Well, one
things happens awake talking lot
plasticity, something learning today learning
changes synapses changes way proteins going folded
changed sleep, unfolds, process actually uses lot ATP power
um structure, fuel brain unfolds also proteins,
using them, that, first part night. first fall asleep
first 20 minutes building adenosine back ATP, that’s probably


power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

aware that? Can turn output locus ceruleus phases
sleep matter, things can cause ramping locus cerules
phase sleep? couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes guests
talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

little bit Deep slow way sleep state, big, slow waves
sweep brain, now realize cleans brain. One things
big slow waves cleans. brain really important things
restore us um day wakefulness REM, sleep popular
that’s active dreams um. wake someone
REM, sleep almost always report dreams. Something really bizarre.
That’s called REM, sleep, rapid eye movement, sleep, four states sleep
human sleep cycle every 90 minutes go sleep,
say: 10. 10, 30. 11 o'clock, first REM, sleep period, comes hundred five
minutes fall asleep lasts 20 minutes. Actually, comes 95 minutes
last 10 15 minutes, start five per
night perfect night's sleep, four five. Something like that. Perfect night's sleep
seven half eight hours. really great study put people semi-
darkened room nothing, bed 12 hours every day month,
people initially because, sleep, deprived nation, slept
lot usual. Like 10 11 hours 12, leveled off week
two eight hours 15 minutes sleep, actually can't oversleep. mean
nothing else butt sleep round off average, eight hours
15 minutes night spend rest

00:10:32 Can Oversleep?

Time twiddling thumbs, humming Tunes, interesting daydreaming. want get back
Contour perfect night's sleep, intrigued idea people can't
oversleep often asked whether not can get much sleep whether not
sleeping long long excuse can make us groggy. next day anything
um one determine long sleep right average average
yeah? Well, that’s interesting different people need seem need different amounts
sleep, don't really even know exactly sleep for. need
know kind it’s it’s. know Mercury murky um, know lot things sleep
now us, don't know long things take. long need
sleep also just big question mark, people don't feel rested slept
nine hours people don't feel rested three four half, people
consistently deprive sleep sleeping four four
half hours night build cognitive deficit just builds time. nights


sleep deprivation, cognitive deficit have, need sleep
sleep recover. Now question um: can over? Can
oversleep right? Can sleep point it’s much? know growing
um high school. girlfriend's dad belief no one sleep
past 6 a.m, wake two children home. wake
kids house. sing sleeping regardless people
went, went sleep, always thought um, interesting mentality, yeah um,
that’s not terrible. Actually, will it'll put make sleepier
next night get bed time, it'll build homeostatic need wake
early um, don't think can oversleep, people sleep Lot like people
sleep nine hours, it’s probably indicative problem, because, fact,
lot different conditions, will cause sleep lot more, probably
interferes efficient sleep. efficiency sleep, find
sleep consistently nine hours plus every night, might want consult
doctor maybe else might be. cancer, sleep apnea
just affects lot people. sleep super inefficient
snoring lot know waking lot know every night.
might want sleep study just see sleep see else might
be, causing sleep much, wouldn't be. somebody sleeping nine ten
hours. know every while. mean, they're, consistently sleeping
nine hours, feel like need order function cognitively next day.
might sleep just not efficient might want look that’s
case interesting. Forgive anecdote, can't resist years ago went
acupuncturist um. gave red pills, don't know contain
uh-oh, took told help sleep fall
asleep 30 minutes taking them, incred incredibly excuse
vivid Dreams wake four five hours gone sleep feeling completely
rested something never really experienced interesting consistent basis. want
mass spec pills. still no idea whatsoever exactly
people thought perhaps GHB gamma hydroxybutyrate,
way, illegal drug. can kill you, it’s not a, not something want take um
anyway, if, ever someone can figure red pills um,
not red pill sort red pill. just red sleep pills. Interesting, mean
even placebo effect, Placebo extremely strong. So, although
don't know, really something red pills



00:14:50 Sleep Cycles, Sleep Spindles, “Falling” Asleep, Dreams & Memories

shout acupuncturists uh Eastern medicine um, return
idea architecture perfect night's sleep. said um, fall asleep.
first 90 minutes sleep REM, sleep, rapid eye movement. Sleep will arrive 95
minutes in. mean rest 90 minutes consumed slow wave
sleep, yeah, non-rem, sleep, okay, Sleep lightly asleep?
might dream us somehow thinking movement jolt
away, often happens early night. Yeah yeah. That’s first
stage stage, one stage two sleep stage: two sleep really cool,
something called sleep, spindles K complexes sleep spindles little bit
activity. That’s 10 15 Hertz frequency. It’s conversation thalamus
cortex, thalamus gateway Consciousness neocortex. know,
processes cognition um. it’s it’s. spindles called sleep spindles
wake state, will often report dream like hallucination style
dream. won't long dream report like you, REM sleep, will
hallucination state enduring. falling asleep one reasons call falling
asleep stage one stage two muscles relaxing part
brain, that’s conscious enough sort recognize relaxation will feel like
falling will jerk Awake often hallucination, it’s called hypnagotic hallucination will
feel like it'll include falling aspect will wake that’s really interesting me.
long felt sensation almost like dropping back head um, much
elevate feet just slightly tilt head back just slightly order go sleep, find
fall asleep much faster interesting, feel going fall, like almost gon
na, backward somersault. actually really like sensation usually
proceeds falling deeply yeah. That’s really interesting. somebody study
elevated feet yeah. little bit um body position sleep
washout talk early night um. got lighter stages sleep,
less rapid eye movement, sleep. can say dreams occur
say? First second um, know 90 minute cycles sleep. quite different
patterns sleep dreaming occur later night toward morning? Well,
okay, that’s interesting question. lot facets it. evidence
first four hours sleep important memory processing fact,
learned something new day experienced new sensory motor experience,
early sleep dreams will incorporate experience. Much later sleep
dreams later, memory gets Consolidated early structures,


hippocampus deep temporal lobe cortex distributed fashion. memory
seems move hippocampus cortex also dreams incorporate
memory also move later night. nobody knows why, does.
great study siddarta Ribeiro studied consolidation memories cortex
hippocampus cortex rat across period full day. Sleep
rats sleep daytime found subsequent Rim sleep period, moved
memory, hippocampus first first area, projects second
area. third area. can see memory moving

00:19:01 Tool: Growth Hormone Release & Sleep

Um throughout Sleep cool period, yeah cool, read
study. um number different hormones associated different stages
sleep. know melatonin hormone nighttime nighttime. makes sleepy
um growth hormone release occur sleep, growth
hormone release happens day, long night long, Deep, slow way sleep
get. first sleep cycle get big bolus growth, hormone release
men women equally, miss first deep, slow way sleep period,
also miss big bolus growth hormone release might get ultimately across
day, just much overall growth hormone release, endocrinologists will tell big
boluses different things little bit eeked time. well. know,
also big push synthesize proteins. that’s protein synthesis part
builds memories, example brain, happens first cycle sleep. don't
want miss that, especially learned something really big needs needs
synaptic space encode it. somebody miss first 90 minutes driving
yeah? say normally go sleep 10 pm 10 11 30
first phase sleep that’s growth hormone, big bolus growth
hormone released. mean go sleep instead 11, 30
midnight miss first phase sleep, not case get first phase
sleep just simply starting later? beautiful clock body. knows
things happen, it’s every cell body clock clocks
normally synchronized Circadian clocks synchronized, cells
ready respond onto growth hormone release particular time, Miss
it’s time relation melatonin also miss yeah might get growth
hormone release, it’s occurring time clock already moved


next phase, it’s it’s just clock thing. Yeah, don't think can overstate
importance just described honest, despite knowing bit
Sleep, research circadian biology. first time ever heard
normally go sleep particular time growth hormone released first
phase sleep can't simply initiate sleep bout later expect capture
first phase sleep yeah, that’s incredible think important um, many listeners
probably realizing, also highly actionable. means
fairly consistent bedtimes addition fairly consistent, wait times. right exactly
fact one

00:22:05 Adolescence; Early Sleep, Alcohol & Sleep Spindles

Best markers good neurological health get older, consistent, bedtimes, wow,
okay, um. don't want backtrack, write something think important
resolve resolve. going ask um people sleep, nine
hours perhaps reflecting issue. underlying issue, perhaps
teenager adolescent undergoing stage development lot
bodily brain growth. exception that, because, yes, don't recall sleeping ton
teenager, ton energy, know teenagers sleep lot yeah
like they'll, just sleep sleep sleep sleep: let Sleep sleep
sleep okay, can sleep okay, that’s one exception. just like babies?
Okay, developing something brain rest body. really
need sleep help. Organize mean sleep really hard work organizing
brains making develop right, deprive sleep will actually
also just like, like. said daily clock. also developmental clock
can miss developmental window don't let sleep extra like need
things inhibit: growth, hormone release components first stage sleep.
words, go sleep religiously, every night 10 pm things perhaps
preceding hours preceding day like ingest, caffeine alcohol, can make
first stage sleep less effective. Even going sleep time, alcohol
definitely will alcohol REM, sleep suppressant even suppresses
stage. Two transition REM sleep spindles sleep
spindles. didn't talk function yet, really important moving
memories cortex. It’s unique time hippocampus, sort like ram
brains, writes hard disk cortex it’s unique time


connected. don't want miss don't want miss REM sleep
also part consolidation process schema changing process alcohol
there. know go sleep, metabolized alcohol
put bodies, will affect sleep badly, probably fair say no ingestion
alcohol within four six hours preceding sleep, given half-life all,
better, know people refuse go way maybe little bit okay.
don't know dose response is, um studies there. can look
great yeah, still first stage sleep apologize slowing us down.
sounds like it’s

00:24:55 Middle Sleep States & REM, Schema, Waking Night

Incredibly important first phase sleep. second third 90 minute blocks
sleep? anything makes um unique? signature uh besides
fact come second third night, REM sleep?
later night get um also change hormones. know growth
hormone melatonin levels starting decline, hormones picking up.
really different stage also don't want shortchange think
that’s stage. Many studies showing times sleep
creativity can happen. That’s dreams can incorporate put together old new
things together new way um schema built time. um
yeah. can change minds best phases sleep. elaborate
little bit schema? No one, don't think anyone podcast ever discussed.
Schema little bit familiar schema courses psychology, it’s
while. maybe just refresh mind everyone. Well, it’s it’s still concept
right, think schema um like schema Christmas right.
kinds ideas sew together call Christmas holiday season northern
hemisphere. It’s cold. Santa Claus reindeer jingle bells, even things
false, normally associate Christmas presents family gathering
stuff sewn together one thread linking all, can just
give list words um none contain word Christmas
ask people later um, know, give another list words include word
Christmas say: oh yeah. word minds brought
word Christmas, it’s part whole schema. that’s it’s sort
related, lot related Concepts. guess think it, sort like desktop


computer um scare people, it’s just ton folders yeah,
folder names means something clear specific me. Right inside
folders collections things make sense terms batched kind
one way, exactly? No that’s great way think REM sleep
later parts night transition REM, that’s computer
brain opening folders comparing documents. Seeing, anything same?
two documents look much same, little bit difference
can. can link conceptually that’s probably one origins creativity
finding things related, maybe just linked little bit, can find link
strengthen it. it, know, makes schema interesting different, interesting.
Um. Many people, including myself, tend wake up, maybe middle
night use restroom, tried drink less fluid going sleep I've. heard
also um impulse urinate - forgive topic, lot people deal this,
impulse urinate also dictated quickly drink fluid, not just total volume.
switched sipping fluids slowly. last beverage day, seems
help, point think lot people wake middle
night oftentimes use restroom oftentimes just around 3 A.M might
minutes, hopefully not phone viewing Bright Light, can cause
wakefulness go back sleep. known detriment middle
night waking consider normal feature people's sleep architecture?
think shouldn't worry it. Actually, think know sleep really incredibly well
homeostatically regulated really don't worry much sleeping long
you're, not intentionally depriving sleep something really rewarding
exciting, even stressful body deprives lot things
talking about, don't worry it, um, it’s absolutely normal wake up, least
middle night go bathroom long can get back
sleep reasonable amount Time, um, know, even takes hour, don't
worry long lifestyle allows make sleep
either next morning next night going bed little earlier. understand
correctly, little bit asymmetry sleep catching first phase sleep, it’s
like either get don't, get going sleep essentially
time night, maybe plus minus 15 minutes yeah, then, wake
middle night go back sleep, cannot catch up, can gather sleep
gotten had. just slept whole way night. right, yeah,
yeah, okay, yeah and, don't know actually answer whether not sleep
middle early sleep late sleep fact different another reason,


whether depriving sleep say one 2 30 morning bad
different way. don't know well, suppose experiment case,
tend wake per night sort come recognize part normal
sleep architecture, don't obsess it. notice go back sleep
especially toward mourning sleep

00:30:33 Deep Sleep, Dreams & Senses

incredibly deep, dreams incredibly Vivid. don't always remember them,
unique, perhaps architecture dreams sleep say last third
night second half night right yeah. second half night,
longer REM, sleep periods considered deepest sleep. Even though
slow wave sleep, big, slow wave considered deep. deep yeah, call slow, wave
sleep, deep sleep REM sleep rapid mean, now telling REM sleep
actually deeper sleep. Okay, needs new nomenclature, sleep, researchers!
No, no, please. reason cause slow wave sleep deep sleep it’s
difficult arouse people state arouse state,
often confused just want go back sleep can go back pretty
Easily, arouse someone REM, sleep likely report something
really kind almost like wakefulness. vivid, fact, give someone
none threatening kind stimulation, like somebody dropping keys ping,
something like that, instead waking volume will wake someone non-
rim sleep, REM, sleeping instead lengthen amount time make even
dense rapid eye movements dense often people will incorporate
sound dreams. body brain somehow conscious um
sound, heard also smells can even make dreams REM sleep,
doesn't arouse us. doesn't arouse us often yeah interesting, maybe one
reasons REM sleep deeper especially adults older people deep slow
wave sleep goes away. it’s not deep. It’s not big slow waves aren't large,
probably problematic, not sure, REM sleep. becomes
deepest stage actually children, it’s kind toss-up it’s really hard wake
up. deep, slow wave sleep fact fire alarms, don't wake even
really loud fire alarms state sleep. that’s trying change fire
alarms that, instead something kids don't associate anything like whatever
don't associate says name something else may less loud


Salient will wake up. don't know carried sleeping children
car. don't know want children start waking sleep, that’s
one best things get home kids asleep back seat. can
literally throw shoulder gently course, yes put sleep in,
completely

volume proportion rapid eye movement sleep second half night relates
elaborate dreams. paralyzed REM, sleep, correct! Yes, normally it’s
paralyzed that’s really good, that’s time actively dreaming
storyline dreams hurt - actually really cut off outside
world. terms know, responding say table window door,
different sleepwalking, slow wave sleep slowly sleep.
sleepwalking mixture sleep wakefulness, actually will respond


door. can cook full meal, drive car, deep slowly sleep, it’s scary,
never know going do. don't voluntary voluntary control
it. no conscious control it, can actually safely navigate
situations sleepwalking actually conversation, although may not make much
sense sleep talking REM, sleep you're, not processing outside world
instead, acting Dreams, things like walking
plate, glass window falling off know stairs things like that. really
want muscles inactivated REM, sleep. Otherwise, will act
dreams really hurt bed partner. sleep talking talking
sleep um? don't know many relationships um saved sleep talking,
guessing destroyed guessing um talking sleep
meaning perhaps no meaning just dreams meaning no
meaning, recall yeah not take sleep talking seriously, no matter people
say, doesn't necessarily reflect truth, it’s not like truthful
sleep talking, just saved number relationships. Um, not directing anyone
particular, guarantee just

00:36:47 Alarm Clock & Grogginess; Sleep Trackers, Brain & Sleep

um noted um people start approach mourning time normally
wake up, heard it’s important to, possible, complete one 90-minute
Cycles prior waking up. is, set alarm halfway one 90
minute cycles come late night sleep, can lead um rather groggy
patterns waking um. just ask directly: use alarm clock? not um,
thankfully line work doesn't require normally anything
particular time. unless catch plane, always set
alarm just case well. fellow academic, can tell you. plenty punishing
features academic scientist um offset fact don't
use alarm clock, nice can often set schedule.
recommend that, possible, people not use alarm clock yeah? Absolutely can
just listen body wake need wake up? great um
um. One reasons grogginess called Sleep inertia
wake wrong state, um deep, slow wave. Sleep liken
uh like washing machine cycle. 90-minute Cycles, like washing machine cycle
um first part, add water right clothes soaking wet. don't


want open washing machine try function put wear around,
soaking, wet full soap. wait cycle
can well. Actually, put dryer too, want wear
yeah can function. just takes little clothes brain dry out,
can actually function well, um, it’s better wait whole cycle. complete
that’s want set 90 90 minute alarm clock that’s around 90
minutes, first stage sleep, first cycle sleep, actually little longer
like 105 110 minutes, second ones Third ones get sort shorter
shorter, night goes last Cycles, just N2 REM
sleep cycle, takes less time, wake REM, sleep usually no
problem. Cognitively good go. fan sleep, trackers, uh sure, yeah
yeah? use one one on? don't take. don't. don't live life
best ones. Right now 70 effective staging sleep,
70, it’s okay, it’s okay, um. Take grain salt saying. Yeah tried
various ones, compare mattress based one a. actually wear ankle
instead wrist um find informative, um, colleague mine
Stanford Ali Crum, works mindset belief, effects. Um talk study
people often will buy us sense daytime wakefulness based
sleep score subjective score. words, told got poor
night's sleep, even got great night's sleep - course
measured sleep lab. able compare people report feeling
groggy opposite also true says 100 90 sleep score, people
go, feel great, even though might not slept well. speaks the. don't
want say placebo effect, sort belief effects woven score yeah
um. seems combining subjective objective data probably better,
believe trust physiology way body
telling feel, fact, used people insomnia weren't often
not believed put sleep lab look like slept great
wake morning say. Oh, didn't sleep well all, that’s
probably just came paper shows subcortical structures can
completely different sleep State cortical structures, measure
sleep lab. cortex might people say not sleep night
long, even though cortex saying. Oh no, great sleep
monitoring subcortical hypothalamus hippocampus Thalamus
structures sleep lab. Just can't access, unless depth electrodes,
nobody really wants right, requires holes skulls wires yeah wow. So,


mean last 50 plus years sleep science um it’s potentially flawed
way, recording guess be. analogy it’s
like recording surface ocean opposed depth ocean right
trying ascertain life moving deep there, brace uh colleagues
Stanford, sleep lab elsewhere uh. please just tell us, think scientists want
know truth, yeah yeah, nothing want know cortex doing.
mean cortex really important lot things, doesn't necessarily tell
lot really important parts brain terms sleep um,
hope fact great. think that’s possible paper.
look it, it’s pnas year detect subtle changes cortical EEG.
might able tell subcortical structures doing. Things like absolute
power sleep, spindle band, Sigma band change hippocampus
REM, sleep cortex sleep, spindle, State vice versa.
hope can gain people depth, electrodes animals depth
electrodes backwards machine, learn cortex might able tell us
subcritical structures cortical EEG interesting. going stimuli.
Yeah stay tuned. It’s going stimulus development new

00:43:19 Early Slow Wave Sleep & “Washout”, Normal Sleep Cycle & Night Owls

Technology always going assist scientific discovery, um one thing.
wanted ask architecture night's sleep um terms early part
night. Earlier mentioned washout debris um so-called lymphatic system.
think referring to. tell us little bit washout
occurs brain sleep? roles it’s thought serve
perhaps ways ensure happens ensure doesn't happen,
obviously want happen. Yeah yeah um right great question. talked
circadian clock certain things happen certain times. Well, one
things happens awake talking lot
plasticity, something learning today learning
changes synapses changes way proteins going folded
changed sleep, unfolds, process actually uses lot ATP power
um structure, fuel brain unfolds also proteins,
using them, that, first part night. first fall asleep
first 20 minutes building adenosine back ATP, that’s probably


power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

aware that? Can turn output locus ceruleus phases
sleep matter, things can cause ramping locus cerules
phase sleep? couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes guests
talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

sleep deprivation, cognitive deficit have, need sleep
sleep recover. Now question um: can over? Can
oversleep right? Can sleep point it’s much? know growing
um high school. girlfriend's dad belief no one sleep
past 6 a.m, wake two children home. wake
kids house. sing sleeping regardless people
went, went sleep, always thought um, interesting mentality, yeah um,
that’s not terrible. Actually, will it'll put make sleepier
next night get bed time, it'll build homeostatic need wake
early um, don't think can oversleep, people sleep Lot like people
sleep nine hours, it’s probably indicative problem, because, fact,
lot different conditions, will cause sleep lot more, probably
interferes efficient sleep. efficiency sleep, find
sleep consistently nine hours plus every night, might want consult
doctor maybe else might be. cancer, sleep apnea
just affects lot people. sleep super inefficient
snoring lot know waking lot know every night.
might want sleep study just see sleep see else might
be, causing sleep much, wouldn't be. somebody sleeping nine ten
hours. know every while. mean, they're, consistently sleeping
nine hours, feel like need order function cognitively next day.
might sleep just not efficient might want look that’s
case interesting. Forgive anecdote, can't resist years ago went
acupuncturist um. gave red pills, don't know contain
uh-oh, took told help sleep fall
asleep 30 minutes taking them, incred incredibly excuse
vivid Dreams wake four five hours gone sleep feeling completely
rested something never really experienced interesting consistent basis. want
mass spec pills. still no idea whatsoever exactly
people thought perhaps GHB gamma hydroxybutyrate,
way, illegal drug. can kill you, it’s not a, not something want take um
anyway, if, ever someone can figure red pills um,
not red pill sort red pill. just red sleep pills. Interesting, mean
even placebo effect, Placebo extremely strong. So, although
don't know, really something red pills



00:14:50 Sleep Cycles, Sleep Spindles, “Falling” Asleep, Dreams & Memories

shout acupuncturists uh Eastern medicine um, return
idea architecture perfect night's sleep. said um, fall asleep.
first 90 minutes sleep REM, sleep, rapid eye movement. Sleep will arrive 95
minutes in. mean rest 90 minutes consumed slow wave
sleep, yeah, non-rem, sleep, okay, Sleep lightly asleep?
might dream us somehow thinking movement jolt
away, often happens early night. Yeah yeah. That’s first
stage stage, one stage two sleep stage: two sleep really cool,
something called sleep, spindles K complexes sleep spindles little bit
activity. That’s 10 15 Hertz frequency. It’s conversation thalamus
cortex, thalamus gateway Consciousness neocortex. know,
processes cognition um. it’s it’s. spindles called sleep spindles
wake state, will often report dream like hallucination style
dream. won't long dream report like you, REM sleep, will
hallucination state enduring. falling asleep one reasons call falling
asleep stage one stage two muscles relaxing part
brain, that’s conscious enough sort recognize relaxation will feel like
falling will jerk Awake often hallucination, it’s called hypnagotic hallucination will
feel like it'll include falling aspect will wake that’s really interesting me.
long felt sensation almost like dropping back head um, much
elevate feet just slightly tilt head back just slightly order go sleep, find
fall asleep much faster interesting, feel going fall, like almost gon
na, backward somersault. actually really like sensation usually
proceeds falling deeply yeah. That’s really interesting. somebody study
elevated feet yeah. little bit um body position sleep
washout talk early night um. got lighter stages sleep,
less rapid eye movement, sleep. can say dreams occur
say? First second um, know 90 minute cycles sleep. quite different
patterns sleep dreaming occur later night toward morning? Well,
okay, that’s interesting question. lot facets it. evidence
first four hours sleep important memory processing fact,
learned something new day experienced new sensory motor experience,
early sleep dreams will incorporate experience. Much later sleep
dreams later, memory gets Consolidated early structures,


hippocampus deep temporal lobe cortex distributed fashion. memory
seems move hippocampus cortex also dreams incorporate
memory also move later night. nobody knows why, does.
great study siddarta Ribeiro studied consolidation memories cortex
hippocampus cortex rat across period full day. Sleep
rats sleep daytime found subsequent Rim sleep period, moved
memory, hippocampus first first area, projects second
area. third area. can see memory moving

00:19:01 Tool: Growth Hormone Release & Sleep

Um throughout Sleep cool period, yeah cool, read
study. um number different hormones associated different stages
sleep. know melatonin hormone nighttime nighttime. makes sleepy
um growth hormone release occur sleep, growth
hormone release happens day, long night long, Deep, slow way sleep
get. first sleep cycle get big bolus growth, hormone release
men women equally, miss first deep, slow way sleep period,
also miss big bolus growth hormone release might get ultimately across
day, just much overall growth hormone release, endocrinologists will tell big
boluses different things little bit eeked time. well. know,
also big push synthesize proteins. that’s protein synthesis part
builds memories, example brain, happens first cycle sleep. don't
want miss that, especially learned something really big needs needs
synaptic space encode it. somebody miss first 90 minutes driving
yeah? say normally go sleep 10 pm 10 11 30
first phase sleep that’s growth hormone, big bolus growth
hormone released. mean go sleep instead 11, 30
midnight miss first phase sleep, not case get first phase
sleep just simply starting later? beautiful clock body. knows
things happen, it’s every cell body clock clocks
normally synchronized Circadian clocks synchronized, cells
ready respond onto growth hormone release particular time, Miss
it’s time relation melatonin also miss yeah might get growth
hormone release, it’s occurring time clock already moved


next phase, it’s it’s just clock thing. Yeah, don't think can overstate
importance just described honest, despite knowing bit
Sleep, research circadian biology. first time ever heard
normally go sleep particular time growth hormone released first
phase sleep can't simply initiate sleep bout later expect capture
first phase sleep yeah, that’s incredible think important um, many listeners
probably realizing, also highly actionable. means
fairly consistent bedtimes addition fairly consistent, wait times. right exactly
fact one

00:22:05 Adolescence; Early Sleep, Alcohol & Sleep Spindles

Best markers good neurological health get older, consistent, bedtimes, wow,
okay, um. don't want backtrack, write something think important
resolve resolve. going ask um people sleep, nine
hours perhaps reflecting issue. underlying issue, perhaps
teenager adolescent undergoing stage development lot
bodily brain growth. exception that, because, yes, don't recall sleeping ton
teenager, ton energy, know teenagers sleep lot yeah
like they'll, just sleep sleep sleep sleep: let Sleep sleep
sleep okay, can sleep okay, that’s one exception. just like babies?
Okay, developing something brain rest body. really
need sleep help. Organize mean sleep really hard work organizing
brains making develop right, deprive sleep will actually
also just like, like. said daily clock. also developmental clock
can miss developmental window don't let sleep extra like need
things inhibit: growth, hormone release components first stage sleep.
words, go sleep religiously, every night 10 pm things perhaps
preceding hours preceding day like ingest, caffeine alcohol, can make
first stage sleep less effective. Even going sleep time, alcohol
definitely will alcohol REM, sleep suppressant even suppresses
stage. Two transition REM sleep spindles sleep
spindles. didn't talk function yet, really important moving
memories cortex. It’s unique time hippocampus, sort like ram
brains, writes hard disk cortex it’s unique time


connected. don't want miss don't want miss REM sleep
also part consolidation process schema changing process alcohol
there. know go sleep, metabolized alcohol
put bodies, will affect sleep badly, probably fair say no ingestion
alcohol within four six hours preceding sleep, given half-life all,
better, know people refuse go way maybe little bit okay.
don't know dose response is, um studies there. can look
great yeah, still first stage sleep apologize slowing us down.
sounds like it’s

00:24:55 Middle Sleep States & REM, Schema, Waking Night

Incredibly important first phase sleep. second third 90 minute blocks
sleep? anything makes um unique? signature uh besides
fact come second third night, REM sleep?
later night get um also change hormones. know growth
hormone melatonin levels starting decline, hormones picking up.
really different stage also don't want shortchange think
that’s stage. Many studies showing times sleep
creativity can happen. That’s dreams can incorporate put together old new
things together new way um schema built time. um
yeah. can change minds best phases sleep. elaborate
little bit schema? No one, don't think anyone podcast ever discussed.
Schema little bit familiar schema courses psychology, it’s
while. maybe just refresh mind everyone. Well, it’s it’s still concept
right, think schema um like schema Christmas right.
kinds ideas sew together call Christmas holiday season northern
hemisphere. It’s cold. Santa Claus reindeer jingle bells, even things
false, normally associate Christmas presents family gathering
stuff sewn together one thread linking all, can just
give list words um none contain word Christmas
ask people later um, know, give another list words include word
Christmas say: oh yeah. word minds brought
word Christmas, it’s part whole schema. that’s it’s sort
related, lot related Concepts. guess think it, sort like desktop


computer um scare people, it’s just ton folders yeah,
folder names means something clear specific me. Right inside
folders collections things make sense terms batched kind
one way, exactly? No that’s great way think REM sleep
later parts night transition REM, that’s computer
brain opening folders comparing documents. Seeing, anything same?
two documents look much same, little bit difference
can. can link conceptually that’s probably one origins creativity
finding things related, maybe just linked little bit, can find link
strengthen it. it, know, makes schema interesting different, interesting.
Um. Many people, including myself, tend wake up, maybe middle
night use restroom, tried drink less fluid going sleep I've. heard
also um impulse urinate - forgive topic, lot people deal this,
impulse urinate also dictated quickly drink fluid, not just total volume.
switched sipping fluids slowly. last beverage day, seems
help, point think lot people wake middle
night oftentimes use restroom oftentimes just around 3 A.M might
minutes, hopefully not phone viewing Bright Light, can cause
wakefulness go back sleep. known detriment middle
night waking consider normal feature people's sleep architecture?
think shouldn't worry it. Actually, think know sleep really incredibly well
homeostatically regulated really don't worry much sleeping long
you're, not intentionally depriving sleep something really rewarding
exciting, even stressful body deprives lot things
talking about, don't worry it, um, it’s absolutely normal wake up, least
middle night go bathroom long can get back
sleep reasonable amount Time, um, know, even takes hour, don't
worry long lifestyle allows make sleep
either next morning next night going bed little earlier. understand
correctly, little bit asymmetry sleep catching first phase sleep, it’s
like either get don't, get going sleep essentially
time night, maybe plus minus 15 minutes yeah, then, wake
middle night go back sleep, cannot catch up, can gather sleep
gotten had. just slept whole way night. right, yeah,
yeah, okay, yeah and, don't know actually answer whether not sleep
middle early sleep late sleep fact different another reason,


whether depriving sleep say one 2 30 morning bad
different way. don't know well, suppose experiment case,
tend wake per night sort come recognize part normal
sleep architecture, don't obsess it. notice go back sleep
especially toward mourning sleep

00:30:33 Deep Sleep, Dreams & Senses

incredibly deep, dreams incredibly Vivid. don't always remember them,
unique, perhaps architecture dreams sleep say last third
night second half night right yeah. second half night,
longer REM, sleep periods considered deepest sleep. Even though
slow wave sleep, big, slow wave considered deep. deep yeah, call slow, wave
sleep, deep sleep REM sleep rapid mean, now telling REM sleep
actually deeper sleep. Okay, needs new nomenclature, sleep, researchers!
No, no, please. reason cause slow wave sleep deep sleep it’s
difficult arouse people state arouse state,
often confused just want go back sleep can go back pretty
Easily, arouse someone REM, sleep likely report something
really kind almost like wakefulness. vivid, fact, give someone
none threatening kind stimulation, like somebody dropping keys ping,
something like that, instead waking volume will wake someone non-
rim sleep, REM, sleeping instead lengthen amount time make even
dense rapid eye movements dense often people will incorporate
sound dreams. body brain somehow conscious um
sound, heard also smells can even make dreams REM sleep,
doesn't arouse us. doesn't arouse us often yeah interesting, maybe one
reasons REM sleep deeper especially adults older people deep slow
wave sleep goes away. it’s not deep. It’s not big slow waves aren't large,
probably problematic, not sure, REM sleep. becomes
deepest stage actually children, it’s kind toss-up it’s really hard wake
up. deep, slow wave sleep fact fire alarms, don't wake even
really loud fire alarms state sleep. that’s trying change fire
alarms that, instead something kids don't associate anything like whatever
don't associate says name something else may less loud


Salient will wake up. don't know carried sleeping children
car. don't know want children start waking sleep, that’s
one best things get home kids asleep back seat. can
literally throw shoulder gently course, yes put sleep in,
completely

elaborate dreams. paralyzed REM, sleep, correct! Yes, normally it’s
paralyzed that’s really good, that’s time actively dreaming
storyline dreams hurt - actually really cut off outside
world. terms know, responding say table window door,
different sleepwalking, slow wave sleep slowly sleep.
sleepwalking mixture sleep wakefulness, actually will respond


door. can cook full meal, drive car, deep slowly sleep, it’s scary,
never know going do. don't voluntary voluntary control
it. no conscious control it, can actually safely navigate
situations sleepwalking actually conversation, although may not make much
sense sleep talking REM, sleep you're, not processing outside world
instead, acting Dreams, things like walking
plate, glass window falling off know stairs things like that. really
want muscles inactivated REM, sleep. Otherwise, will act
dreams really hurt bed partner. sleep talking talking
sleep um? don't know many relationships um saved sleep talking,
guessing destroyed guessing um talking sleep
meaning perhaps no meaning just dreams meaning no
meaning, recall yeah not take sleep talking seriously, no matter people
say, doesn't necessarily reflect truth, it’s not like truthful
sleep talking, just saved number relationships. Um, not directing anyone
particular, guarantee just

00:36:47 Alarm Clock & Grogginess; Sleep Trackers, Brain & Sleep

um noted um people start approach mourning time normally
wake up, heard it’s important to, possible, complete one 90-minute
Cycles prior waking up. is, set alarm halfway one 90
minute cycles come late night sleep, can lead um rather groggy
patterns waking um. just ask directly: use alarm clock? not um,
thankfully line work doesn't require normally anything
particular time. unless catch plane, always set
alarm just case well. fellow academic, can tell you. plenty punishing
features academic scientist um offset fact don't
use alarm clock, nice can often set schedule.
recommend that, possible, people not use alarm clock yeah? Absolutely can
just listen body wake need wake up? great um
um. One reasons grogginess called Sleep inertia
wake wrong state, um deep, slow wave. Sleep liken
uh like washing machine cycle. 90-minute Cycles, like washing machine cycle
um first part, add water right clothes soaking wet. don't


want open washing machine try function put wear around,
soaking, wet full soap. wait cycle
can well. Actually, put dryer too, want wear
yeah can function. just takes little clothes brain dry out,
can actually function well, um, it’s better wait whole cycle. complete
that’s want set 90 90 minute alarm clock that’s around 90
minutes, first stage sleep, first cycle sleep, actually little longer
like 105 110 minutes, second ones Third ones get sort shorter
shorter, night goes last Cycles, just N2 REM
sleep cycle, takes less time, wake REM, sleep usually no
problem. Cognitively good go. fan sleep, trackers, uh sure, yeah
yeah? use one one on? don't take. don't. don't live life
best ones. Right now 70 effective staging sleep,
70, it’s okay, it’s okay, um. Take grain salt saying. Yeah tried
various ones, compare mattress based one a. actually wear ankle
instead wrist um find informative, um, colleague mine
Stanford Ali Crum, works mindset belief, effects. Um talk study
people often will buy us sense daytime wakefulness based
sleep score subjective score. words, told got poor
night's sleep, even got great night's sleep - course
measured sleep lab. able compare people report feeling
groggy opposite also true says 100 90 sleep score, people
go, feel great, even though might not slept well. speaks the. don't
want say placebo effect, sort belief effects woven score yeah
um. seems combining subjective objective data probably better,
believe trust physiology way body
telling feel, fact, used people insomnia weren't often
not believed put sleep lab look like slept great
wake morning say. Oh, didn't sleep well all, that’s
probably just came paper shows subcortical structures can
completely different sleep State cortical structures, measure
sleep lab. cortex might people say not sleep night
long, even though cortex saying. Oh no, great sleep
monitoring subcortical hypothalamus hippocampus Thalamus
structures sleep lab. Just can't access, unless depth electrodes,
nobody really wants right, requires holes skulls wires yeah wow. So,


mean last 50 plus years sleep science um it’s potentially flawed
way, recording guess be. analogy it’s
like recording surface ocean opposed depth ocean right
trying ascertain life moving deep there, brace uh colleagues
Stanford, sleep lab elsewhere uh. please just tell us, think scientists want
know truth, yeah yeah, nothing want know cortex doing.
mean cortex really important lot things, doesn't necessarily tell
lot really important parts brain terms sleep um,
hope fact great. think that’s possible paper.
look it, it’s pnas year detect subtle changes cortical EEG.
might able tell subcortical structures doing. Things like absolute
power sleep, spindle band, Sigma band change hippocampus
REM, sleep cortex sleep, spindle, State vice versa.
hope can gain people depth, electrodes animals depth
electrodes backwards machine, learn cortex might able tell us
subcritical structures cortical EEG interesting. going stimuli.
Yeah stay tuned. It’s going stimulus development new

00:43:19 Early Slow Wave Sleep & “Washout”, Normal Sleep Cycle & Night Owls

Technology always going assist scientific discovery, um one thing.
wanted ask architecture night's sleep um terms early part
night. Earlier mentioned washout debris um so-called lymphatic system.
think referring to. tell us little bit washout
occurs brain sleep? roles it’s thought serve
perhaps ways ensure happens ensure doesn't happen,
obviously want happen. Yeah yeah um right great question. talked
circadian clock certain things happen certain times. Well, one
things happens awake talking lot
plasticity, something learning today learning
changes synapses changes way proteins going folded
changed sleep, unfolds, process actually uses lot ATP power
um structure, fuel brain unfolds also proteins,
using them, that, first part night. first fall asleep
first 20 minutes building adenosine back ATP, that’s probably


power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced

yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward

makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti

take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

00:14:50 Sleep Cycles, Sleep Spindles, “Falling” Asleep, Dreams & Memories

shout acupuncturists uh Eastern medicine um, return
idea architecture perfect night's sleep. said um, fall asleep.
first 90 minutes sleep REM, sleep, rapid eye movement. Sleep will arrive 95
minutes in. mean rest 90 minutes consumed slow wave
sleep, yeah, non-rem, sleep, okay, Sleep lightly asleep?
might dream us somehow thinking movement jolt
away, often happens early night. Yeah yeah. That’s first
stage stage, one stage two sleep stage: two sleep really cool,
something called sleep, spindles K complexes sleep spindles little bit
activity. That’s 10 15 Hertz frequency. It’s conversation thalamus
cortex, thalamus gateway Consciousness neocortex. know,
processes cognition um. it’s it’s. spindles called sleep spindles
wake state, will often report dream like hallucination style
dream. won't long dream report like you, REM sleep, will
hallucination state enduring. falling asleep one reasons call falling
asleep stage one stage two muscles relaxing part
brain, that’s conscious enough sort recognize relaxation will feel like
falling will jerk Awake often hallucination, it’s called hypnagotic hallucination will
feel like it'll include falling aspect will wake that’s really interesting me.
long felt sensation almost like dropping back head um, much
elevate feet just slightly tilt head back just slightly order go sleep, find
fall asleep much faster interesting, feel going fall, like almost gon
na, backward somersault. actually really like sensation usually
proceeds falling deeply yeah. That’s really interesting. somebody study
elevated feet yeah. little bit um body position sleep
washout talk early night um. got lighter stages sleep,
less rapid eye movement, sleep. can say dreams occur
say? First second um, know 90 minute cycles sleep. quite different
patterns sleep dreaming occur later night toward morning? Well,
okay, that’s interesting question. lot facets it. evidence
first four hours sleep important memory processing fact,
learned something new day experienced new sensory motor experience,
early sleep dreams will incorporate experience. Much later sleep
dreams later, memory gets Consolidated early structures,


hippocampus deep temporal lobe cortex distributed fashion. memory
seems move hippocampus cortex also dreams incorporate
memory also move later night. nobody knows why, does.
great study siddarta Ribeiro studied consolidation memories cortex
hippocampus cortex rat across period full day. Sleep
rats sleep daytime found subsequent Rim sleep period, moved
memory, hippocampus first first area, projects second
area. third area. can see memory moving

00:19:01 Tool: Growth Hormone Release & Sleep

Um throughout Sleep cool period, yeah cool, read
study. um number different hormones associated different stages
sleep. know melatonin hormone nighttime nighttime. makes sleepy
um growth hormone release occur sleep, growth
hormone release happens day, long night long, Deep, slow way sleep
get. first sleep cycle get big bolus growth, hormone release
men women equally, miss first deep, slow way sleep period,
also miss big bolus growth hormone release might get ultimately across
day, just much overall growth hormone release, endocrinologists will tell big
boluses different things little bit eeked time. well. know,
also big push synthesize proteins. that’s protein synthesis part
builds memories, example brain, happens first cycle sleep. don't
want miss that, especially learned something really big needs needs
synaptic space encode it. somebody miss first 90 minutes driving
yeah? say normally go sleep 10 pm 10 11 30
first phase sleep that’s growth hormone, big bolus growth
hormone released. mean go sleep instead 11, 30
midnight miss first phase sleep, not case get first phase
sleep just simply starting later? beautiful clock body. knows
things happen, it’s every cell body clock clocks
normally synchronized Circadian clocks synchronized, cells
ready respond onto growth hormone release particular time, Miss
it’s time relation melatonin also miss yeah might get growth
hormone release, it’s occurring time clock already moved


next phase, it’s it’s just clock thing. Yeah, don't think can overstate
importance just described honest, despite knowing bit
Sleep, research circadian biology. first time ever heard
normally go sleep particular time growth hormone released first
phase sleep can't simply initiate sleep bout later expect capture
first phase sleep yeah, that’s incredible think important um, many listeners
probably realizing, also highly actionable. means
fairly consistent bedtimes addition fairly consistent, wait times. right exactly
fact one

00:22:05 Adolescence; Early Sleep, Alcohol & Sleep Spindles

Best markers good neurological health get older, consistent, bedtimes, wow,
okay, um. don't want backtrack, write something think important
resolve resolve. going ask um people sleep, nine
hours perhaps reflecting issue. underlying issue, perhaps
teenager adolescent undergoing stage development lot
bodily brain growth. exception that, because, yes, don't recall sleeping ton
teenager, ton energy, know teenagers sleep lot yeah
like they'll, just sleep sleep sleep sleep: let Sleep sleep
sleep okay, can sleep okay, that’s one exception. just like babies?
Okay, developing something brain rest body. really
need sleep help. Organize mean sleep really hard work organizing
brains making develop right, deprive sleep will actually
also just like, like. said daily clock. also developmental clock
can miss developmental window don't let sleep extra like need
things inhibit: growth, hormone release components first stage sleep.
words, go sleep religiously, every night 10 pm things perhaps
preceding hours preceding day like ingest, caffeine alcohol, can make
first stage sleep less effective. Even going sleep time, alcohol
definitely will alcohol REM, sleep suppressant even suppresses
stage. Two transition REM sleep spindles sleep
spindles. didn't talk function yet, really important moving
memories cortex. It’s unique time hippocampus, sort like ram
brains, writes hard disk cortex it’s unique time


connected. don't want miss don't want miss REM sleep
also part consolidation process schema changing process alcohol
there. know go sleep, metabolized alcohol
put bodies, will affect sleep badly, probably fair say no ingestion
alcohol within four six hours preceding sleep, given half-life all,
better, know people refuse go way maybe little bit okay.
don't know dose response is, um studies there. can look
great yeah, still first stage sleep apologize slowing us down.
sounds like it’s

00:24:55 Middle Sleep States & REM, Schema, Waking Night

Incredibly important first phase sleep. second third 90 minute blocks
sleep? anything makes um unique? signature uh besides
fact come second third night, REM sleep?
later night get um also change hormones. know growth
hormone melatonin levels starting decline, hormones picking up.
really different stage also don't want shortchange think
that’s stage. Many studies showing times sleep
creativity can happen. That’s dreams can incorporate put together old new
things together new way um schema built time. um
yeah. can change minds best phases sleep. elaborate
little bit schema? No one, don't think anyone podcast ever discussed.
Schema little bit familiar schema courses psychology, it’s
while. maybe just refresh mind everyone. Well, it’s it’s still concept
right, think schema um like schema Christmas right.
kinds ideas sew together call Christmas holiday season northern
hemisphere. It’s cold. Santa Claus reindeer jingle bells, even things
false, normally associate Christmas presents family gathering
stuff sewn together one thread linking all, can just
give list words um none contain word Christmas
ask people later um, know, give another list words include word
Christmas say: oh yeah. word minds brought
word Christmas, it’s part whole schema. that’s it’s sort
related, lot related Concepts. guess think it, sort like desktop


computer um scare people, it’s just ton folders yeah,
folder names means something clear specific me. Right inside
folders collections things make sense terms batched kind
one way, exactly? No that’s great way think REM sleep
later parts night transition REM, that’s computer
brain opening folders comparing documents. Seeing, anything same?
two documents look much same, little bit difference
can. can link conceptually that’s probably one origins creativity
finding things related, maybe just linked little bit, can find link
strengthen it. it, know, makes schema interesting different, interesting.
Um. Many people, including myself, tend wake up, maybe middle
night use restroom, tried drink less fluid going sleep I've. heard
also um impulse urinate - forgive topic, lot people deal this,
impulse urinate also dictated quickly drink fluid, not just total volume.
switched sipping fluids slowly. last beverage day, seems
help, point think lot people wake middle
night oftentimes use restroom oftentimes just around 3 A.M might
minutes, hopefully not phone viewing Bright Light, can cause
wakefulness go back sleep. known detriment middle
night waking consider normal feature people's sleep architecture?
think shouldn't worry it. Actually, think know sleep really incredibly well
homeostatically regulated really don't worry much sleeping long
you're, not intentionally depriving sleep something really rewarding
exciting, even stressful body deprives lot things
talking about, don't worry it, um, it’s absolutely normal wake up, least
middle night go bathroom long can get back
sleep reasonable amount Time, um, know, even takes hour, don't
worry long lifestyle allows make sleep
either next morning next night going bed little earlier. understand
correctly, little bit asymmetry sleep catching first phase sleep, it’s
like either get don't, get going sleep essentially
time night, maybe plus minus 15 minutes yeah, then, wake
middle night go back sleep, cannot catch up, can gather sleep
gotten had. just slept whole way night. right, yeah,
yeah, okay, yeah and, don't know actually answer whether not sleep
middle early sleep late sleep fact different another reason,


whether depriving sleep say one 2 30 morning bad
different way. don't know well, suppose experiment case,
tend wake per night sort come recognize part normal
sleep architecture, don't obsess it. notice go back sleep
especially toward mourning sleep

00:30:33 Deep Sleep, Dreams & Senses

incredibly deep, dreams incredibly Vivid. don't always remember them,
unique, perhaps architecture dreams sleep say last third
night second half night right yeah. second half night,
longer REM, sleep periods considered deepest sleep. Even though
slow wave sleep, big, slow wave considered deep. deep yeah, call slow, wave
sleep, deep sleep REM sleep rapid mean, now telling REM sleep
actually deeper sleep. Okay, needs new nomenclature, sleep, researchers!
No, no, please. reason cause slow wave sleep deep sleep it’s
difficult arouse people state arouse state,
often confused just want go back sleep can go back pretty
Easily, arouse someone REM, sleep likely report something
really kind almost like wakefulness. vivid, fact, give someone
none threatening kind stimulation, like somebody dropping keys ping,
something like that, instead waking volume will wake someone non-
rim sleep, REM, sleeping instead lengthen amount time make even
dense rapid eye movements dense often people will incorporate
sound dreams. body brain somehow conscious um
sound, heard also smells can even make dreams REM sleep,
doesn't arouse us. doesn't arouse us often yeah interesting, maybe one
reasons REM sleep deeper especially adults older people deep slow
wave sleep goes away. it’s not deep. It’s not big slow waves aren't large,
probably problematic, not sure, REM sleep. becomes
deepest stage actually children, it’s kind toss-up it’s really hard wake
up. deep, slow wave sleep fact fire alarms, don't wake even
really loud fire alarms state sleep. that’s trying change fire
alarms that, instead something kids don't associate anything like whatever
don't associate says name something else may less loud


Salient will wake up. don't know carried sleeping children
car. don't know want children start waking sleep, that’s
one best things get home kids asleep back seat. can
literally throw shoulder gently course, yes put sleep in,
completely

elaborate dreams. paralyzed REM, sleep, correct! Yes, normally it’s
paralyzed that’s really good, that’s time actively dreaming
storyline dreams hurt - actually really cut off outside
world. terms know, responding say table window door,
different sleepwalking, slow wave sleep slowly sleep.
sleepwalking mixture sleep wakefulness, actually will respond


door. can cook full meal, drive car, deep slowly sleep, it’s scary,
never know going do. don't voluntary voluntary control
it. no conscious control it, can actually safely navigate
situations sleepwalking actually conversation, although may not make much
sense sleep talking REM, sleep you're, not processing outside world
instead, acting Dreams, things like walking
plate, glass window falling off know stairs things like that. really
want muscles inactivated REM, sleep. Otherwise, will act
dreams really hurt bed partner. sleep talking talking
sleep um? don't know many relationships um saved sleep talking,
guessing destroyed guessing um talking sleep
meaning perhaps no meaning just dreams meaning no
meaning, recall yeah not take sleep talking seriously, no matter people
say, doesn't necessarily reflect truth, it’s not like truthful
sleep talking, just saved number relationships. Um, not directing anyone
particular, guarantee just

00:36:47 Alarm Clock & Grogginess; Sleep Trackers, Brain & Sleep

um noted um people start approach mourning time normally
wake up, heard it’s important to, possible, complete one 90-minute
Cycles prior waking up. is, set alarm halfway one 90
minute cycles come late night sleep, can lead um rather groggy
patterns waking um. just ask directly: use alarm clock? not um,
thankfully line work doesn't require normally anything
particular time. unless catch plane, always set
alarm just case well. fellow academic, can tell you. plenty punishing
features academic scientist um offset fact don't
use alarm clock, nice can often set schedule.
recommend that, possible, people not use alarm clock yeah? Absolutely can
just listen body wake need wake up? great um
um. One reasons grogginess called Sleep inertia
wake wrong state, um deep, slow wave. Sleep liken
uh like washing machine cycle. 90-minute Cycles, like washing machine cycle
um first part, add water right clothes soaking wet. don't


want open washing machine try function put wear around,
soaking, wet full soap. wait cycle
can well. Actually, put dryer too, want wear
yeah can function. just takes little clothes brain dry out,
can actually function well, um, it’s better wait whole cycle. complete
that’s want set 90 90 minute alarm clock that’s around 90
minutes, first stage sleep, first cycle sleep, actually little longer
like 105 110 minutes, second ones Third ones get sort shorter
shorter, night goes last Cycles, just N2 REM
sleep cycle, takes less time, wake REM, sleep usually no
problem. Cognitively good go. fan sleep, trackers, uh sure, yeah
yeah? use one one on? don't take. don't. don't live life
best ones. Right now 70 effective staging sleep,
70, it’s okay, it’s okay, um. Take grain salt saying. Yeah tried
various ones, compare mattress based one a. actually wear ankle
instead wrist um find informative, um, colleague mine
Stanford Ali Crum, works mindset belief, effects. Um talk study
people often will buy us sense daytime wakefulness based
sleep score subjective score. words, told got poor
night's sleep, even got great night's sleep - course
measured sleep lab. able compare people report feeling
groggy opposite also true says 100 90 sleep score, people
go, feel great, even though might not slept well. speaks the. don't
want say placebo effect, sort belief effects woven score yeah
um. seems combining subjective objective data probably better,
believe trust physiology way body
telling feel, fact, used people insomnia weren't often
not believed put sleep lab look like slept great
wake morning say. Oh, didn't sleep well all, that’s
probably just came paper shows subcortical structures can
completely different sleep State cortical structures, measure
sleep lab. cortex might people say not sleep night
long, even though cortex saying. Oh no, great sleep
monitoring subcortical hypothalamus hippocampus Thalamus
structures sleep lab. Just can't access, unless depth electrodes,
nobody really wants right, requires holes skulls wires yeah wow. So,


mean last 50 plus years sleep science um it’s potentially flawed
way, recording guess be. analogy it’s
like recording surface ocean opposed depth ocean right
trying ascertain life moving deep there, brace uh colleagues
Stanford, sleep lab elsewhere uh. please just tell us, think scientists want
know truth, yeah yeah, nothing want know cortex doing.
mean cortex really important lot things, doesn't necessarily tell
lot really important parts brain terms sleep um,
hope fact great. think that’s possible paper.
look it, it’s pnas year detect subtle changes cortical EEG.
might able tell subcortical structures doing. Things like absolute
power sleep, spindle band, Sigma band change hippocampus
REM, sleep cortex sleep, spindle, State vice versa.
hope can gain people depth, electrodes animals depth
electrodes backwards machine, learn cortex might able tell us
subcritical structures cortical EEG interesting. going stimuli.
Yeah stay tuned. It’s going stimulus development new

00:43:19 Early Slow Wave Sleep & “Washout”, Normal Sleep Cycle & Night Owls

Technology always going assist scientific discovery, um one thing.
wanted ask architecture night's sleep um terms early part
night. Earlier mentioned washout debris um so-called lymphatic system.
think referring to. tell us little bit washout
occurs brain sleep? roles it’s thought serve
perhaps ways ensure happens ensure doesn't happen,
obviously want happen. Yeah yeah um right great question. talked
circadian clock certain things happen certain times. Well, one
things happens awake talking lot
plasticity, something learning today learning
changes synapses changes way proteins going folded
changed sleep, unfolds, process actually uses lot ATP power
um structure, fuel brain unfolds also proteins,
using them, that, first part night. first fall asleep
first 20 minutes building adenosine back ATP, that’s probably


power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

Um throughout Sleep cool period, yeah cool, read
study. um number different hormones associated different stages
sleep. know melatonin hormone nighttime nighttime. makes sleepy
um growth hormone release occur sleep, growth
hormone release happens day, long night long, Deep, slow way sleep
get. first sleep cycle get big bolus growth, hormone release
men women equally, miss first deep, slow way sleep period,
also miss big bolus growth hormone release might get ultimately across
day, just much overall growth hormone release, endocrinologists will tell big
boluses different things little bit eeked time. well. know,
also big push synthesize proteins. that’s protein synthesis part
builds memories, example brain, happens first cycle sleep. don't
want miss that, especially learned something really big needs needs
synaptic space encode it. somebody miss first 90 minutes driving
yeah? say normally go sleep 10 pm 10 11 30
first phase sleep that’s growth hormone, big bolus growth
hormone released. mean go sleep instead 11, 30
midnight miss first phase sleep, not case get first phase
sleep just simply starting later? beautiful clock body. knows
things happen, it’s every cell body clock clocks
normally synchronized Circadian clocks synchronized, cells
ready respond onto growth hormone release particular time, Miss
it’s time relation melatonin also miss yeah might get growth
hormone release, it’s occurring time clock already moved


next phase, it’s it’s just clock thing. Yeah, don't think can overstate
importance just described honest, despite knowing bit
Sleep, research circadian biology. first time ever heard
normally go sleep particular time growth hormone released first
phase sleep can't simply initiate sleep bout later expect capture
first phase sleep yeah, that’s incredible think important um, many listeners
probably realizing, also highly actionable. means
fairly consistent bedtimes addition fairly consistent, wait times. right exactly
fact one

00:22:05 Adolescence; Early Sleep, Alcohol & Sleep Spindles

Best markers good neurological health get older, consistent, bedtimes, wow,
okay, um. don't want backtrack, write something think important
resolve resolve. going ask um people sleep, nine
hours perhaps reflecting issue. underlying issue, perhaps
teenager adolescent undergoing stage development lot
bodily brain growth. exception that, because, yes, don't recall sleeping ton
teenager, ton energy, know teenagers sleep lot yeah
like they'll, just sleep sleep sleep sleep: let Sleep sleep
sleep okay, can sleep okay, that’s one exception. just like babies?
Okay, developing something brain rest body. really
need sleep help. Organize mean sleep really hard work organizing
brains making develop right, deprive sleep will actually
also just like, like. said daily clock. also developmental clock
can miss developmental window don't let sleep extra like need
things inhibit: growth, hormone release components first stage sleep.
words, go sleep religiously, every night 10 pm things perhaps
preceding hours preceding day like ingest, caffeine alcohol, can make
first stage sleep less effective. Even going sleep time, alcohol
definitely will alcohol REM, sleep suppressant even suppresses
stage. Two transition REM sleep spindles sleep
spindles. didn't talk function yet, really important moving
memories cortex. It’s unique time hippocampus, sort like ram
brains, writes hard disk cortex it’s unique time


connected. don't want miss don't want miss REM sleep
also part consolidation process schema changing process alcohol
there. know go sleep, metabolized alcohol
put bodies, will affect sleep badly, probably fair say no ingestion
alcohol within four six hours preceding sleep, given half-life all,
better, know people refuse go way maybe little bit okay.
don't know dose response is, um studies there. can look
great yeah, still first stage sleep apologize slowing us down.
sounds like it’s

00:24:55 Middle Sleep States & REM, Schema, Waking Night

Incredibly important first phase sleep. second third 90 minute blocks
sleep? anything makes um unique? signature uh besides
fact come second third night, REM sleep?
later night get um also change hormones. know growth
hormone melatonin levels starting decline, hormones picking up.
really different stage also don't want shortchange think
that’s stage. Many studies showing times sleep
creativity can happen. That’s dreams can incorporate put together old new
things together new way um schema built time. um
yeah. can change minds best phases sleep. elaborate
little bit schema? No one, don't think anyone podcast ever discussed.
Schema little bit familiar schema courses psychology, it’s
while. maybe just refresh mind everyone. Well, it’s it’s still concept
right, think schema um like schema Christmas right.
kinds ideas sew together call Christmas holiday season northern
hemisphere. It’s cold. Santa Claus reindeer jingle bells, even things
false, normally associate Christmas presents family gathering
stuff sewn together one thread linking all, can just
give list words um none contain word Christmas
ask people later um, know, give another list words include word
Christmas say: oh yeah. word minds brought
word Christmas, it’s part whole schema. that’s it’s sort
related, lot related Concepts. guess think it, sort like desktop


computer um scare people, it’s just ton folders yeah,
folder names means something clear specific me. Right inside
folders collections things make sense terms batched kind
one way, exactly? No that’s great way think REM sleep
later parts night transition REM, that’s computer
brain opening folders comparing documents. Seeing, anything same?
two documents look much same, little bit difference
can. can link conceptually that’s probably one origins creativity
finding things related, maybe just linked little bit, can find link
strengthen it. it, know, makes schema interesting different, interesting.
Um. Many people, including myself, tend wake up, maybe middle
night use restroom, tried drink less fluid going sleep I've. heard
also um impulse urinate - forgive topic, lot people deal this,
impulse urinate also dictated quickly drink fluid, not just total volume.
switched sipping fluids slowly. last beverage day, seems
help, point think lot people wake middle
night oftentimes use restroom oftentimes just around 3 A.M might
minutes, hopefully not phone viewing Bright Light, can cause
wakefulness go back sleep. known detriment middle
night waking consider normal feature people's sleep architecture?
think shouldn't worry it. Actually, think know sleep really incredibly well
homeostatically regulated really don't worry much sleeping long
you're, not intentionally depriving sleep something really rewarding
exciting, even stressful body deprives lot things
talking about, don't worry it, um, it’s absolutely normal wake up, least
middle night go bathroom long can get back
sleep reasonable amount Time, um, know, even takes hour, don't
worry long lifestyle allows make sleep
either next morning next night going bed little earlier. understand
correctly, little bit asymmetry sleep catching first phase sleep, it’s
like either get don't, get going sleep essentially
time night, maybe plus minus 15 minutes yeah, then, wake
middle night go back sleep, cannot catch up, can gather sleep
gotten had. just slept whole way night. right, yeah,
yeah, okay, yeah and, don't know actually answer whether not sleep
middle early sleep late sleep fact different another reason,


whether depriving sleep say one 2 30 morning bad
different way. don't know well, suppose experiment case,
tend wake per night sort come recognize part normal
sleep architecture, don't obsess it. notice go back sleep
especially toward mourning sleep

00:30:33 Deep Sleep, Dreams & Senses

incredibly deep, dreams incredibly Vivid. don't always remember them,
unique, perhaps architecture dreams sleep say last third
night second half night right yeah. second half night,
longer REM, sleep periods considered deepest sleep. Even though
slow wave sleep, big, slow wave considered deep. deep yeah, call slow, wave
sleep, deep sleep REM sleep rapid mean, now telling REM sleep
actually deeper sleep. Okay, needs new nomenclature, sleep, researchers!
No, no, please. reason cause slow wave sleep deep sleep it’s
difficult arouse people state arouse state,
often confused just want go back sleep can go back pretty
Easily, arouse someone REM, sleep likely report something
really kind almost like wakefulness. vivid, fact, give someone
none threatening kind stimulation, like somebody dropping keys ping,
something like that, instead waking volume will wake someone non-
rim sleep, REM, sleeping instead lengthen amount time make even
dense rapid eye movements dense often people will incorporate
sound dreams. body brain somehow conscious um
sound, heard also smells can even make dreams REM sleep,
doesn't arouse us. doesn't arouse us often yeah interesting, maybe one
reasons REM sleep deeper especially adults older people deep slow
wave sleep goes away. it’s not deep. It’s not big slow waves aren't large,
probably problematic, not sure, REM sleep. becomes
deepest stage actually children, it’s kind toss-up it’s really hard wake
up. deep, slow wave sleep fact fire alarms, don't wake even
really loud fire alarms state sleep. that’s trying change fire
alarms that, instead something kids don't associate anything like whatever
don't associate says name something else may less loud


Salient will wake up. don't know carried sleeping children
car. don't know want children start waking sleep, that’s
one best things get home kids asleep back seat. can
literally throw shoulder gently course, yes put sleep in,
completely

elaborate dreams. paralyzed REM, sleep, correct! Yes, normally it’s
paralyzed that’s really good, that’s time actively dreaming
storyline dreams hurt - actually really cut off outside
world. terms know, responding say table window door,
different sleepwalking, slow wave sleep slowly sleep.
sleepwalking mixture sleep wakefulness, actually will respond


door. can cook full meal, drive car, deep slowly sleep, it’s scary,
never know going do. don't voluntary voluntary control
it. no conscious control it, can actually safely navigate
situations sleepwalking actually conversation, although may not make much
sense sleep talking REM, sleep you're, not processing outside world
instead, acting Dreams, things like walking
plate, glass window falling off know stairs things like that. really
want muscles inactivated REM, sleep. Otherwise, will act
dreams really hurt bed partner. sleep talking talking
sleep um? don't know many relationships um saved sleep talking,
guessing destroyed guessing um talking sleep
meaning perhaps no meaning just dreams meaning no
meaning, recall yeah not take sleep talking seriously, no matter people
say, doesn't necessarily reflect truth, it’s not like truthful
sleep talking, just saved number relationships. Um, not directing anyone
particular, guarantee just

00:36:47 Alarm Clock & Grogginess; Sleep Trackers, Brain & Sleep

um noted um people start approach mourning time normally
wake up, heard it’s important to, possible, complete one 90-minute
Cycles prior waking up. is, set alarm halfway one 90
minute cycles come late night sleep, can lead um rather groggy
patterns waking um. just ask directly: use alarm clock? not um,
thankfully line work doesn't require normally anything
particular time. unless catch plane, always set
alarm just case well. fellow academic, can tell you. plenty punishing
features academic scientist um offset fact don't
use alarm clock, nice can often set schedule.
recommend that, possible, people not use alarm clock yeah? Absolutely can
just listen body wake need wake up? great um
um. One reasons grogginess called Sleep inertia
wake wrong state, um deep, slow wave. Sleep liken
uh like washing machine cycle. 90-minute Cycles, like washing machine cycle
um first part, add water right clothes soaking wet. don't


want open washing machine try function put wear around,
soaking, wet full soap. wait cycle
can well. Actually, put dryer too, want wear
yeah can function. just takes little clothes brain dry out,
can actually function well, um, it’s better wait whole cycle. complete
that’s want set 90 90 minute alarm clock that’s around 90
minutes, first stage sleep, first cycle sleep, actually little longer
like 105 110 minutes, second ones Third ones get sort shorter
shorter, night goes last Cycles, just N2 REM
sleep cycle, takes less time, wake REM, sleep usually no
problem. Cognitively good go. fan sleep, trackers, uh sure, yeah
yeah? use one one on? don't take. don't. don't live life
best ones. Right now 70 effective staging sleep,
70, it’s okay, it’s okay, um. Take grain salt saying. Yeah tried
various ones, compare mattress based one a. actually wear ankle
instead wrist um find informative, um, colleague mine
Stanford Ali Crum, works mindset belief, effects. Um talk study
people often will buy us sense daytime wakefulness based
sleep score subjective score. words, told got poor
night's sleep, even got great night's sleep - course
measured sleep lab. able compare people report feeling
groggy opposite also true says 100 90 sleep score, people
go, feel great, even though might not slept well. speaks the. don't
want say placebo effect, sort belief effects woven score yeah
um. seems combining subjective objective data probably better,
believe trust physiology way body
telling feel, fact, used people insomnia weren't often
not believed put sleep lab look like slept great
wake morning say. Oh, didn't sleep well all, that’s
probably just came paper shows subcortical structures can
completely different sleep State cortical structures, measure
sleep lab. cortex might people say not sleep night
long, even though cortex saying. Oh no, great sleep
monitoring subcortical hypothalamus hippocampus Thalamus
structures sleep lab. Just can't access, unless depth electrodes,
nobody really wants right, requires holes skulls wires yeah wow. So,


mean last 50 plus years sleep science um it’s potentially flawed
way, recording guess be. analogy it’s
like recording surface ocean opposed depth ocean right
trying ascertain life moving deep there, brace uh colleagues
Stanford, sleep lab elsewhere uh. please just tell us, think scientists want
know truth, yeah yeah, nothing want know cortex doing.
mean cortex really important lot things, doesn't necessarily tell
lot really important parts brain terms sleep um,
hope fact great. think that’s possible paper.
look it, it’s pnas year detect subtle changes cortical EEG.
might able tell subcortical structures doing. Things like absolute
power sleep, spindle band, Sigma band change hippocampus
REM, sleep cortex sleep, spindle, State vice versa.
hope can gain people depth, electrodes animals depth
electrodes backwards machine, learn cortex might able tell us
subcritical structures cortical EEG interesting. going stimuli.
Yeah stay tuned. It’s going stimulus development new

00:43:19 Early Slow Wave Sleep & “Washout”, Normal Sleep Cycle & Night Owls

Technology always going assist scientific discovery, um one thing.
wanted ask architecture night's sleep um terms early part
night. Earlier mentioned washout debris um so-called lymphatic system.
think referring to. tell us little bit washout
occurs brain sleep? roles it’s thought serve
perhaps ways ensure happens ensure doesn't happen,
obviously want happen. Yeah yeah um right great question. talked
circadian clock certain things happen certain times. Well, one
things happens awake talking lot
plasticity, something learning today learning
changes synapses changes way proteins going folded
changed sleep, unfolds, process actually uses lot ATP power
um structure, fuel brain unfolds also proteins,
using them, that, first part night. first fall asleep
first 20 minutes building adenosine back ATP, that’s probably


power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?

fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

next phase, it’s it’s just clock thing. Yeah, don't think can overstate
importance just described honest, despite knowing bit
Sleep, research circadian biology. first time ever heard
normally go sleep particular time growth hormone released first
phase sleep can't simply initiate sleep bout later expect capture
first phase sleep yeah, that’s incredible think important um, many listeners
probably realizing, also highly actionable. means
fairly consistent bedtimes addition fairly consistent, wait times. right exactly
fact one

00:22:05 Adolescence; Early Sleep, Alcohol & Sleep Spindles

Best markers good neurological health get older, consistent, bedtimes, wow,
okay, um. don't want backtrack, write something think important
resolve resolve. going ask um people sleep, nine
hours perhaps reflecting issue. underlying issue, perhaps
teenager adolescent undergoing stage development lot
bodily brain growth. exception that, because, yes, don't recall sleeping ton
teenager, ton energy, know teenagers sleep lot yeah
like they'll, just sleep sleep sleep sleep: let Sleep sleep
sleep okay, can sleep okay, that’s one exception. just like babies?
Okay, developing something brain rest body. really
need sleep help. Organize mean sleep really hard work organizing
brains making develop right, deprive sleep will actually
also just like, like. said daily clock. also developmental clock
can miss developmental window don't let sleep extra like need
things inhibit: growth, hormone release components first stage sleep.
words, go sleep religiously, every night 10 pm things perhaps
preceding hours preceding day like ingest, caffeine alcohol, can make
first stage sleep less effective. Even going sleep time, alcohol
definitely will alcohol REM, sleep suppressant even suppresses
stage. Two transition REM sleep spindles sleep
spindles. didn't talk function yet, really important moving
memories cortex. It’s unique time hippocampus, sort like ram
brains, writes hard disk cortex it’s unique time


connected. don't want miss don't want miss REM sleep
also part consolidation process schema changing process alcohol
there. know go sleep, metabolized alcohol
put bodies, will affect sleep badly, probably fair say no ingestion
alcohol within four six hours preceding sleep, given half-life all,
better, know people refuse go way maybe little bit okay.
don't know dose response is, um studies there. can look
great yeah, still first stage sleep apologize slowing us down.
sounds like it’s

00:24:55 Middle Sleep States & REM, Schema, Waking Night

Incredibly important first phase sleep. second third 90 minute blocks
sleep? anything makes um unique? signature uh besides
fact come second third night, REM sleep?
later night get um also change hormones. know growth
hormone melatonin levels starting decline, hormones picking up.
really different stage also don't want shortchange think
that’s stage. Many studies showing times sleep
creativity can happen. That’s dreams can incorporate put together old new
things together new way um schema built time. um
yeah. can change minds best phases sleep. elaborate
little bit schema? No one, don't think anyone podcast ever discussed.
Schema little bit familiar schema courses psychology, it’s
while. maybe just refresh mind everyone. Well, it’s it’s still concept
right, think schema um like schema Christmas right.
kinds ideas sew together call Christmas holiday season northern
hemisphere. It’s cold. Santa Claus reindeer jingle bells, even things
false, normally associate Christmas presents family gathering
stuff sewn together one thread linking all, can just
give list words um none contain word Christmas
ask people later um, know, give another list words include word
Christmas say: oh yeah. word minds brought
word Christmas, it’s part whole schema. that’s it’s sort
related, lot related Concepts. guess think it, sort like desktop


computer um scare people, it’s just ton folders yeah,
folder names means something clear specific me. Right inside
folders collections things make sense terms batched kind
one way, exactly? No that’s great way think REM sleep
later parts night transition REM, that’s computer
brain opening folders comparing documents. Seeing, anything same?
two documents look much same, little bit difference
can. can link conceptually that’s probably one origins creativity
finding things related, maybe just linked little bit, can find link
strengthen it. it, know, makes schema interesting different, interesting.
Um. Many people, including myself, tend wake up, maybe middle
night use restroom, tried drink less fluid going sleep I've. heard
also um impulse urinate - forgive topic, lot people deal this,
impulse urinate also dictated quickly drink fluid, not just total volume.
switched sipping fluids slowly. last beverage day, seems
help, point think lot people wake middle
night oftentimes use restroom oftentimes just around 3 A.M might
minutes, hopefully not phone viewing Bright Light, can cause
wakefulness go back sleep. known detriment middle
night waking consider normal feature people's sleep architecture?
think shouldn't worry it. Actually, think know sleep really incredibly well
homeostatically regulated really don't worry much sleeping long
you're, not intentionally depriving sleep something really rewarding
exciting, even stressful body deprives lot things
talking about, don't worry it, um, it’s absolutely normal wake up, least
middle night go bathroom long can get back
sleep reasonable amount Time, um, know, even takes hour, don't
worry long lifestyle allows make sleep
either next morning next night going bed little earlier. understand
correctly, little bit asymmetry sleep catching first phase sleep, it’s
like either get don't, get going sleep essentially
time night, maybe plus minus 15 minutes yeah, then, wake
middle night go back sleep, cannot catch up, can gather sleep
gotten had. just slept whole way night. right, yeah,
yeah, okay, yeah and, don't know actually answer whether not sleep
middle early sleep late sleep fact different another reason,


whether depriving sleep say one 2 30 morning bad
different way. don't know well, suppose experiment case,
tend wake per night sort come recognize part normal
sleep architecture, don't obsess it. notice go back sleep
especially toward mourning sleep

00:30:33 Deep Sleep, Dreams & Senses

incredibly deep, dreams incredibly Vivid. don't always remember them,
unique, perhaps architecture dreams sleep say last third
night second half night right yeah. second half night,
longer REM, sleep periods considered deepest sleep. Even though
slow wave sleep, big, slow wave considered deep. deep yeah, call slow, wave
sleep, deep sleep REM sleep rapid mean, now telling REM sleep
actually deeper sleep. Okay, needs new nomenclature, sleep, researchers!
No, no, please. reason cause slow wave sleep deep sleep it’s
difficult arouse people state arouse state,
often confused just want go back sleep can go back pretty
Easily, arouse someone REM, sleep likely report something
really kind almost like wakefulness. vivid, fact, give someone
none threatening kind stimulation, like somebody dropping keys ping,
something like that, instead waking volume will wake someone non-
rim sleep, REM, sleeping instead lengthen amount time make even
dense rapid eye movements dense often people will incorporate
sound dreams. body brain somehow conscious um
sound, heard also smells can even make dreams REM sleep,
doesn't arouse us. doesn't arouse us often yeah interesting, maybe one
reasons REM sleep deeper especially adults older people deep slow
wave sleep goes away. it’s not deep. It’s not big slow waves aren't large,
probably problematic, not sure, REM sleep. becomes
deepest stage actually children, it’s kind toss-up it’s really hard wake
up. deep, slow wave sleep fact fire alarms, don't wake even
really loud fire alarms state sleep. that’s trying change fire
alarms that, instead something kids don't associate anything like whatever
don't associate says name something else may less loud


Salient will wake up. don't know carried sleeping children
car. don't know want children start waking sleep, that’s
one best things get home kids asleep back seat. can
literally throw shoulder gently course, yes put sleep in,
completely

elaborate dreams. paralyzed REM, sleep, correct! Yes, normally it’s
paralyzed that’s really good, that’s time actively dreaming
storyline dreams hurt - actually really cut off outside
world. terms know, responding say table window door,
different sleepwalking, slow wave sleep slowly sleep.
sleepwalking mixture sleep wakefulness, actually will respond


door. can cook full meal, drive car, deep slowly sleep, it’s scary,
never know going do. don't voluntary voluntary control
it. no conscious control it, can actually safely navigate
situations sleepwalking actually conversation, although may not make much
sense sleep talking REM, sleep you're, not processing outside world
instead, acting Dreams, things like walking
plate, glass window falling off know stairs things like that. really
want muscles inactivated REM, sleep. Otherwise, will act
dreams really hurt bed partner. sleep talking talking
sleep um? don't know many relationships um saved sleep talking,
guessing destroyed guessing um talking sleep
meaning perhaps no meaning just dreams meaning no
meaning, recall yeah not take sleep talking seriously, no matter people
say, doesn't necessarily reflect truth, it’s not like truthful
sleep talking, just saved number relationships. Um, not directing anyone
particular, guarantee just

00:36:47 Alarm Clock & Grogginess; Sleep Trackers, Brain & Sleep

um noted um people start approach mourning time normally
wake up, heard it’s important to, possible, complete one 90-minute
Cycles prior waking up. is, set alarm halfway one 90
minute cycles come late night sleep, can lead um rather groggy
patterns waking um. just ask directly: use alarm clock? not um,
thankfully line work doesn't require normally anything
particular time. unless catch plane, always set
alarm just case well. fellow academic, can tell you. plenty punishing
features academic scientist um offset fact don't
use alarm clock, nice can often set schedule.
recommend that, possible, people not use alarm clock yeah? Absolutely can
just listen body wake need wake up? great um
um. One reasons grogginess called Sleep inertia
wake wrong state, um deep, slow wave. Sleep liken
uh like washing machine cycle. 90-minute Cycles, like washing machine cycle
um first part, add water right clothes soaking wet. don't


want open washing machine try function put wear around,
soaking, wet full soap. wait cycle
can well. Actually, put dryer too, want wear
yeah can function. just takes little clothes brain dry out,
can actually function well, um, it’s better wait whole cycle. complete
that’s want set 90 90 minute alarm clock that’s around 90
minutes, first stage sleep, first cycle sleep, actually little longer
like 105 110 minutes, second ones Third ones get sort shorter
shorter, night goes last Cycles, just N2 REM
sleep cycle, takes less time, wake REM, sleep usually no
problem. Cognitively good go. fan sleep, trackers, uh sure, yeah
yeah? use one one on? don't take. don't. don't live life
best ones. Right now 70 effective staging sleep,
70, it’s okay, it’s okay, um. Take grain salt saying. Yeah tried
various ones, compare mattress based one a. actually wear ankle
instead wrist um find informative, um, colleague mine
Stanford Ali Crum, works mindset belief, effects. Um talk study
people often will buy us sense daytime wakefulness based
sleep score subjective score. words, told got poor
night's sleep, even got great night's sleep - course
measured sleep lab. able compare people report feeling
groggy opposite also true says 100 90 sleep score, people
go, feel great, even though might not slept well. speaks the. don't
want say placebo effect, sort belief effects woven score yeah
um. seems combining subjective objective data probably better,
believe trust physiology way body
telling feel, fact, used people insomnia weren't often
not believed put sleep lab look like slept great
wake morning say. Oh, didn't sleep well all, that’s
probably just came paper shows subcortical structures can
completely different sleep State cortical structures, measure
sleep lab. cortex might people say not sleep night
long, even though cortex saying. Oh no, great sleep
monitoring subcortical hypothalamus hippocampus Thalamus
structures sleep lab. Just can't access, unless depth electrodes,
nobody really wants right, requires holes skulls wires yeah wow. So,


mean last 50 plus years sleep science um it’s potentially flawed
way, recording guess be. analogy it’s
like recording surface ocean opposed depth ocean right
trying ascertain life moving deep there, brace uh colleagues
Stanford, sleep lab elsewhere uh. please just tell us, think scientists want
know truth, yeah yeah, nothing want know cortex doing.
mean cortex really important lot things, doesn't necessarily tell
lot really important parts brain terms sleep um,
hope fact great. think that’s possible paper.
look it, it’s pnas year detect subtle changes cortical EEG.
might able tell subcortical structures doing. Things like absolute
power sleep, spindle band, Sigma band change hippocampus
REM, sleep cortex sleep, spindle, State vice versa.
hope can gain people depth, electrodes animals depth
electrodes backwards machine, learn cortex might able tell us
subcritical structures cortical EEG interesting. going stimuli.
Yeah stay tuned. It’s going stimulus development new

00:43:19 Early Slow Wave Sleep & “Washout”, Normal Sleep Cycle & Night Owls

Technology always going assist scientific discovery, um one thing.
wanted ask architecture night's sleep um terms early part
night. Earlier mentioned washout debris um so-called lymphatic system.
think referring to. tell us little bit washout
occurs brain sleep? roles it’s thought serve
perhaps ways ensure happens ensure doesn't happen,
obviously want happen. Yeah yeah um right great question. talked
circadian clock certain things happen certain times. Well, one
things happens awake talking lot
plasticity, something learning today learning
changes synapses changes way proteins going folded
changed sleep, unfolds, process actually uses lot ATP power
um structure, fuel brain unfolds also proteins,
using them, that, first part night. first fall asleep
first 20 minutes building adenosine back ATP, that’s probably


power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades

lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

connected. don't want miss don't want miss REM sleep
also part consolidation process schema changing process alcohol
there. know go sleep, metabolized alcohol
put bodies, will affect sleep badly, probably fair say no ingestion
alcohol within four six hours preceding sleep, given half-life all,
better, know people refuse go way maybe little bit okay.
don't know dose response is, um studies there. can look
great yeah, still first stage sleep apologize slowing us down.
sounds like it’s

00:24:55 Middle Sleep States & REM, Schema, Waking Night

Incredibly important first phase sleep. second third 90 minute blocks
sleep? anything makes um unique? signature uh besides
fact come second third night, REM sleep?
later night get um also change hormones. know growth
hormone melatonin levels starting decline, hormones picking up.
really different stage also don't want shortchange think
that’s stage. Many studies showing times sleep
creativity can happen. That’s dreams can incorporate put together old new
things together new way um schema built time. um
yeah. can change minds best phases sleep. elaborate
little bit schema? No one, don't think anyone podcast ever discussed.
Schema little bit familiar schema courses psychology, it’s
while. maybe just refresh mind everyone. Well, it’s it’s still concept
right, think schema um like schema Christmas right.
kinds ideas sew together call Christmas holiday season northern
hemisphere. It’s cold. Santa Claus reindeer jingle bells, even things
false, normally associate Christmas presents family gathering
stuff sewn together one thread linking all, can just
give list words um none contain word Christmas
ask people later um, know, give another list words include word
Christmas say: oh yeah. word minds brought
word Christmas, it’s part whole schema. that’s it’s sort
related, lot related Concepts. guess think it, sort like desktop


computer um scare people, it’s just ton folders yeah,
folder names means something clear specific me. Right inside
folders collections things make sense terms batched kind
one way, exactly? No that’s great way think REM sleep
later parts night transition REM, that’s computer
brain opening folders comparing documents. Seeing, anything same?
two documents look much same, little bit difference
can. can link conceptually that’s probably one origins creativity
finding things related, maybe just linked little bit, can find link
strengthen it. it, know, makes schema interesting different, interesting.
Um. Many people, including myself, tend wake up, maybe middle
night use restroom, tried drink less fluid going sleep I've. heard
also um impulse urinate - forgive topic, lot people deal this,
impulse urinate also dictated quickly drink fluid, not just total volume.
switched sipping fluids slowly. last beverage day, seems
help, point think lot people wake middle
night oftentimes use restroom oftentimes just around 3 A.M might
minutes, hopefully not phone viewing Bright Light, can cause
wakefulness go back sleep. known detriment middle
night waking consider normal feature people's sleep architecture?
think shouldn't worry it. Actually, think know sleep really incredibly well
homeostatically regulated really don't worry much sleeping long
you're, not intentionally depriving sleep something really rewarding
exciting, even stressful body deprives lot things
talking about, don't worry it, um, it’s absolutely normal wake up, least
middle night go bathroom long can get back
sleep reasonable amount Time, um, know, even takes hour, don't
worry long lifestyle allows make sleep
either next morning next night going bed little earlier. understand
correctly, little bit asymmetry sleep catching first phase sleep, it’s
like either get don't, get going sleep essentially
time night, maybe plus minus 15 minutes yeah, then, wake
middle night go back sleep, cannot catch up, can gather sleep
gotten had. just slept whole way night. right, yeah,
yeah, okay, yeah and, don't know actually answer whether not sleep
middle early sleep late sleep fact different another reason,


whether depriving sleep say one 2 30 morning bad
different way. don't know well, suppose experiment case,
tend wake per night sort come recognize part normal
sleep architecture, don't obsess it. notice go back sleep
especially toward mourning sleep

00:30:33 Deep Sleep, Dreams & Senses

incredibly deep, dreams incredibly Vivid. don't always remember them,
unique, perhaps architecture dreams sleep say last third
night second half night right yeah. second half night,
longer REM, sleep periods considered deepest sleep. Even though
slow wave sleep, big, slow wave considered deep. deep yeah, call slow, wave
sleep, deep sleep REM sleep rapid mean, now telling REM sleep
actually deeper sleep. Okay, needs new nomenclature, sleep, researchers!
No, no, please. reason cause slow wave sleep deep sleep it’s
difficult arouse people state arouse state,
often confused just want go back sleep can go back pretty
Easily, arouse someone REM, sleep likely report something
really kind almost like wakefulness. vivid, fact, give someone
none threatening kind stimulation, like somebody dropping keys ping,
something like that, instead waking volume will wake someone non-
rim sleep, REM, sleeping instead lengthen amount time make even
dense rapid eye movements dense often people will incorporate
sound dreams. body brain somehow conscious um
sound, heard also smells can even make dreams REM sleep,
doesn't arouse us. doesn't arouse us often yeah interesting, maybe one
reasons REM sleep deeper especially adults older people deep slow
wave sleep goes away. it’s not deep. It’s not big slow waves aren't large,
probably problematic, not sure, REM sleep. becomes
deepest stage actually children, it’s kind toss-up it’s really hard wake
up. deep, slow wave sleep fact fire alarms, don't wake even
really loud fire alarms state sleep. that’s trying change fire
alarms that, instead something kids don't associate anything like whatever
don't associate says name something else may less loud


Salient will wake up. don't know carried sleeping children
car. don't know want children start waking sleep, that’s
one best things get home kids asleep back seat. can
literally throw shoulder gently course, yes put sleep in,
completely

volume proportion rapid eye movement sleep second half night relates
elaborate dreams. paralyzed REM, sleep, correct! Yes, normally it’s
paralyzed that’s really good, that’s time actively dreaming
storyline dreams hurt - actually really cut off outside
world. terms know, responding say table window door,
different sleepwalking, slow wave sleep slowly sleep.
sleepwalking mixture sleep wakefulness, actually will respond


door. can cook full meal, drive car, deep slowly sleep, it’s scary,
never know going do. don't voluntary voluntary control
it. no conscious control it, can actually safely navigate
situations sleepwalking actually conversation, although may not make much
sense sleep talking REM, sleep you're, not processing outside world
instead, acting Dreams, things like walking
plate, glass window falling off know stairs things like that. really
want muscles inactivated REM, sleep. Otherwise, will act
dreams really hurt bed partner. sleep talking talking
sleep um? don't know many relationships um saved sleep talking,
guessing destroyed guessing um talking sleep
meaning perhaps no meaning just dreams meaning no
meaning, recall yeah not take sleep talking seriously, no matter people
say, doesn't necessarily reflect truth, it’s not like truthful
sleep talking, just saved number relationships. Um, not directing anyone
particular, guarantee just

00:36:47 Alarm Clock & Grogginess; Sleep Trackers, Brain & Sleep

um noted um people start approach mourning time normally
wake up, heard it’s important to, possible, complete one 90-minute
Cycles prior waking up. is, set alarm halfway one 90
minute cycles come late night sleep, can lead um rather groggy
patterns waking um. just ask directly: use alarm clock? not um,
thankfully line work doesn't require normally anything
particular time. unless catch plane, always set
alarm just case well. fellow academic, can tell you. plenty punishing
features academic scientist um offset fact don't
use alarm clock, nice can often set schedule.
recommend that, possible, people not use alarm clock yeah? Absolutely can
just listen body wake need wake up? great um
um. One reasons grogginess called Sleep inertia
wake wrong state, um deep, slow wave. Sleep liken
uh like washing machine cycle. 90-minute Cycles, like washing machine cycle
um first part, add water right clothes soaking wet. don't


want open washing machine try function put wear around,
soaking, wet full soap. wait cycle
can well. Actually, put dryer too, want wear
yeah can function. just takes little clothes brain dry out,
can actually function well, um, it’s better wait whole cycle. complete
that’s want set 90 90 minute alarm clock that’s around 90
minutes, first stage sleep, first cycle sleep, actually little longer
like 105 110 minutes, second ones Third ones get sort shorter
shorter, night goes last Cycles, just N2 REM
sleep cycle, takes less time, wake REM, sleep usually no
problem. Cognitively good go. fan sleep, trackers, uh sure, yeah
yeah? use one one on? don't take. don't. don't live life
best ones. Right now 70 effective staging sleep,
70, it’s okay, it’s okay, um. Take grain salt saying. Yeah tried
various ones, compare mattress based one a. actually wear ankle
instead wrist um find informative, um, colleague mine
Stanford Ali Crum, works mindset belief, effects. Um talk study
people often will buy us sense daytime wakefulness based
sleep score subjective score. words, told got poor
night's sleep, even got great night's sleep - course
measured sleep lab. able compare people report feeling
groggy opposite also true says 100 90 sleep score, people
go, feel great, even though might not slept well. speaks the. don't
want say placebo effect, sort belief effects woven score yeah
um. seems combining subjective objective data probably better,
believe trust physiology way body
telling feel, fact, used people insomnia weren't often
not believed put sleep lab look like slept great
wake morning say. Oh, didn't sleep well all, that’s
probably just came paper shows subcortical structures can
completely different sleep State cortical structures, measure
sleep lab. cortex might people say not sleep night
long, even though cortex saying. Oh no, great sleep
monitoring subcortical hypothalamus hippocampus Thalamus
structures sleep lab. Just can't access, unless depth electrodes,
nobody really wants right, requires holes skulls wires yeah wow. So,


mean last 50 plus years sleep science um it’s potentially flawed
way, recording guess be. analogy it’s
like recording surface ocean opposed depth ocean right
trying ascertain life moving deep there, brace uh colleagues
Stanford, sleep lab elsewhere uh. please just tell us, think scientists want
know truth, yeah yeah, nothing want know cortex doing.
mean cortex really important lot things, doesn't necessarily tell
lot really important parts brain terms sleep um,
hope fact great. think that’s possible paper.
look it, it’s pnas year detect subtle changes cortical EEG.
might able tell subcortical structures doing. Things like absolute
power sleep, spindle band, Sigma band change hippocampus
REM, sleep cortex sleep, spindle, State vice versa.
hope can gain people depth, electrodes animals depth
electrodes backwards machine, learn cortex might able tell us
subcritical structures cortical EEG interesting. going stimuli.
Yeah stay tuned. It’s going stimulus development new

00:43:19 Early Slow Wave Sleep & “Washout”, Normal Sleep Cycle & Night Owls

Technology always going assist scientific discovery, um one thing.
wanted ask architecture night's sleep um terms early part
night. Earlier mentioned washout debris um so-called lymphatic system.
think referring to. tell us little bit washout
occurs brain sleep? roles it’s thought serve
perhaps ways ensure happens ensure doesn't happen,
obviously want happen. Yeah yeah um right great question. talked
circadian clock certain things happen certain times. Well, one
things happens awake talking lot
plasticity, something learning today learning
changes synapses changes way proteins going folded
changed sleep, unfolds, process actually uses lot ATP power
um structure, fuel brain unfolds also proteins,
using them, that, first part night. first fall asleep
first 20 minutes building adenosine back ATP, that’s probably


power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

computer um scare people, it’s just ton folders yeah,
folder names means something clear specific me. Right inside
folders collections things make sense terms batched kind
one way, exactly? No that’s great way think REM sleep
later parts night transition REM, that’s computer
brain opening folders comparing documents. Seeing, anything same?
two documents look much same, little bit difference
can. can link conceptually that’s probably one origins creativity
finding things related, maybe just linked little bit, can find link
strengthen it. it, know, makes schema interesting different, interesting.
Um. Many people, including myself, tend wake up, maybe middle
night use restroom, tried drink less fluid going sleep I've. heard
also um impulse urinate - forgive topic, lot people deal this,
impulse urinate also dictated quickly drink fluid, not just total volume.
switched sipping fluids slowly. last beverage day, seems
help, point think lot people wake middle
night oftentimes use restroom oftentimes just around 3 A.M might
minutes, hopefully not phone viewing Bright Light, can cause
wakefulness go back sleep. known detriment middle
night waking consider normal feature people's sleep architecture?
think shouldn't worry it. Actually, think know sleep really incredibly well
homeostatically regulated really don't worry much sleeping long
you're, not intentionally depriving sleep something really rewarding
exciting, even stressful body deprives lot things
talking about, don't worry it, um, it’s absolutely normal wake up, least
middle night go bathroom long can get back
sleep reasonable amount Time, um, know, even takes hour, don't
worry long lifestyle allows make sleep
either next morning next night going bed little earlier. understand
correctly, little bit asymmetry sleep catching first phase sleep, it’s
like either get don't, get going sleep essentially
time night, maybe plus minus 15 minutes yeah, then, wake
middle night go back sleep, cannot catch up, can gather sleep
gotten had. just slept whole way night. right, yeah,
yeah, okay, yeah and, don't know actually answer whether not sleep
middle early sleep late sleep fact different another reason,


whether depriving sleep say one 2 30 morning bad
different way. don't know well, suppose experiment case,
tend wake per night sort come recognize part normal
sleep architecture, don't obsess it. notice go back sleep
especially toward mourning sleep

00:30:33 Deep Sleep, Dreams & Senses

incredibly deep, dreams incredibly Vivid. don't always remember them,
unique, perhaps architecture dreams sleep say last third
night second half night right yeah. second half night,
longer REM, sleep periods considered deepest sleep. Even though
slow wave sleep, big, slow wave considered deep. deep yeah, call slow, wave
sleep, deep sleep REM sleep rapid mean, now telling REM sleep
actually deeper sleep. Okay, needs new nomenclature, sleep, researchers!
No, no, please. reason cause slow wave sleep deep sleep it’s
difficult arouse people state arouse state,
often confused just want go back sleep can go back pretty
Easily, arouse someone REM, sleep likely report something
really kind almost like wakefulness. vivid, fact, give someone
none threatening kind stimulation, like somebody dropping keys ping,
something like that, instead waking volume will wake someone non-
rim sleep, REM, sleeping instead lengthen amount time make even
dense rapid eye movements dense often people will incorporate
sound dreams. body brain somehow conscious um
sound, heard also smells can even make dreams REM sleep,
doesn't arouse us. doesn't arouse us often yeah interesting, maybe one
reasons REM sleep deeper especially adults older people deep slow
wave sleep goes away. it’s not deep. It’s not big slow waves aren't large,
probably problematic, not sure, REM sleep. becomes
deepest stage actually children, it’s kind toss-up it’s really hard wake
up. deep, slow wave sleep fact fire alarms, don't wake even
really loud fire alarms state sleep. that’s trying change fire
alarms that, instead something kids don't associate anything like whatever
don't associate says name something else may less loud


Salient will wake up. don't know carried sleeping children
car. don't know want children start waking sleep, that’s
one best things get home kids asleep back seat. can
literally throw shoulder gently course, yes put sleep in,
completely

volume proportion rapid eye movement sleep second half night relates
elaborate dreams. paralyzed REM, sleep, correct! Yes, normally it’s
paralyzed that’s really good, that’s time actively dreaming
storyline dreams hurt - actually really cut off outside
world. terms know, responding say table window door,
different sleepwalking, slow wave sleep slowly sleep.
sleepwalking mixture sleep wakefulness, actually will respond


door. can cook full meal, drive car, deep slowly sleep, it’s scary,
never know going do. don't voluntary voluntary control
it. no conscious control it, can actually safely navigate
situations sleepwalking actually conversation, although may not make much
sense sleep talking REM, sleep you're, not processing outside world
instead, acting Dreams, things like walking
plate, glass window falling off know stairs things like that. really
want muscles inactivated REM, sleep. Otherwise, will act
dreams really hurt bed partner. sleep talking talking
sleep um? don't know many relationships um saved sleep talking,
guessing destroyed guessing um talking sleep
meaning perhaps no meaning just dreams meaning no
meaning, recall yeah not take sleep talking seriously, no matter people
say, doesn't necessarily reflect truth, it’s not like truthful
sleep talking, just saved number relationships. Um, not directing anyone
particular, guarantee just

00:36:47 Alarm Clock & Grogginess; Sleep Trackers, Brain & Sleep

um noted um people start approach mourning time normally
wake up, heard it’s important to, possible, complete one 90-minute
Cycles prior waking up. is, set alarm halfway one 90
minute cycles come late night sleep, can lead um rather groggy
patterns waking um. just ask directly: use alarm clock? not um,
thankfully line work doesn't require normally anything
particular time. unless catch plane, always set
alarm just case well. fellow academic, can tell you. plenty punishing
features academic scientist um offset fact don't
use alarm clock, nice can often set schedule.
recommend that, possible, people not use alarm clock yeah? Absolutely can
just listen body wake need wake up? great um
um. One reasons grogginess called Sleep inertia
wake wrong state, um deep, slow wave. Sleep liken
uh like washing machine cycle. 90-minute Cycles, like washing machine cycle
um first part, add water right clothes soaking wet. don't


want open washing machine try function put wear around,
soaking, wet full soap. wait cycle
can well. Actually, put dryer too, want wear
yeah can function. just takes little clothes brain dry out,
can actually function well, um, it’s better wait whole cycle. complete
that’s want set 90 90 minute alarm clock that’s around 90
minutes, first stage sleep, first cycle sleep, actually little longer
like 105 110 minutes, second ones Third ones get sort shorter
shorter, night goes last Cycles, just N2 REM
sleep cycle, takes less time, wake REM, sleep usually no
problem. Cognitively good go. fan sleep, trackers, uh sure, yeah
yeah? use one one on? don't take. don't. don't live life
best ones. Right now 70 effective staging sleep,
70, it’s okay, it’s okay, um. Take grain salt saying. Yeah tried
various ones, compare mattress based one a. actually wear ankle
instead wrist um find informative, um, colleague mine
Stanford Ali Crum, works mindset belief, effects. Um talk study
people often will buy us sense daytime wakefulness based
sleep score subjective score. words, told got poor
night's sleep, even got great night's sleep - course
measured sleep lab. able compare people report feeling
groggy opposite also true says 100 90 sleep score, people
go, feel great, even though might not slept well. speaks the. don't
want say placebo effect, sort belief effects woven score yeah
um. seems combining subjective objective data probably better,
believe trust physiology way body
telling feel, fact, used people insomnia weren't often
not believed put sleep lab look like slept great
wake morning say. Oh, didn't sleep well all, that’s
probably just came paper shows subcortical structures can
completely different sleep State cortical structures, measure
sleep lab. cortex might people say not sleep night
long, even though cortex saying. Oh no, great sleep
monitoring subcortical hypothalamus hippocampus Thalamus
structures sleep lab. Just can't access, unless depth electrodes,
nobody really wants right, requires holes skulls wires yeah wow. So,


mean last 50 plus years sleep science um it’s potentially flawed
way, recording guess be. analogy it’s
like recording surface ocean opposed depth ocean right
trying ascertain life moving deep there, brace uh colleagues
Stanford, sleep lab elsewhere uh. please just tell us, think scientists want
know truth, yeah yeah, nothing want know cortex doing.
mean cortex really important lot things, doesn't necessarily tell
lot really important parts brain terms sleep um,
hope fact great. think that’s possible paper.
look it, it’s pnas year detect subtle changes cortical EEG.
might able tell subcortical structures doing. Things like absolute
power sleep, spindle band, Sigma band change hippocampus
REM, sleep cortex sleep, spindle, State vice versa.
hope can gain people depth, electrodes animals depth
electrodes backwards machine, learn cortex might able tell us
subcritical structures cortical EEG interesting. going stimuli.
Yeah stay tuned. It’s going stimulus development new

00:43:19 Early Slow Wave Sleep & “Washout”, Normal Sleep Cycle & Night Owls

Technology always going assist scientific discovery, um one thing.
wanted ask architecture night's sleep um terms early part
night. Earlier mentioned washout debris um so-called lymphatic system.
think referring to. tell us little bit washout
occurs brain sleep? roles it’s thought serve
perhaps ways ensure happens ensure doesn't happen,
obviously want happen. Yeah yeah um right great question. talked
circadian clock certain things happen certain times. Well, one
things happens awake talking lot
plasticity, something learning today learning
changes synapses changes way proteins going folded
changed sleep, unfolds, process actually uses lot ATP power
um structure, fuel brain unfolds also proteins,
using them, that, first part night. first fall asleep
first 20 minutes building adenosine back ATP, that’s probably


power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

aware that? Can turn output locus ceruleus phases
sleep matter, things can cause ramping locus cerules
phase sleep? couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes guests
talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

whether depriving sleep say one 2 30 morning bad
different way. don't know well, suppose experiment case,
tend wake per night sort come recognize part normal
sleep architecture, don't obsess it. notice go back sleep
especially toward mourning sleep

00:30:33 Deep Sleep, Dreams & Senses

incredibly deep, dreams incredibly Vivid. don't always remember them,
unique, perhaps architecture dreams sleep say last third
night second half night right yeah. second half night,
longer REM, sleep periods considered deepest sleep. Even though
slow wave sleep, big, slow wave considered deep. deep yeah, call slow, wave
sleep, deep sleep REM sleep rapid mean, now telling REM sleep
actually deeper sleep. Okay, needs new nomenclature, sleep, researchers!
No, no, please. reason cause slow wave sleep deep sleep it’s
difficult arouse people state arouse state,
often confused just want go back sleep can go back pretty
Easily, arouse someone REM, sleep likely report something
really kind almost like wakefulness. vivid, fact, give someone
none threatening kind stimulation, like somebody dropping keys ping,
something like that, instead waking volume will wake someone non-
rim sleep, REM, sleeping instead lengthen amount time make even
dense rapid eye movements dense often people will incorporate
sound dreams. body brain somehow conscious um
sound, heard also smells can even make dreams REM sleep,
doesn't arouse us. doesn't arouse us often yeah interesting, maybe one
reasons REM sleep deeper especially adults older people deep slow
wave sleep goes away. it’s not deep. It’s not big slow waves aren't large,
probably problematic, not sure, REM sleep. becomes
deepest stage actually children, it’s kind toss-up it’s really hard wake
up. deep, slow wave sleep fact fire alarms, don't wake even
really loud fire alarms state sleep. that’s trying change fire
alarms that, instead something kids don't associate anything like whatever
don't associate says name something else may less loud


Salient will wake up. don't know carried sleeping children
car. don't know want children start waking sleep, that’s
one best things get home kids asleep back seat. can
literally throw shoulder gently course, yes put sleep in,
completely

elaborate dreams. paralyzed REM, sleep, correct! Yes, normally it’s
paralyzed that’s really good, that’s time actively dreaming
storyline dreams hurt - actually really cut off outside
world. terms know, responding say table window door,
different sleepwalking, slow wave sleep slowly sleep.
sleepwalking mixture sleep wakefulness, actually will respond


door. can cook full meal, drive car, deep slowly sleep, it’s scary,
never know going do. don't voluntary voluntary control
it. no conscious control it, can actually safely navigate
situations sleepwalking actually conversation, although may not make much
sense sleep talking REM, sleep you're, not processing outside world
instead, acting Dreams, things like walking
plate, glass window falling off know stairs things like that. really
want muscles inactivated REM, sleep. Otherwise, will act
dreams really hurt bed partner. sleep talking talking
sleep um? don't know many relationships um saved sleep talking,
guessing destroyed guessing um talking sleep
meaning perhaps no meaning just dreams meaning no
meaning, recall yeah not take sleep talking seriously, no matter people
say, doesn't necessarily reflect truth, it’s not like truthful
sleep talking, just saved number relationships. Um, not directing anyone
particular, guarantee just

00:36:47 Alarm Clock & Grogginess; Sleep Trackers, Brain & Sleep

um noted um people start approach mourning time normally
wake up, heard it’s important to, possible, complete one 90-minute
Cycles prior waking up. is, set alarm halfway one 90
minute cycles come late night sleep, can lead um rather groggy
patterns waking um. just ask directly: use alarm clock? not um,
thankfully line work doesn't require normally anything
particular time. unless catch plane, always set
alarm just case well. fellow academic, can tell you. plenty punishing
features academic scientist um offset fact don't
use alarm clock, nice can often set schedule.
recommend that, possible, people not use alarm clock yeah? Absolutely can
just listen body wake need wake up? great um
um. One reasons grogginess called Sleep inertia
wake wrong state, um deep, slow wave. Sleep liken
uh like washing machine cycle. 90-minute Cycles, like washing machine cycle
um first part, add water right clothes soaking wet. don't


want open washing machine try function put wear around,
soaking, wet full soap. wait cycle
can well. Actually, put dryer too, want wear
yeah can function. just takes little clothes brain dry out,
can actually function well, um, it’s better wait whole cycle. complete
that’s want set 90 90 minute alarm clock that’s around 90
minutes, first stage sleep, first cycle sleep, actually little longer
like 105 110 minutes, second ones Third ones get sort shorter
shorter, night goes last Cycles, just N2 REM
sleep cycle, takes less time, wake REM, sleep usually no
problem. Cognitively good go. fan sleep, trackers, uh sure, yeah
yeah? use one one on? don't take. don't. don't live life
best ones. Right now 70 effective staging sleep,
70, it’s okay, it’s okay, um. Take grain salt saying. Yeah tried
various ones, compare mattress based one a. actually wear ankle
instead wrist um find informative, um, colleague mine
Stanford Ali Crum, works mindset belief, effects. Um talk study
people often will buy us sense daytime wakefulness based
sleep score subjective score. words, told got poor
night's sleep, even got great night's sleep - course
measured sleep lab. able compare people report feeling
groggy opposite also true says 100 90 sleep score, people
go, feel great, even though might not slept well. speaks the. don't
want say placebo effect, sort belief effects woven score yeah
um. seems combining subjective objective data probably better,
believe trust physiology way body
telling feel, fact, used people insomnia weren't often
not believed put sleep lab look like slept great
wake morning say. Oh, didn't sleep well all, that’s
probably just came paper shows subcortical structures can
completely different sleep State cortical structures, measure
sleep lab. cortex might people say not sleep night
long, even though cortex saying. Oh no, great sleep
monitoring subcortical hypothalamus hippocampus Thalamus
structures sleep lab. Just can't access, unless depth electrodes,
nobody really wants right, requires holes skulls wires yeah wow. So,


mean last 50 plus years sleep science um it’s potentially flawed
way, recording guess be. analogy it’s
like recording surface ocean opposed depth ocean right
trying ascertain life moving deep there, brace uh colleagues
Stanford, sleep lab elsewhere uh. please just tell us, think scientists want
know truth, yeah yeah, nothing want know cortex doing.
mean cortex really important lot things, doesn't necessarily tell
lot really important parts brain terms sleep um,
hope fact great. think that’s possible paper.
look it, it’s pnas year detect subtle changes cortical EEG.
might able tell subcortical structures doing. Things like absolute
power sleep, spindle band, Sigma band change hippocampus
REM, sleep cortex sleep, spindle, State vice versa.
hope can gain people depth, electrodes animals depth
electrodes backwards machine, learn cortex might able tell us
subcritical structures cortical EEG interesting. going stimuli.
Yeah stay tuned. It’s going stimulus development new

00:43:19 Early Slow Wave Sleep & “Washout”, Normal Sleep Cycle & Night Owls

Technology always going assist scientific discovery, um one thing.
wanted ask architecture night's sleep um terms early part
night. Earlier mentioned washout debris um so-called lymphatic system.
think referring to. tell us little bit washout
occurs brain sleep? roles it’s thought serve
perhaps ways ensure happens ensure doesn't happen,
obviously want happen. Yeah yeah um right great question. talked
circadian clock certain things happen certain times. Well, one
things happens awake talking lot
plasticity, something learning today learning
changes synapses changes way proteins going folded
changed sleep, unfolds, process actually uses lot ATP power
um structure, fuel brain unfolds also proteins,
using them, that, first part night. first fall asleep
first 20 minutes building adenosine back ATP, that’s probably


power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

aware that? Can turn output locus ceruleus phases
sleep matter, things can cause ramping locus cerules
phase sleep? couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes guests
talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

volume proportion rapid eye movement sleep second half night relates
elaborate dreams. paralyzed REM, sleep, correct! Yes, normally it’s
paralyzed that’s really good, that’s time actively dreaming
storyline dreams hurt - actually really cut off outside
world. terms know, responding say table window door,
different sleepwalking, slow wave sleep slowly sleep.
sleepwalking mixture sleep wakefulness, actually will respond


door. can cook full meal, drive car, deep slowly sleep, it’s scary,
never know going do. don't voluntary voluntary control
it. no conscious control it, can actually safely navigate
situations sleepwalking actually conversation, although may not make much
sense sleep talking REM, sleep you're, not processing outside world
instead, acting Dreams, things like walking
plate, glass window falling off know stairs things like that. really
want muscles inactivated REM, sleep. Otherwise, will act
dreams really hurt bed partner. sleep talking talking
sleep um? don't know many relationships um saved sleep talking,
guessing destroyed guessing um talking sleep
meaning perhaps no meaning just dreams meaning no
meaning, recall yeah not take sleep talking seriously, no matter people
say, doesn't necessarily reflect truth, it’s not like truthful
sleep talking, just saved number relationships. Um, not directing anyone
particular, guarantee just

00:36:47 Alarm Clock & Grogginess; Sleep Trackers, Brain & Sleep

um noted um people start approach mourning time normally
wake up, heard it’s important to, possible, complete one 90-minute
Cycles prior waking up. is, set alarm halfway one 90
minute cycles come late night sleep, can lead um rather groggy
patterns waking um. just ask directly: use alarm clock? not um,
thankfully line work doesn't require normally anything
particular time. unless catch plane, always set
alarm just case well. fellow academic, can tell you. plenty punishing
features academic scientist um offset fact don't
use alarm clock, nice can often set schedule.
recommend that, possible, people not use alarm clock yeah? Absolutely can
just listen body wake need wake up? great um
um. One reasons grogginess called Sleep inertia
wake wrong state, um deep, slow wave. Sleep liken
uh like washing machine cycle. 90-minute Cycles, like washing machine cycle
um first part, add water right clothes soaking wet. don't


want open washing machine try function put wear around,
soaking, wet full soap. wait cycle
can well. Actually, put dryer too, want wear
yeah can function. just takes little clothes brain dry out,
can actually function well, um, it’s better wait whole cycle. complete
that’s want set 90 90 minute alarm clock that’s around 90
minutes, first stage sleep, first cycle sleep, actually little longer
like 105 110 minutes, second ones Third ones get sort shorter
shorter, night goes last Cycles, just N2 REM
sleep cycle, takes less time, wake REM, sleep usually no
problem. Cognitively good go. fan sleep, trackers, uh sure, yeah
yeah? use one one on? don't take. don't. don't live life
best ones. Right now 70 effective staging sleep,
70, it’s okay, it’s okay, um. Take grain salt saying. Yeah tried
various ones, compare mattress based one a. actually wear ankle
instead wrist um find informative, um, colleague mine
Stanford Ali Crum, works mindset belief, effects. Um talk study
people often will buy us sense daytime wakefulness based
sleep score subjective score. words, told got poor
night's sleep, even got great night's sleep - course
measured sleep lab. able compare people report feeling
groggy opposite also true says 100 90 sleep score, people
go, feel great, even though might not slept well. speaks the. don't
want say placebo effect, sort belief effects woven score yeah
um. seems combining subjective objective data probably better,
believe trust physiology way body
telling feel, fact, used people insomnia weren't often
not believed put sleep lab look like slept great
wake morning say. Oh, didn't sleep well all, that’s
probably just came paper shows subcortical structures can
completely different sleep State cortical structures, measure
sleep lab. cortex might people say not sleep night
long, even though cortex saying. Oh no, great sleep
monitoring subcortical hypothalamus hippocampus Thalamus
structures sleep lab. Just can't access, unless depth electrodes,
nobody really wants right, requires holes skulls wires yeah wow. So,


mean last 50 plus years sleep science um it’s potentially flawed
way, recording guess be. analogy it’s
like recording surface ocean opposed depth ocean right
trying ascertain life moving deep there, brace uh colleagues
Stanford, sleep lab elsewhere uh. please just tell us, think scientists want
know truth, yeah yeah, nothing want know cortex doing.
mean cortex really important lot things, doesn't necessarily tell
lot really important parts brain terms sleep um,
hope fact great. think that’s possible paper.
look it, it’s pnas year detect subtle changes cortical EEG.
might able tell subcortical structures doing. Things like absolute
power sleep, spindle band, Sigma band change hippocampus
REM, sleep cortex sleep, spindle, State vice versa.
hope can gain people depth, electrodes animals depth
electrodes backwards machine, learn cortex might able tell us
subcritical structures cortical EEG interesting. going stimuli.
Yeah stay tuned. It’s going stimulus development new

00:43:19 Early Slow Wave Sleep & “Washout”, Normal Sleep Cycle & Night Owls

Technology always going assist scientific discovery, um one thing.
wanted ask architecture night's sleep um terms early part
night. Earlier mentioned washout debris um so-called lymphatic system.
think referring to. tell us little bit washout
occurs brain sleep? roles it’s thought serve
perhaps ways ensure happens ensure doesn't happen,
obviously want happen. Yeah yeah um right great question. talked
circadian clock certain things happen certain times. Well, one
things happens awake talking lot
plasticity, something learning today learning
changes synapses changes way proteins going folded
changed sleep, unfolds, process actually uses lot ATP power
um structure, fuel brain unfolds also proteins,
using them, that, first part night. first fall asleep
first 20 minutes building adenosine back ATP, that’s probably


power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

aware that? Can turn output locus ceruleus phases
sleep matter, things can cause ramping locus cerules
phase sleep? couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes guests
talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,

door. can cook full meal, drive car, deep slowly sleep, it’s scary,
never know going do. don't voluntary voluntary control
it. no conscious control it, can actually safely navigate
situations sleepwalking actually conversation, although may not make much
sense sleep talking REM, sleep you're, not processing outside world
instead, acting Dreams, things like walking
plate, glass window falling off know stairs things like that. really
want muscles inactivated REM, sleep. Otherwise, will act
dreams really hurt bed partner. sleep talking talking
sleep um? don't know many relationships um saved sleep talking,
guessing destroyed guessing um talking sleep
meaning perhaps no meaning just dreams meaning no
meaning, recall yeah not take sleep talking seriously, no matter people
say, doesn't necessarily reflect truth, it’s not like truthful
sleep talking, just saved number relationships. Um, not directing anyone
particular, guarantee just

00:36:47 Alarm Clock & Grogginess; Sleep Trackers, Brain & Sleep

um noted um people start approach mourning time normally
wake up, heard it’s important to, possible, complete one 90-minute
Cycles prior waking up. is, set alarm halfway one 90
minute cycles come late night sleep, can lead um rather groggy
patterns waking um. just ask directly: use alarm clock? not um,
thankfully line work doesn't require normally anything
particular time. unless catch plane, always set
alarm just case well. fellow academic, can tell you. plenty punishing
features academic scientist um offset fact don't
use alarm clock, nice can often set schedule.
recommend that, possible, people not use alarm clock yeah? Absolutely can
just listen body wake need wake up? great um
um. One reasons grogginess called Sleep inertia
wake wrong state, um deep, slow wave. Sleep liken
uh like washing machine cycle. 90-minute Cycles, like washing machine cycle
um first part, add water right clothes soaking wet. don't


want open washing machine try function put wear around,
soaking, wet full soap. wait cycle
can well. Actually, put dryer too, want wear
yeah can function. just takes little clothes brain dry out,
can actually function well, um, it’s better wait whole cycle. complete
that’s want set 90 90 minute alarm clock that’s around 90
minutes, first stage sleep, first cycle sleep, actually little longer
like 105 110 minutes, second ones Third ones get sort shorter
shorter, night goes last Cycles, just N2 REM
sleep cycle, takes less time, wake REM, sleep usually no
problem. Cognitively good go. fan sleep, trackers, uh sure, yeah
yeah? use one one on? don't take. don't. don't live life
best ones. Right now 70 effective staging sleep,
70, it’s okay, it’s okay, um. Take grain salt saying. Yeah tried
various ones, compare mattress based one a. actually wear ankle
instead wrist um find informative, um, colleague mine
Stanford Ali Crum, works mindset belief, effects. Um talk study
people often will buy us sense daytime wakefulness based
sleep score subjective score. words, told got poor
night's sleep, even got great night's sleep - course
measured sleep lab. able compare people report feeling
groggy opposite also true says 100 90 sleep score, people
go, feel great, even though might not slept well. speaks the. don't
want say placebo effect, sort belief effects woven score yeah
um. seems combining subjective objective data probably better,
believe trust physiology way body
telling feel, fact, used people insomnia weren't often
not believed put sleep lab look like slept great
wake morning say. Oh, didn't sleep well all, that’s
probably just came paper shows subcortical structures can
completely different sleep State cortical structures, measure
sleep lab. cortex might people say not sleep night
long, even though cortex saying. Oh no, great sleep
monitoring subcortical hypothalamus hippocampus Thalamus
structures sleep lab. Just can't access, unless depth electrodes,
nobody really wants right, requires holes skulls wires yeah wow. So,


mean last 50 plus years sleep science um it’s potentially flawed
way, recording guess be. analogy it’s
like recording surface ocean opposed depth ocean right
trying ascertain life moving deep there, brace uh colleagues
Stanford, sleep lab elsewhere uh. please just tell us, think scientists want
know truth, yeah yeah, nothing want know cortex doing.
mean cortex really important lot things, doesn't necessarily tell
lot really important parts brain terms sleep um,
hope fact great. think that’s possible paper.
look it, it’s pnas year detect subtle changes cortical EEG.
might able tell subcortical structures doing. Things like absolute
power sleep, spindle band, Sigma band change hippocampus
REM, sleep cortex sleep, spindle, State vice versa.
hope can gain people depth, electrodes animals depth
electrodes backwards machine, learn cortex might able tell us
subcritical structures cortical EEG interesting. going stimuli.
Yeah stay tuned. It’s going stimulus development new

00:43:19 Early Slow Wave Sleep & “Washout”, Normal Sleep Cycle & Night Owls

Technology always going assist scientific discovery, um one thing.
wanted ask architecture night's sleep um terms early part
night. Earlier mentioned washout debris um so-called lymphatic system.
think referring to. tell us little bit washout
occurs brain sleep? roles it’s thought serve
perhaps ways ensure happens ensure doesn't happen,
obviously want happen. Yeah yeah um right great question. talked
circadian clock certain things happen certain times. Well, one
things happens awake talking lot
plasticity, something learning today learning
changes synapses changes way proteins going folded
changed sleep, unfolds, process actually uses lot ATP power
um structure, fuel brain unfolds also proteins,
using them, that, first part night. first fall asleep
first 20 minutes building adenosine back ATP, that’s probably


power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

want open washing machine try function put wear around,
soaking, wet full soap. wait cycle
can well. Actually, put dryer too, want wear
yeah can function. just takes little clothes brain dry out,
can actually function well, um, it’s better wait whole cycle. complete
that’s want set 90 90 minute alarm clock that’s around 90
minutes, first stage sleep, first cycle sleep, actually little longer
like 105 110 minutes, second ones Third ones get sort shorter
shorter, night goes last Cycles, just N2 REM
sleep cycle, takes less time, wake REM, sleep usually no
problem. Cognitively good go. fan sleep, trackers, uh sure, yeah
yeah? use one one on? don't take. don't. don't live life
best ones. Right now 70 effective staging sleep,
70, it’s okay, it’s okay, um. Take grain salt saying. Yeah tried
various ones, compare mattress based one a. actually wear ankle
instead wrist um find informative, um, colleague mine
Stanford Ali Crum, works mindset belief, effects. Um talk study
people often will buy us sense daytime wakefulness based
sleep score subjective score. words, told got poor
night's sleep, even got great night's sleep - course
measured sleep lab. able compare people report feeling
groggy opposite also true says 100 90 sleep score, people
go, feel great, even though might not slept well. speaks the. don't
want say placebo effect, sort belief effects woven score yeah
um. seems combining subjective objective data probably better,
believe trust physiology way body
telling feel, fact, used people insomnia weren't often
not believed put sleep lab look like slept great
wake morning say. Oh, didn't sleep well all, that’s
probably just came paper shows subcortical structures can
completely different sleep State cortical structures, measure
sleep lab. cortex might people say not sleep night
long, even though cortex saying. Oh no, great sleep
monitoring subcortical hypothalamus hippocampus Thalamus
structures sleep lab. Just can't access, unless depth electrodes,
nobody really wants right, requires holes skulls wires yeah wow. So,


mean last 50 plus years sleep science um it’s potentially flawed
way, recording guess be. analogy it’s
like recording surface ocean opposed depth ocean right
trying ascertain life moving deep there, brace uh colleagues
Stanford, sleep lab elsewhere uh. please just tell us, think scientists want
know truth, yeah yeah, nothing want know cortex doing.
mean cortex really important lot things, doesn't necessarily tell
lot really important parts brain terms sleep um,
hope fact great. think that’s possible paper.
look it, it’s pnas year detect subtle changes cortical EEG.
might able tell subcortical structures doing. Things like absolute
power sleep, spindle band, Sigma band change hippocampus
REM, sleep cortex sleep, spindle, State vice versa.
hope can gain people depth, electrodes animals depth
electrodes backwards machine, learn cortex might able tell us
subcritical structures cortical EEG interesting. going stimuli.
Yeah stay tuned. It’s going stimulus development new

00:43:19 Early Slow Wave Sleep & “Washout”, Normal Sleep Cycle & Night Owls

Technology always going assist scientific discovery, um one thing.
wanted ask architecture night's sleep um terms early part
night. Earlier mentioned washout debris um so-called lymphatic system.
think referring to. tell us little bit washout
occurs brain sleep? roles it’s thought serve
perhaps ways ensure happens ensure doesn't happen,
obviously want happen. Yeah yeah um right great question. talked
circadian clock certain things happen certain times. Well, one
things happens awake talking lot
plasticity, something learning today learning
changes synapses changes way proteins going folded
changed sleep, unfolds, process actually uses lot ATP power
um structure, fuel brain unfolds also proteins,
using them, that, first part night. first fall asleep
first 20 minutes building adenosine back ATP, that’s probably


power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

aware that? Can turn output locus ceruleus phases
sleep matter, things can cause ramping locus cerules
phase sleep? couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes guests
talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

Dr Gina Poe, sleep relationship mental health, physical health
performance last, certainly, not least, thank interest science. [. Music ]


mean last 50 plus years sleep science um it’s potentially flawed
way, recording guess be. analogy it’s
like recording surface ocean opposed depth ocean right
trying ascertain life moving deep there, brace uh colleagues
Stanford, sleep lab elsewhere uh. please just tell us, think scientists want
know truth, yeah yeah, nothing want know cortex doing.
mean cortex really important lot things, doesn't necessarily tell
lot really important parts brain terms sleep um,
hope fact great. think that’s possible paper.
look it, it’s pnas year detect subtle changes cortical EEG.
might able tell subcortical structures doing. Things like absolute
power sleep, spindle band, Sigma band change hippocampus
REM, sleep cortex sleep, spindle, State vice versa.
hope can gain people depth, electrodes animals depth
electrodes backwards machine, learn cortex might able tell us
subcritical structures cortical EEG interesting. going stimuli.
Yeah stay tuned. It’s going stimulus development new

00:43:19 Early Slow Wave Sleep & “Washout”, Normal Sleep Cycle & Night Owls

Technology always going assist scientific discovery, um one thing.
wanted ask architecture night's sleep um terms early part
night. Earlier mentioned washout debris um so-called lymphatic system.
think referring to. tell us little bit washout
occurs brain sleep? roles it’s thought serve
perhaps ways ensure happens ensure doesn't happen,
obviously want happen. Yeah yeah um right great question. talked
circadian clock certain things happen certain times. Well, one
things happens awake talking lot
plasticity, something learning today learning
changes synapses changes way proteins going folded
changed sleep, unfolds, process actually uses lot ATP power
um structure, fuel brain unfolds also proteins,
using them, that, first part night. first fall asleep
first 20 minutes building adenosine back ATP, that’s probably


power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

sleep matter, things can cause ramping locus cerules
phase sleep? couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes guests
talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also

power naps called Power naps actually rebuilding power
also cleaning Deep slow waves slave sleep Cleaning
misfolded proteins unfolded, proteins things get broken know
need rebuilt asleep use wakefulness. liken
too. know big party wakefulness need partygoers
leave order cleanup, think mechanism - still
something tested - actually slow waves themselves, bad news us.
get older slow waves get smaller uh slowly, sleep goes away um.
happens neuron firing? expands? membrane expands little bit
becomes translucent. That’s know one ways. know neurons
expand fire every action potential membrane expands little bit
sodium brings water cell silent, contract
slow waves. cool thing reason can measure
neurons, time, not them, good portion firing
time Silent time, think that. Contracting expanding
time, it’s kind like bilge pump brain can pump glia,
also really important um terms cleaning debris transferring
needs go um. think actually bilge pump cleaning brain,
interesting. heard glymphatic system lymphatic washout. never
thought mechanical aspects before. always thought reason
now it’s obvious me, something mechanical, now
educated this. thought reason, cerebral spinal fluid just
starts washing through, talking literally expansion contraction
neurons unison pushing fluid cleaning misfolded proteins
debris might occur. Yeah, basis metabolic pathways,
consequence leave brain state um, pristine action
next day. Yeah right, yeah, think again, like party don't
clean party, try hold another one. next day it’s going get
clogged. know it’s people harder time, moving around enjoying themselves,
builds day day, know it’s going cognition.
party goers moving around um becomes card yeah, um builds pump
describe associated big slow waves um deep well slow wave sleep yeah
um. going occur less first third night. right, that’s right
um? things inhibit process things facilitate
process? Yeah yeah connected inhibit; it’s not get um, right uh. Sorry,
it’s trouble um, - similar case growth hormone? Where, go


sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

aware that? Can turn output locus ceruleus phases
sleep matter, things can cause ramping locus cerules
phase sleep? couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes guests
talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

sleep later normally miss washout yeah? It’s not you, don't delay
it. miss, missed washer. That’s right! That’s right! go sleep one
two morning, sleep still going dominated N2 REM. Sleep not
slow wave sleep. need need get first bit sleep caveat,
somebody normally goes sleep one two a.m wakes 10 A.M, that, that’s
normal sleep cycle, yeah um, okay. okay, um,
probably want do. Somebody want sleep study people
normally see, also Melatonin releases later corticosterone rise.
happens normally morning also happens later. everything shifted good, um, okay,
yeah, studies. um come across really argue fact
waking Circa Sunrise, doesn't mean Sunrise within hour two, maybe
three hours sunrise going sleep within four hours sunset um, actually
better Health human beings night night owl
almost like night owl Posse there, especially social media. get upset
say see morning sunlight 10 a.m, kind miss
boat um. get upset think 20 30 percent people,
perhaps um, really feel like function? Better staying late waking late
function much less well waking early going bed early, data
health metrics suggests sorry night owls wrong. Yeah. Sorry
night owl, oh boy, okay! Well then, apologizing directly - not really
early morning person, kind typical wake up. Naturally, around 6 30
somewhere 6 30 7 30 a.m, go sleep somewhere 10 11 p.m.
averages um, notice force get little earlier
go sleep little earlier, mood alertness just overall productivity much
higher variables too. Absolutely right. night owl love
staying late night. know, writing grants writing papers watching movies
whatever is. love it, like like every human Earth, better go
bed earlier wake earlier. one good thing night owls child
will wake up. circadian rhythms strong, will wake even
deprive sleep first half night, will still wake like clockwork
circadian rhythms strong 6am. haven't done.
Anything good kid. haven't moved cycle later line
yours. fact, just sleep, deprived made miss window made
cranky next day made life miserable, go bed soon
kids go bed wake them. That’s way right. child alarm clock
another reason children. Yes, got dog puppy became dog


specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

aware that? Can turn output locus ceruleus phases
sleep matter, things can cause ramping locus cerules
phase sleep? couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes guests
talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep

serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

specifically well many reasons. one reason was: wanted one early
morning. Raj. know 5 30 a.m every morning, ended getting bulldog
literally sleep 16 hours. could, nuclear bomb go off wouldn't wake up.
started learn Bulldogs actually sleep apnea there. It’s far
know, species genetically um they're. Essentially, inbred um
sleep defect, yeah, actually don't encourage people get Bulldogs it’s
kind cruel breed. suffer lot body born anyway um dog
can accomplish this, get get uh breed dog going
wake early, so, words, don't get bulldog Mastiff. Well, know,
interestingly, um, predatory animals like dogs cats, us um, well, dogs, cats
lions us. Wills can sleep. know 16 hours day, ferrets predatory, fight
pet ferret yeah sadly, also used work ferrets, publish number papers,
delightful animals, yeah great, can study development, it’s really cool um,
born alterial, Like brains not well developed,
can see happens development important different
phases development really are. yes, um yeah, maybe not Predator much
Predators think, fact, sleep somewhere prey
Predators um terms amount sleep usually need night.
Predators can sleep 16 hours, um napping day, long crepuscular,
perhaps like prey arm, Dawn dusk, active yeah, Don dusk, active um yeah,
anyway, yes, uh children dogs, actually in. poll done national
sleep Foundation see number one thing is, wakes people night
number two going bathroom number. Three children um, know
children young, lasts years wake
babies um. number one thing is: pets pets needing go out. Um
cats. Wanting curl whatever Pets needs will wake
middle night anything else. Another reason not get nocturnal pet people
get hamsters pretty quickly, realize nocturnal want run
wheel around yeah. got put living room away sleep. vote
fish tank folks, um freshwater fish tank. sorts reasons not get saltwater
tank, freshwater fish tank child um. appreciate vote appreciate
mentioning ferrets way, folks carnivores. not rodents
are. elaborate brain structures they're, smart um family
honey badgers musculates anyway. Well, shouldn't uh geek
much



00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

aware that? Can turn output locus ceruleus phases
sleep matter, things can cause ramping locus cerules
phase sleep? couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes guests
talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,

00:54:30 Locus Coeruleus, Learning & REM Sleep

mustolids, else I'll, take remainder time. love tell us
REM, sleep Sleep later night relates dreams emotionality,
probably um appropriate time introduce us incredible
structure brain, locus ceruleus. difficult um structure spell,
beautiful, beautifully named structure um find Lucas release just fascinating
know know small fraction hoping going educate
audience hopefully tell us little bit
relationship epinephrine AKA, adrenaline yeah, glad brought
can totally geek locus list. Please Locus, meaning spot place
serverless meaning blue. just call blue spot. That’s easiest. Every
animal brain blue spot um yeah, mean every animal
brain course, animals nervous systems not centralized like
jellyfish um, anyway digressing there. um, locus release filled
neurons them. Norepinephrine, brain's version epinephrine
adrenaline, also called noradrenaline just like adrenaline rest
bodies. helps Primus respond environment. Locus rulis, neurons,
Fire Fire burst, can switch attention will fire burst. If,
example, loud noise happens middle concentrating something, can
helps fires helps switch attention thing learn quickly
it. it’s really important stress response. helps us. quick one, trial, learning
tonic activity day you're, just know normal, going
normal concentration kind activity activities really good sustained
attention it. works cholinergic system basal forebrain, really
important learning memory also help us learn things put things together,
just Tonica level levels signature wakefulness alertness. much panic
local surrealist activity. burst switching attention tonic levels
sustained constant attention then, go sleep, locus cerealis slows
goes average two Hertz one Hertz one cycle per second tonically.
go REM sleep. It’s time shuts off completely,
appears complete silence really really important number things,
main thing think it’s important ability erase break synapses
no longer working us, encode things false now encoding
things learned novelty encoding Pathways brain now
Consolidated Pathways, need Now erase novelty


encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

aware that? Can turn output locus ceruleus phases
sleep matter, things can cause ramping locus cerules
phase sleep? couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes guests
talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

encoding pathway really really important able continue learn things
lives like erasing REM um don't know, call discs
stick computers, that'll, uh, hard drive, uh, no um, erasing Thumb drive
thumb drive carry around day long sleep. write
thumb drive cortex long-term memory structures need refresh
thumb drive that’s happens REM sleep locus cerealis off,
whenever it’s neurodrenaline there, helps us put things together.
helps us learn strengthen synapses, not allow us actually weaken
synapses also really important part Life. Important part lifelong learning, um
yeah, much more. say that. Yeah Lucas Aurelia sounds fascinating,
it’s connected basal forebrain cholinergic system, um neurons Locust
ceruleus. not mistaken, release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine well uh um.
Well, no, brain's version epinephrine norepinephrine um. thing also uh
precursor norepinephrine dopamine, source dopamine
hippocampus seems locus cereals it’s still mystery, conditions.
Locust rules also releases dopamine, it’s really important learning
something new also release dopamine least activate dopaminergic receptors
hippocampus, yeah dopamine norepinephrine also galanin,
important releasing stressed helps also without rapid learning.
works concert norepinephrine needs strengthen
synapses learn really quickly. love um multiple molecules
involved, signals us principle, that, even people can't remember
names um rarely biology something handled just one. Molecular pathway.
redundancy rule yeah, signaling attention specific events
important going use just story. always say know wasn't
consulted design phase, makes sense redundancy exist
system absolutely fact, form hypotheses brain, always
wrong, reason always wrong it’s complicated
like think brains, forming hypotheses, it’s fail
account factors involved. know glia, neuropeptides,
neurotransmitters, physical structure synapses, going grad
school 35 years ago, uh we, Dogma, every neuron contains one
neurotransmitter releases one neurotransmitter excitatory
neurotransmitters inhibitory neurotransmitters Neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
that’s complicated got started talking neuropeptides people
said: oh no, please don't don't complicate start talking neurons


contain neuropeptides neurotransmitters maybe one
neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones too. Even hormones - oh Lord - know it’s
just complicated got ta admit that’s works right every time brain teaches
us something new didn't hypothesize. say. Oh, course,
wouldn't work. way hypothesized it, know actually need redundancy.
need systems work together, it’s uh daunting sometimes, also
ensures many many careers science Neuroscience particular

01:01:46 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Locus Coeruleus & Sleep

um note aspiring scientists plenty room uh Discovery. want
talk norepinephrine yeah? Yes, well, love? love um tell
us about! know role lack norepinephrine released rapid eye
movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep

antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa

noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another

take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,

movement? Sleep thought achieve, maybe also review
work describing conditions norepinephrine invades, yeah, rapid eye
movements, sleep patterns sleep can detrimental yeah.
lot hypothetical, based lot good evidence sewing together
schema hypotheses come. model schema
hypotheses come. one thing happens people post-traumatic stress disorder
lot evidence locus cerealis doesn't stop firing REM sleep so,
whereas levels norepinephrine might similar people without PTSD
day even First part night wee hours morning
measure norepinephrine levels metabolites blood cerebral spinal fluid,
see people PTSD it’s wee hours morning
REM sleep neuropinephrine levels, differentiate
don't PTSD, that’s evidence locus reality not shutting
REM. Sleep like evidence heart rate variability. Locus
realist firing, heart rates generally little higher don't vary much
locusceralis not firing. slow wave, sleep normally big
juicy variability heart rate, every breath breath out, neurodenergie
levels norepinephrine levels lower REM, sleep goes away entirely
heart rate is, um, dominated parasympathetic, rather sympathetic activity,
also brain driving, know dreaming about. example,
Dreaming running, heart rates will go up, norepinephrine levels still
low off people PTSD neurodenergics studying rats too. true


Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty
encoding structure purge traumatic memory. will

aware that? Can turn output locus ceruleus phases
sleep matter, things can cause ramping locus cerules
phase sleep? couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes guests
talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

Locus cells doesn't um shut off post-traumatic stress disorder
preliminary evidence yes, it’s true doesn't shut off.
norepinephrine act synapses prevent weakening really need,
example, novelty, encoding structures, keeps memories novelty encoding
structure, even it’s Consolidated rest brain, hippocampus,
important remembering things throughout lives it’s thumb drive um,
need erased can learn new things it’s Consolidated
hard drive cortex, so, not able fill Ram um
really quickly thumb drive really quickly not able learn new things. So,
example, trauma talked locus responding stressful situations. That’s
great it’s adaptive, need stop learned need
learn want go sleep, need locus Less calm
REM, sleep. want stop then, Consolidated
traumatic memory cortex, need erase novelty encoding structures,
example hippocampus, then, context safety, can
learn new things. new contexts um stop responding
stimuli though original situation. not able erase thumb
drive, will always feel like trauma happened day like earlier day
respond early, recent trauma beating heart
that, even Memories years past, never able downscale novelty

aware that? Can turn output locus ceruleus phases
sleep matter, things can cause ramping locus cerules
phase sleep? couple: podcast episodes, solo episodes guests
talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,

talking trauma, Dr Paul Conte who's. Stanford train, Harvard train um
psychiatrist, talked lot trauma, wrote excellent book trauma um.
Certainly, sleep emphasized key thing. Like get enough sleep,
saying even somebody trauma gets enough sleep Locus ceruleus hyperactive
sleep. traumas going persist trauma treatments
aware everything ranging cognitive. Behavioral therapy talk therapy drug therapy,
EMDR hypnosis um. Nowadays, lot interest attention um clinical studies
exploring psychedelics, high-dose, psilocybin MDMA. it’s vast landscape, none
which, far know, really focused sleep specifically no not,
actually psychedelics sleep-like state um. It’s rem, sleep-like
State, although course major differences. yeah much talk
antidepressants um often neurodenergic serotonergic reuptake Inhibitors.
leave norepinephrine actually synapses. does?
inhibits REM, sleep able get REM sleep, probably REM sleep
neurogenergic activity. actually think anyway, not physician
antidepressants counter-indicated. don't want take them. experienced
trauma experiencing PTSD, anything, it’s going make worse
least prevent type adaptive REM sleep really need order resolve
emotions move um. statement specific antidepressants tickle,
noradrenergic pathway, one comes mind can never pronounce brupa
prion, uh. think brand name Wellbutrin, it’s dopaminergic
noradrenergic Agonist, that’s net effect. opposed Prozac Zoloft variety,


ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

ssris - yes, yes, ssris - also problematic didn't talk
yet. dorsal rafae nucleus, produces serotonin, specifics
serotonin specific serotonin reuptake Inhibitors block reuptaken, leaves much
serotonin serotonin also another neurodenergic, sorry, another
neurotransmitter, that’s regulated REM, sleep, that’s specifically off REM,
sleep serotonin does? weights cognition able recognize
novelty again, sort Waits brain away sense familiarity toward
novelty um? might one reason it’s effective antidepressant,
makes world feel fresh new right, you, much you're,
holding novel, traumatic memory um novelty encoding structure strongly
already. don't want weight things toward novelty. need absence
Serotonin also help get sense familiarity start erasing novelty
encoding structures. need absent. It’s really interesting. hear lot
serotonin uh. It’s not often discussed terms features related novelty
enough. think, just described, accused something Dr Paul conti
others said terms trauma, paraphrasing. apologies
not getting exactly right, effective treatment trauma not
erase traumatic memory, causes transition disturbing
invasive maladaptive eventually just become kind boring old story. kind
fuzzy texture it, opposed kind sharp High friction, texture invades
thinking, um obviously sleeping States well um, uh. appreciate
disclaimer caveats around. know not clinician Etc, think
lot interest now whether not antidepressants effective trauma not,
think aspects neuromodulation relate um. call erasing
traumas changing emotional load traumas sleep. Um something important
take note. also lot clinicians

01:12:29 Locus Coeruleus, Bedtime & Novelty, Estrogen & Trauma

Listen podcast, also take note um, please. want reduce
amount norepinephrine released Locus ceruleus rapid eye movement, sleep
eliminate troubling maybe even traumatic memories allow late stages sleep
night maximum positive effect, anything can do? Besides,
avoiding um, avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic neuroadrenergic compounds well,
also avoid anything just prior going sleep might excite systems lot


novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

novelty. lot know, exciting um stress, inducing video games, try enter sleep
much calm can maybe deep breathing exercises that’s beautiful way
calm sympathetic. Fight-Or-Flight system deep breathing haven't able
test rats can't ask deep, breathing exercise. might
way can that, haven't found figured yet. way
can make sympathetic system nervous system, calm go sleep,
might free you, meditation deep breathing exercises might warm bath
comforting book. Nothing exciting, um. Also, nothing boring. Perhaps um just
something right middle, makes feel happy calm
instead go sleep you're, anxious um hyped up, sleep
become maladaptive. Another thing happens rats yet know
happens women, female rats three phases Ester cycle Locus
realist doesn't seem calm REM sleep much, don't know why.
high estrogen phases estracycle, locus shuts just like
male rats, three phases doesn't um. One thing might work
fact studies show it. work. Really well um uh, giving women
trauma event something contains estrogen, estrogen somehow
protective PTSD, know retrospective studies, gave
women emergency room, either pill estrogen without, pill
estrogen much less likely get PTSD trauma measured year
later pill without um. really good Studies
Bronwyn, Graham she's, Australia, really hone much estrogen
need also testosterone? Just know gets converted estrogen brain.
testosterone also can protective gets converted estrogen,
something estrogen. That’s really helpful protective high
Locos cyrillus firing - preliminary data don't full. don't
answers yet um. looking actively right now, it’s really important.
thing women two four times susceptible anxiety-
related mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
figure happening locus oralis sleep women, um
figure way normalize locus realist silent needs silent,
think go long way

01:16:22 Sex Differences & Sleep



Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

Helping women resilient stress related disorders. um sex
differences relate sleep, yeah, yeah? That’s really good question:
studies, unfortunately, uh women sleep, um, women estracycle
menstrual cycle, sleep um. found, actually largely
replicated study 1960 um, women females, rather high estrogen High
hormonal phases estracycle menstrual cycle sleep lot less, sleep
efficient sleep dense. sleep spindles, haven't gone into,
might do, except connection hippocampus cortex, it’s
sleep spindles, dense coherent across brain areas. Theta
cycle, 5 10 Hertz hippocampus important one year, learning also
important REM. Sleep also bigger juicier high hormonal phases.
even though less sleep, it’s efficient better um, uh.
efficiency seems reduced hormonal phases um. So, even though
might sleep little um, might need sleep. fact, order accomplish
thing can get short um, efficient sleep high hormonal phases
interesting, think um. growing Trend, least among nih-funded grants
require refer grants, biological sex variable yeah,
talking sex, um verb - although sure studies too.
biological sex variable dearth studies exploring sex differences
everything, sorts reasons that, but, importantly, that,
fortunately, trend Shifting yeah um even study males versus females
lot People just say include females studies, don't track estracycle
menstrual cycle hormones huge effects Behavior. mean just think
sex. know hormones come not interested
suddenly know, that’s kind main driver behaviors hormones can definitely change
studying hormones, not just sex. always say
puberty perhaps massive transformation rate Aging us go
short amount time, individual, cognition changes,

01:19:12 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Insomnia, Meditation, Prayer

Worldview changes that’s largely hormonal, driven obviously neural architecture
changed um. happy mentioned trying get Commerce States
prior sleep ways that. big fan - talked lot
podcast things like Yoga Nidra, non-movement based practice, sometimes


called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

called non-sleep depressed, people actually take time day practice
go parasympathetic, AKA relaxed State. Deliberately it’s bit
skill, yeah yeah, it’s um good data, really mostly laboratory
Scandinavia, showing huge increases um Nigro, striatal dopamine, people go
basically engage practice deliberate um non-movement Brain actually
enters states shallow sleep, sort nap-ish. idea actually stay
awake motionless, seem restore certain number features
neurochemistry. perhaps importantly, teaches people relax,
something people not good um event, um people
listen podcast heard say again. sound like broken
record, practice zero cost practice doesn't require pharmacology
seem really enhance people's ability fall asleep quickly fall back asleep
wake middle night. So, event, another plug nsdr Yoga Nidra.
Well, just also want add that. That’s one reasons insomnia Insidious
people feel like haven't gotten enough sleep aren't getting enough
sleep become anxious getting enough sleep anxious going
sleep like I'm, not going fall asleep, it’s Going 45 minutes that’s
positive feedback loop, need bring break Loop, say: okay, body's going
get much sleep needs. needn't worry practice relaxation
say: hey. It’s all! Okay, it’s going right concentrate things relax
um, whether it’s concentrating not, concentrating whatever is. mentioned um
Yoga Nidra, reminded Transcendental Meditation, something
also hasn't studied well largely, can't ask non-human animals it.
don't know happening neurochemistry brain activity.
deep meaningful way, one thing shown can
really well, Theta activity said happens learning something
REM, sleep it’s well established increases
Transcendental Meditation, might states meditation ways
re, replace mimic functions of, example, REM, sleep. don't know
neurochemistry right do. example, thing talking about,
erasing novelty encoding structures, brain needs absence norepinephrine
serotonin, don't know goes away Transcendental Meditation.
just don't know answer that. Yet yeah. studies Yoga, Nidra sleep
replacement kind interesting um. seem case nothing can really
replace sleep except sleep, one sleep deprived trouble falling back
asleep um things like - hear it’s - acknowledge essentially like Yoga


Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,

Nidra, now Call non-sleep deep, breast nsdr, oftentimes names like
Yoga Nidra act kind barrier uh. otherwise um people willing try
practice? sounds mystical. sounds like flying carpets know sounds like
go esslin way esselyn's beautiful place, sounds like go
live west coast believe stuff. it’s simply not case.
practices really just um self-directed relaxation practice allows
people get better better directing brain States towards relaxation,
people asymmetry like, instance, people can force stay
later, hard time going sleep earlier just speaks
asymmetry - that’s probably adaptive survival, based can ramp far
easily can tend calm yeah, actually know appeal
Christians, like me, prayer, can wonderful way calm
prayer giving cares God saying know,
relaxed relaxed. just want say that, reason yoga might
put people off, might put people off um talk prayer. it’s
process able relax yeah get outside experience. little bit
experience, yeah, um back out, get world view might actually also help us relax um.
Well, might surprised many um clinicians scientists who've come on.
podcast mentioned things like prayer various perspectives: Christianity, Judaism,
Muslim traditions others um parallel things - think
speaks fact ultimately, biological architectures contending
Going identical, right different ways tap ones
um congruent people's beliefs, think - great yeah um yeah, anything
non-congruent beliefs also stressful, right feels forced, that’s
know Idea calling non-sleep deep rest addition Yoga Nidra not detract
naming history around Yoga Nidra, finding barrier
know likewise. Um gon na need attempts include things like intentions,
whereas nsdr scripts, way will provide links nscr Yoga Nidra
scripts. nsdr no intentions. It’s simply body scan deep relaxation based. it’s sort
scientific version stuff actually study laboratory
brain states people go into, that’s discussion another time.
hard. mother used tell said well, play. can't go sleep, say
well, know start toes relax, clench muscles around
toes relax way toes way head -
don't know Got this, might common sense might
gotten uh NP NPR show it’s called mind, can keep well, least


listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less

sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking

listen to, that’s another intentional relaxation focuses body um rather
mental processes, little bit work military um
method within certain communities Special Operations US military where,
can't sleep challenges sleeping, will deliberately try relax
facial Muscles, particular, like sort drape, facial muscles use long exhale
emphasized breathing seem increase probability transitioning back sleep
Hallmarks Yoga, Nidra, non-sleep, deep rest body scans and,
think, things Converge common theme, know, neurobiologist,
can say things describing certainly move needle away
Locus ceruleus activation, haven't done experiment really look that.
seems things counter noradrenaline release. Another one yawning self
kind sort tensing muscles face relaxing them.
might don't know yawn yet um, might also have.
really great. Actually animals. Yawn too, know Bulldog Perpetual
wasn't sleeping, yawning interesting see yawning
Lucas realist. also come switch local circles activity, it’s
interesting facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, know vagus, connects
um indirectly locus aurelis powerful effect interesting uh common.
think friend direct colleague, viewers, uh Jack Feldman, guest
podcast telling us amazing structures. others discovered
respiration breathing. Yeah sounds like collaboration

01:27:42 Sleep Spindles, Learning & Creativity, P Waves & Dreaming

Brewing here, three us definitely carry love share
us little bit spindles come times, don't know
it’s relevant this. it’s not, separate out, love tell us little bit
role sleep problem, solving creativity spindles involved I'll.
Consider lucky batching question not involved,
simply feel free separate out. think involved reason
think involved, now know lot spindles. First all,
first thing knew first all, ignored them. thought something
keeping us asleep, function external stimulus came.
keep us asleep arise. now know density
sleep spindles, number produce per minute, well correlated


intelligence first place no matter intelligence no matter
sleep spindle density is, learn something day increase sleep,
spindle density, it’s really almost perfectly correlated ability consolidate
information incorporate schema already brain. try
learn something new, even sleep, spindle density Baseline, great,
don't increase sleep spindles night you're, not gon na, know, use sleep really
incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles poor schizophrenia. It’s one
characteristic signatures sleep sleep spindles far
might mean um, people schizophrenia might not able incorporate
new information already existing schema instead, sort Flaps breeze
can accessed erroneously times you, know, don't want
involved um, digress, sleep, spindles creativity. one things now
know great Studies Julie, seat Anita luthy, sleep spindles
accompanied incredible plasticity distal dendrites, listening branches
neurons, listen cortical areas. proximal dendrites
neurons listen external world conducted thalamus,
distal dendrites listen internal kind know, conversation that’s
happening brains. It’s kind know internal State really
sleep spindles. That’s distal dendrites able best learn cortical
areas hippocampus. sleep spindles hippocampus
cortex best connected class, incredible plasticity can happen. talk
schema, that’s cortical cortical thing: that’s know image Santa Claus
presence know comes together. It’s not external thing, learn
things together, it’s cortex encodes brings images back
together sleep spindles, that’s happening big surges
calcium distal dendrites plasticity happens just huge amounts,
sleep, spindle stage sleep, N2 stage, also another
excitatory event comes way brain stem projects everywhere
cortex, called pgo waves. That’s P pons G ingeniculate nucleus
thalamus, first discovered O occipital area, visual
area, first discovered. fact it’s now shown pgo
waves, generalize p waves come ponds go
thalamus, cortex happens brains. glutamate,
major excitatory neurotransmitter involved learning plasticity,
released big amounts, also distal dendrites. p, waves spindles work
together cause plasticity, schema together, origins


insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,

insight creativity. Now, pgo waves p waves, first discovered, thought
random, small area generates p waves brain, know
projects thalamus causes p waves don't measure p
waves. brain time, fact it’s just seems sporadic random.
that’s, probably p waves also happening even REM, sleep, rapid eye
movement, sleep. So, that’s probably that’s people think REM dreams
Random p waves random generate dreams
they're, internal source excitation. kind replaces outside world
dream state, p waves, random, function,
underlying reason REM sleep dreams random, might also creativity
can happen. randomly activating co-activating different things
brain can sew together, might not random think so. That’s
caveat there. just learned lot teach brain stem medical students
talk pawns pawns like dense collection different
nuclei involved bunch different things. it’s close bunch interesting things
it’s still kind mysterious brain area. learned pgo waves, thought
pawns geniculate occipital, occipital commonly associated visual
cortex. thought origin visual component dreams. probably
happy learn called p waves, include lots different
areas brain, makes really good sense kind pseudo-
randomness Dreams, especially late night early morning, um later sleep
say, early morning, dreams seem cobbled together kind disparate
experiences. mean walk door suddenly it’s completely different context
Landscape. Yes, um beautiful yeah. like idea lot. makes intuitive sense,
makes biological sense. also gives something talk medical students
next quarter. talk pawns - want talk ponds it’s
right locus surlist, it’s called sub surrealists glutamatergic. It’s also
called sld sublateral dorsal nucleus. love um note aspiring neurobiologist
vast landscape yet undiscovered structure functions pond.
want work something sure reveal something novel work palms,
it’s every textbook, it’s clinically, important structure, um, sadly, gliomas
can another cancers brain can sometimes can often

01:34:51 Lucid Dreams, Reoccurring Dreams, Trauma



Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought

Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though

memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember

know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-

Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:

Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep

work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.

intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid

Surface ponds, still know little it. Um read paper
last year - think covered bit popular press - rapid eye
movement, sleep people can solve problems respond external stimuli like, instance,
give math problems, whisper Ear, REM,
sleep, know, two plus two people say, even though
paralyzed, apparently still move mouth say four something
like say know. name people respond
REM sleep, perhaps people um, elements cognition still active. glad
brought out. think don't know authors study um uh
listen. Ever say something wrong, it’s great podcast, someone will tell us
YouTube comments it’s one great uses YouTube comments, love
know thoughts study mean: just kind Odd feature
meaning, actually care result, no just it. It’s
really actually intriguing interesting might relate paper talked
we, said different areas brain, can different states.
time, lucid dreaming another thing. can't ask animals can't ask
done um. can certainly ask humans people can
really well, really interesting see people lucid dream
really well, whether spend less time asymmetrical state, one area
Brain one state another area. brain another, might
people can respond questions REM. Sleep best
asymmetry dissimilarity dissociation subcortical cortical structures,
might they're, ones symmetry don't know um. worry little
bit lucid dreamy, people it’s fad. People really excited
able remember one's dreams fun, often unless nightmares, it’s
really interesting able direct one's dreams nightmare. really
wonderful power able redirect nightmare repeated
something else kick repetitive nightmare really nice, um.
worry little bit know little about. actually going brain,
lucid dreaming state preventing us from, example, locus realist
calming serotonergic system silencing like should, maybe
state yeah. activating learning memory structures,
way, that’s maladaptive terms Erasure need so. Maybe one
reasons people don't remember dreams good reason.
hippocampus state it’s not writing new memories. fact, writing it’s
memories learned day cortex it’s immune incoming new


information, um, maybe lucid dreaming bad activating
hippocampus way, that’s writing new memories, might really maladaptive
things like know, PTSD, hand, let just argue right
used repeated nightmare kid mother wise
tell well listen just next time. dream, know, say: hey dream
change something it. rehearsed horrible dream
was. big monster. know running legs like mud
couldn't run away just terrifying, dream know
time time said okay, next time. gon na that? Monster?
Comes laugh, gon na run away. No, that’s every time
it’s always outcome can't run. something different like
do? That’s different, came I'll. turn around punch
nose, yeah, that’s great next time dream. recognize
old dream, means part brain - that’s conscious enough
know dreaming State didn't, courage dream,
still terrified punch. know touch monster way,
courage turn around look eye say no. enough. said
no, enough knock Rhett dream, never
again. never dream fact gave peace dreaming,
knew ever nightmare just scary. probably
something change knock it. So, even though don't recommend
lucid dreaming normal day-to-day basis, it’s enough can knock rut,
one thing happens people PTSD repeated horrible
nightmare, often reliving day's trauma maybe lucid
dreaming can used occasion powerful tool much plasticity
happens REM sleep knock ret reliving event just
change it. know, probably practice, wakefulness um rehearse
event happened, traumatic just introduce new element. Like
know, now safe now know sound associated really
traumatic thing. now associate something else next time dream,
going change sound now new thing associated
safety, might enough - maybe hope, um knock Repeated
Nightmare maybe even start path recovery, can calm
nightmare stads sleep, maybe Loca cyrillus, involved
stress, can also relax can Erasure parts need done. love it,
seem recall paper find reference um send you. will


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
researchers discover. So, thank brain Explorer um, focus um
growing, good world um. know speak everybody say thank
much. Thank much Andrew. Thank amazing interviewer.
brought lot coherent form fashion normally, can't speaking
public. don't know that. heard lectures superb direct people
ones. Well, thank you, also want put plug graduate
students general key amazing role play research um. pi.
said, used graduate student postdoc trainee
ground. Hands-On experimentation, it’s hard it’s hard right, it’s hard
think through. now pi. get idea, person just say hey:
don't hey know? think that, they, course,
intellectually contribute much planned experiments, also
really hard work, just want say thank graduate students, thank
graduate students graduate students thank you, underpaid listen
major institutions. Stanford UCLA major institutions pay more.
Please! Yes, need need standard living. Not not afraid
say despite primary employer pay more, need it, deserve it.
deserve absolutely great. Well, will absolutely back you,
willing - meanwhile will

high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate

Dr Gina Poe, sleep relationship mental health, physical health
performance last, certainly, not least, thank interest science. [. Music ]


also put show note captions described protocol essentially matches um
uh idea well. think people either cue particular
smell tone wakefulness, then, try recall recurring nightmare yeah then,
night's sleep tone playing background, cue
wakeful State still asleep mind you, pseudo, Lucid Lucid State,
try change variable describing either look um predator
eyes something different yeah waking State. Take little bit
time try script different um narrative altogether, took several nights
recall more, able escape recurring nightmare. like week
something yeah, familiar guy. It’s beautiful study, loved yeah.
will put reference that. um need revisit site. pretty recent, need
dive think didn't go deep I. no no,
one thing you, said many right things, one things said
able cue dreamer um knew going REM, sleep,
played sound odor now, you're, normally asleep alone
bed, not going able cue yourself, might rehearsal enough
go sleep. enough know, help cue repeated nightmare,
remembering nightmare figuring cue
something different years recurring nightmare
again, Salient clear not going share is, it’s
um it’s not it’s disturbing just. think emotional load just
Salient certain features like one person um who's, real life person
particular um clothing, yeah it’s like, just served cue yeah. don't
know ever direct work try deal it, now almost seems silly
describe it. Oh yeah, well, dreams usually silly describe. pretty violent
Dreams. Yeah emotional system geared REM, sleep,
another thing talk yeah, please um, love yeah Locus. Aurelius
ideally suppressed, can't release norepinephrine. can't act dreams um
uh emotionally Laden, um thoughts storylines sleep.
almost like, starts sound like little bit built-in um, sleeping trauma therapy,
trauma therapies involve trying get people states um counter
people think actually want get close trauma. terms narrative
try suppress emotional activity - guess that’s - motivation
ketamine-based therapies trauma, also heard - still perplexing -
waking based trauma therapies involve taking people way. Making
cathartic take peak emotional



01:44:11 Trauma Recovery, Locus Coeruleus & Norepinephrine, REM Sleep

Response allow finally cycle relaxed response. please
um, anything Locust, ceruleus dreams, can help people
basically extinguish traumas traumatic features real life events. definitely
want know yeah yeah. Well, think one things people thought might
help trauma like school shooting whatever know. Car accident talk
in, fact ended counterproductive, think one reasons
counterprotective didn't take back um. brought
continued reactivate emotions it. didn't know, emphasize
safety effect it’s um help work might avoid
future calm sympathetic nervous system went sleep, -
none studies sleep ever considered, that’s, key part
bringing sympathetic nerve system go sleep sleep can
adaptive. Locus realist can shut off like normally does, able
erase novelty it. thing um just mentioned minute ago,
emotion system highly activated REM, sleep that’s definitely true, might
seem counterproductive terms know nightmares help REM.
Sleep therapeutic thing. Rather um reinforcing emotionality
trauma - think key absence norepinephrine. So, even though
emotional system high gear, without norepinephrine, can actually divorce
highly activated emotions cognitive parts memory just written
NT stage sleep sleep spindles going um, Just now
Consolidated information need survive know make
adaptive now need divorce schema semantic parts
memory. emotional part, whenever remember something fine,
remember emotional time, don't want bring back
memory emotional systems. don't want bring back. know
heart rate, changes sweating, want able remember
parts even remember traumatized cry
know heart racing, talking years later,
don't want relive that. Otherwise, ever want recall
dramatic memory you're, basically putting trauma,
people PTSD, don't want recall? traumatic memory,


it’s reliving like it’s just happening again. that’s thinking um,
emotional parts no longer not able divorced norepinephrine
system not downscaled REM, sleep REM sleep serves to. Instead
reinforce fact amplify emotions, emotional system up, look
surilis, says Hi re-sewing every night, emotionality memories
memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing
wakes us up, hearts racing together brain racing. just
don't know answers questions. Yet good good studies, old
studies, need lot more. will another nod

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned

memory um told us lot Locus, Aurelius norepinephrine Locus cerules.
role um, norepinephrine, epinephrine cortisol released
adrenals? understanding norepinephrine epinephrine will not cross blood-
brain barrier, probably brain-based neurogenergic system, yeah
Locus ceruleus neurons. Actually, that’s question. ask you:
sites brain norepinephrine released just Locus,
cerules um? are, just occurred um, cases like raphae,
sources serotonergic Drive brain. raphae like means.
Yeah, that’s one goes cortex locus roles also one
goes cortex. adrenergic sources, brain stem
descend help us ignore pain, example, um. stressed needing
run away tiger right, don't want thinking. Oh ankle hurts know
want just able ignore go need um yeah.
lots neurogenergic nuclei, local sterility main one projects
brain. actually place doesn't project dorsal striatum. talked
ventral, striatum addiction. dorsal stratum place. locus Rose
doesn't project that’s involved in, procedural learning motor learning. kinds
learning take hippocampus, example, compromised. Bilateral.
don't good hippocampus, can still procedural learning it’s great
it’s redundant system um. Locus cerealis not working, don't
anymore, can still you, don't, good hippocampus, can still
learning dorsal stratum structure, might kinds learning
functions: sleep deprivation, never let locus really stop. Firing okay,
doesn't receptors norepinephrine anyway, yeah,
bodily um like adrenals, yeah um, know, often remind people no thing
adrenal burnout per se. adrenals don't actually burn um, people
adrenal insufficiency syndrome. people adrenals just chronically
cranking out, epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol wrong times particular, yeah
yeah, great questions think answers yet
discovered. connections periphery central nervous system,
know beautiful connections it’s untapped source able


manipulate brains work bodies, adrenals great things.
constrict blood vessels causing higher blood pressure help blood rush
extremities need blood um. know muscles, example, running away
lion um Tiger, meeting grant deadline catching train catching
train. Yeah adrenals help hearts bump faster. muscles get profused
blood needs. diverts blood everything away parasympathetic system,
rest digest. don't really need digest croissant running
train. can later um. it’s really important things. don't know
doesn't cross blood-brain barrier, affects brain whether
our, can independently activate adrenals um time brain thinks
fine calm asleep. brain detects. feedback
heart racing, brainstem says going on. heart racing

01:52:15 Opiates, Addiction, Relapse & Sleep

Fact lots great work ongoing still love tell us
work recently relationship sleep
opiate, use, withdrawal, relapse um craving just addiction generally uh. get lot
questions people trying come off benzodiazepines people's challenges
benzodiazepine types addiction, um yeah. What? role sleep
addiction recovery addiction opiates, particular yeah? young
area fact laboratory just started. graduate student
lab just one year. done amazing work already, completely groundbreaking work
discovered already. don't paper yet, working
animals withdraw opiates - sort replicated
ways types things, sleep Disturbed, sleep terribly Disturbed
amount sleep disturbance Predicts relapse behaviors might think well course
going relapse. can't sleep opiates calm well, one
reasons opiates calm locus cerealis loose fat covered
opiate receptors normally really responsive endogenous opiates, um
what? happens pleased, example, laughing whatever
Dodges opiates um activate receptors locus rules calm actually


suppresses Locus activity makes us happy relaxed. One things reasons
opiates addictive also calms us makes us relaxed,
problem exogenous opiates really strongly bind receptors
Locus cerillas. take exogenous opiates again, like recovering
surgery, example, take pain medications Locus really struggles
it’s supposed do, keep us awake learning concentrating
things. will down. Regulate will internalize receptors normally
occupied endogenous opiates, and, will this, will change genes
associated producing receptors, actually many fewer receptors.
locus rules, least wakefulness, can fire help us things like
learn environment, so, long term reduce number receptors
there, withdraw exogenous opiates, it’s not enough endogenous
opiates able reoccupy receptors local spirulis
nothing calm down, anymore, no pacifier just fires fires fires,
phasic tonic High activity stresses us out, it’s normally associated stress
exogenous stressor adds also activates Locus roles,
nothing calm again, just keeps firing. disturbs sleep that’s
maybe sleep disturbance indicator hyperactive Locus, cerillas um
good predictor relapsed behaviors, nobody likes live high stress state
anything get back normal. problem um taking drugs
leaves excited sorry excited, relaxed happy, then,
come off worse whether anywhere Baseline, take um.
brings far fewer receptors come off
even depressed anxious depressed word use Loosely
that’s not that’s not certainly central nervous system depression. mean sleepier less
motivated, lower mood. Yeah mean local surrealis actually it’s it’s anxiety
kind depression. Actually, anxiety related depression, um yeah, don't know
yet good research going right now? restore
endogenous receptors doogenous opiates can properly calm Locus
tamped exogenous opiates, really one way
can access sleep disturbance. talked sleep importance
sleep terms learning memory, importance structure 90-minute
cycle. that. can imagine. sleep disturbed much Locos
activity, structure function sleep spindles Theta
REM, sleep lack norepinephrine structures. functions
learning something new like new behavior doesn't involve drugs becomes


compromised, that’s something Tanya lugos collaboration Pamela
Kennedy UCLA looking learning memory affected sleep
disturbance? way can um animals coming off opiates? Can
restore sleeps normal, less likely relapse kinds
behaviors, fascinating I'm? will certainly back tell us results
studies. Meanwhile, think anyone, trying come off opiates, exogenous
opiates restore systems um. hearing it’s going take time,
things people can buffer healthy normal sleep architecture
like morning daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering temperature
night, number things talked podcast deep breathing exercises
meditation whatever is. helps calm sleep yeah right would.
facilitate not just sleep perhaps even accelerate recovery um
shorten period withdrawal which, questions get hear um
can absolutely brutal, yeah um. can imagine take opiates, took
three days giving birth um first son. think Second Son, one um,
just just said three days. enough. just going try Tylenol, leaned
myself, not weaned. just sudden sharp cut off, even though felt didn't get
high opiates taking um Tylenol codeine um, went off boy,
like PMS times 100. anxious upset little things. thankfully lasted
hours, taken week two weeks knows endogenous opiate
receptors permanently regulated addict,
know addict, addicted. shouldn't say addict: negative
connotations: it’s just physiological state, no judgments associated it,
um yeah, they're, powerful, powerful painkillers, can also alter entire brain
rewire. yeah well, um. reason many others grateful
work figure ways people can recover um quickly
thoroughly. must say: taught us tremendous amount um relatively short
amount time architecture sleep, different phases, relationship
sleep dreaming, incredible structure Locus cerules happy. also
got ponds just Delights uh rarely talk pawns
podcast, interesting structure, sex differences important creativity
problem solving um Trauma sleep spindles. Just wealth information
much it, that’s actionable people. So, first all, want say thank taking
time sit conversation many people sure benefit from.
also want thank work do, even though fellow neurobiologist,
think um, it’s not often um take step back realize it’s really work


um hard thinking hard um strongly motivated pis. stands principal investigator
way pis like graduate students postdocs really drive discovery forward
lead new Therapeutics Physicians wonderful. Clinicians absolutely
wonderful, clinicians don't develop new treatments. implement ones
