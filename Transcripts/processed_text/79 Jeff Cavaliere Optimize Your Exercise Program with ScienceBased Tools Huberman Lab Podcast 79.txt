00:08:38 Tool: Fitness Plan General Health

enter code Huberman checkout. now discussion Jeff
Cavaliere. Jeff, pleasure here. - glad here,
amazing. - longtime consumer content. learned tremendous amount
fitness, weight room cardio, nutrition things applied
decade. me, particularly meaningful. goal really
ask bunch questions interested answers, also
know audience really curious about. one mantras is, "If want look
like athlete, train like athlete" think something really special sets
aside lot well qualified people do. terms
use weights resistance, whether not body weight weights gym,
pulleys versus cardio, terms overall health aesthetics athleticism,
way point idea maybe people 50% resistance
training 50% cardio, maybe 70/30, maybe 30/70. talking
typical person like maintain, maybe even add muscle mass,
probably particular areas people, opposed just overall mass. Although
talk later, people want maintain relatively low body fat
percentage good cardiovascular health. sort contour basic
program anybody think starting place? - think like 60/40 split,
leaning towards weight training, strength conditioning
aspect 40%. look course training week, mean, five
days gym great task. obviously not gym, done
home. three days strength training, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Conditioning,


Tuesday, Thursday, know, two days. pretty easy roundabout way split
up, course, depending upon training goals. said, aesthetic goals like
will shift dramatically. want see benefits both, probably
effect dose strength training effect dose conditioning bare
minimum level. Again, much better performer conditioning wise, going
want that. - terms duration workouts,
suggestion? weight training 30 years, running 30 years,
mainly health. found work hard gym resistance training
60 minutes so, hard recover, start getting cold, start
getting weaker workout workout, amazingly, least me, keep
workouts 10 minutes warmup 55 minutes really hard work
resistance training, keep cardiovascular work 30 45 minutes, feel
great. seem make progress, least someplace workout
workout workout. - Yeah, mean, good numbers, 'cause kind
numbers usually preach. try keep workouts hour less
possible. Now, depending upon split following, total body
split, just going done given amount time.
training primarily strength, prolong workout, 'cause
longer rest time sets. general, not focused
one aspect, overall health picture, can get job done
hour. again, always say, top "If want look like athlete train, like
athlete," is, "You either train longer train hard, can't both."
really believe focus me, busy life, lot things
believe not. like, want go hard want go get out.
find body also responds that, think lot guys' body respond that.
particularly start get older, think length workout actually
causes problems intensity doing. Particularly
warmed properly like said. found personally warmup
become integral part workout ever before. get
gym 20, going right over, one set, two sets, ready
go. know, never another workout warmup set
exercise rest day. not true anymore. found long
willing sort give little bit warmup, intensity not bothers me.
much control weights use doesn't bother me. start


go pretty long, start feel achy start problems. again, depending upon
age, also plays factor length. again, think everybody can achieve,

00:13:27 Tool: Optimizing Body Part Training Splits

standard program, can achieve results want within hour. - terms
splits, mentioned splits. aren't familiar term splits,
really body parts training on? days? Seems like almost
everybody follows weekly workout schedule. Although body course doesn't care
week. no reason thing every seven days twice every
seven days makes sense physiologically, just body doesn't work that. But,
way life structured. seen discuss three days week, whole body
workouts. heard splits like pushing one day, pulling another day, legs another
day, day off, repeat. mean, many variations this.
general themes can throw there? order avoid huge matrix
possibilities, wonderful content points those. will cap-
caption show notes, link different ways design splits.
terms giving people logic think splitting body parts,
governing split? rules logic dictate split? - me,
first rule will stick it? Like you, 'cause split, don't particularly like full
body splits. actually talking Jesse day like, don't
necessarily like train everything. Now course volumes will come
per muscle group. don't like that, actually don't look forward
workout dreading everything feeling maybe
fatigued time workout's over, fact generally take little
bit longer don't fit schedule. don't care effective split is, split not
done not effective. need find one fits. maybe go
alternative option, like push-pull-legs, like mentioned. done
either one cycle week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday split,
twice week. actually training six times, repeat it, pull-push-legs,
pull-push-legs, however want either day off three
days, end six days. again, actually impacts schedule.
broken it's, put three days, good
giving extra rest day between, starts shift day


off every week wrap around. guys choosing seven day
schedule convenience heads, starts mess off day. others
like just keep predictably, say Sunday, train six days row.
better way maybe group similar muscle actions together, think,
definitely prefer that, going training pulling movements, least
synergy them. feel like looking achieve one goal day.
then, mean, quite honestly, can go back bro-split days, still
work effectively. reason worked past. think science
shows smarter ways days. Like can come back hit
related muscle, do, say biceps one day come back two
days later back, realizing again, synergy exercises there,
biceps going get re-stimulated again. figure ways make
work, thing think effective there, tends one ones
people like most. can go in, get pump, feel good.
pretty solely focused one muscle group. - definition bro-split? One... -
One muscle group day? - Yeah, see, much geared towards strength
aesthetics really maximizing... - Probably aesthetics strength, yeah.
just... - Hence bro, bro name. - again, like, know, science
guy appreciate benefits bro-split. Especially 'cause again, like
end? goal trying achieve here? ours. Like applying
standards goals even like athletic ideals, just want get
shape, perfectly fine bro split instance, sticking
seeing results want see it. able really keep
focus one muscle, get focus on. Look, lot times people struggle
way exercise feels second third set. Like don't
proper percept ability kind lock exercise. spending few, not
sets exercise, another exercise muscle group
helps dial little bit better get training. - Yeah,
raised really interesting, think important question. Early started resistance
training, 16 high school, got touch learning
Mike Menzer. - too, crazy. - Mike helpful. Very, helpful.
got friendly... - So, just read book, didn't get chance him,
jealous, right? - Well, back no internet, paid Western Union type thing send
money - back magazine. - got phone


mother time like, grown man calling house?
gave straightforward split, shoulders, arms one day,
taking two days off training legs two days off chest
back, et cetera. - variation bro-split too. sort breaking
way, chest back chest bis, know? - worked
well me, probably would've, age think,
untrained, think, largely untrained, think would've grown many different programs,
worked well me. eventually just made every day thing.
Shoulders arms day off, legs day two off, 'cause hit legs right, least
me, not training next day. not much anything athletic
next day, chest, back repeat on. reason found helpful
almost always recovered workouts. six day week program push-pull-
legs, push-pull-legs, seems excruciating two standpoints. One is, least
recovery abilities, lack recovery abilities, can't imagine coming back
feeling fresh. one is, gym four days week, really
start fatigue whole psychological experience it. Whereas
three four days week. words, put day off workout,
really want there. get lot fire. also things
off days. think that, love mentioned split stick to.
can bring intensity to, think really important.
sometimes hear two day training. done two day training twice
lifetime,

00:20:12 Two-a-Day Training

times got sick two days later. correlation, not causation. ever
instance two day weight training makes sense non-drug assisted, typical
recovery ability person? - Actually, think makes sense scenarios,
doesn't make sense practically lot people's schedules. like break
down, say going even version total body session,
maybe like going upper lower split, right? upper workout
anterior chain pushing portion one session come
back pulling session later night, opportunity to. thing
benefit freshness focus. Again, like something head


sacrificed time get towards latter half whatever workout in.
point made like, start approach 50 minutes
hour mark, either losing focus, losing energy, losing contract
viability, losing something. relegating whatever is, pulling
portion end workout, something suffers that, realize
happening, maybe switch next time workout
pulling portion upper workout goes first, pushing goes
later, least not just continuing cycle, time,
able kind split up, get chance kind take break,
freshness focus again, actually get better effort in, 'cause again,
think effort drives results. effort not compromised,
able that. systemically problem? think problem
lot people. just hard to, hard rev engine lot times day.
warm thing once, like car winter, get going once,
lucky, okay, now got drive rest day. put garage
try start next day, problem. So, know, young people can get away
lot older people could. - Well, never strong recovery quotient,
stick one day off between, every while, two days row
training, maybe travel want make sure get workouts
kind thing, seem okay. like example warming car, spoken
like true east coaster, us west coast, took moment there,

00:22:33 Cardiovascular Conditioning, High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) & Skills

folks East Coast Midwest, get it, certainly Europe.
terms mixing cardiovascular training resistance training, day,
different day, one come first, one come second? one main
goals, again, everyone listening different goals are, people like either
maintain gain muscle. don't know many people want lose muscle.
maintain gains muscle, usually specific locations body, people
like bit leaner lot leaner. people
either naturally lean don't want, actually just want gain weight. assuming
people want get leaner, put muscle, maintain muscle, want
healthy heart healthy brain, basically requires healthy cardiovascular


system, incorporate cardiovascular work overall weekly
regimen? - again, think bare minimum probably twice week terms
cardiovascular. want semblance cardiovascular conditioning.
think people actually need want pursue
going need time that. point can't just relegated day
off, day off weight training workouts. point occur
day. case, just like put it, is, not primary goal,
looking the, just overall picture, aesthetics mentioned, putting
muscle certain areas, put end workout. 'Cause
don't want way compromise weight training work out. sort
referenced couple times already, intensity workouts important.
know strength component workouts also going helpful
stimulus growth. conditioning, cardio, stuff done prior training,
strength training, workout, likely going impair ability perform best.
unless just done quick little warmup beginning, not sustained
long enough really benefit cardiovascular conditioning. just like put
end, realizing even effort level lower, output lower, still
placing demand cardiac output get conditioning effect
fatigued, still demand cardiac output, still achieving goal,
didn't interfere main goal able increase performance gym. -
Got it. terms form cardiovascular training, seen number of,
say impressive high intensity interval type work. burpee type work,
pushups crunches mixed them, anyway, people can see videos, didn't
describe best way, rather treadmill jogging 30-45
minutes, prefer higher intensity, higher heart rate type training,
live cold Connecticut, don't want jogging
roads middle winter? - think above, mean, factors
personal level, think are- blend function across realms
not delineation between, way training,
conditioning, figure way blend together, always think got
better opportunity get well rounded result. like kind mix
straight conditioning work also footwork drills. high
expectations guys come programs, like just footwork drills. -
Like ladders. - Like ladders, line drills something. know happens?


People become intrigued interested. Like never, haven't tried since high
school. become interested just challenge it, become
almost distracted challenge, now like finding conditioning.
always think important part, sometimes got draw people show
might interested in. output effect it, just think
able blend some, still maintain strength training
exercise, mentioned, say kind push burpee,
anaerobic component going helpful, rather
just walking just jogging. Not say isn't effective means strict cardiac
conditioning, one ways centuries, it. just
think can blend it, becomes maybe little bit interesting
get crossover benefits, doesn't become segmented terms
trying do. - love idea bringing mental challenge
desire improve skill conditioning. not something thought
before, simply 'cause overlooked it, makes sense because, sister
reasonably fit, although always trying get bit more, always
asks me, take? a, don't believe supplements certain
people certain instances, keep telling her, know, it's, behaviors going
end, nutrition going greatest outsize positive effect. loves
things like dance classes things, kickboxing, kinds things which,
makes sense can hook somebody conditioning aspect skill
aspect kind trick cardio, speak terrific. Also
neuroscientist just say, forgive me, anytime engaging two
sets motor neurons, ones brain, upper motor neurons ones
spinal cord, anytime engaging upper motor neurons,
deliberate well controlled action, great thing brain

00:28:24 Tool: Mind-Muscle Connection, Cavaliere Cramp Contraction Test

terms brain longevity. So, now need incorporate actual skills
training. Going back weight training bit, one important things learned
you, years that, training increase muscle size, really
think, not much moving weights, challenging muscles. - Yeah. -
also heard friend, Ben Pakulski, well accomplished,


bodybuilder, now aspects fitness, teaches fitness, don't move
weights challenge muscles, unless trying power lift something sort,
not, immensely helpful. thing learned that,
combined idea certain muscles will grow better get stronger
much easily, maybe even will recover better ability contract
really hard. call Cavaliere test, least paraphrase,
instance, can, always bicep, isn't it? use calf bicep.
can flex bicep point hurts little bit, like almost feels like
cramp cramp, can flex calf point really cramps
little bit, almost feels like nodding up, pretty good indication going
able stimulate muscle well load movement
properly. feeling actually aim repetition, maybe even
throughout repetition. me, completely transformed results. was,
think maybe five/six years ago first heard you, body parts me,
lagged behind, thought maybe genetically weren't going work me,
immediately just started growing, right? getting stronger stronger,
thought really something much dedicated portion research
along with, collaboration another group try understand happening
upper motor neurons brain can engage muscles even more.
not just progressive overload putting pump muscle.
really mind muscle connection real thing comes predicting results
can get better it. forgive paraphrasing incredible content
around this, made tremendous difference number people
passed along to. can you, first all, arrive that?
hear mind-muscle connection, really heard first you.
arrive kind cramp test, Cavaliere test call it? always
weird people name things science, scientists can
name things. now officially Cavaliere test, whether not can
cramp muscle absence load, just flexing point hurts little
bit. good indication grow muscle well.
come this? - mean, honestly, something made sense me,
workouts, even young kid just starting out, always wanted know
working? lot people ask question think, like,
supposed work? lot, don't know ever noticed, like people


ask question, trained trainer, trainer's saying, well, just
this, exercise show it. say,
supposed work? supposed feel this, right? People, just
inherently ask question? lot people will. one that,
asked question. Not knew doing, just don't
know, wanted know supposed work. that,
start seek out, say, okay, well, bicep supposed
work, want make sure bicep's work. just sort
really like tweak movement make work feel uncomfortable,
get stronger contraction, knowing supposed job, wasn't PT
school learning, oh, well, flexion elbow brachial bias
bias' responsible supination. started to, learned components it,
wanted know bring arm curl, supposed job?
seek ways make happen better. able that,
feel stronger contraction. just, don't know it, just, no
visionary, just felt like knew going better muscle
trying grow stressed effectively. attempting
across different exercises, notice potentially curl
arm up, asking flex bicep position, couldn't
concentration curl, couldn't carry cable curl, shouldn't
really change, 'cause function still largely same, still elbow flexion,
still supination, not able there? sort clued
like, mind-muscle connection not just mind one muscle,
every exercise matters, varies exercise exercise. even
don't gain muscle size that, although think hard not to, especially
not used that, term like call muscularity,
difference, right? level sort resting tone muscle. improves
dramatically. can learn just start engage muscle better,
muscularity, resting tone muscle harder, attention,
alive. driven able connect better neurologically muscle
trying train. talked lot efficiency really trying
seek movements trying create hypertrophy. strength
goal, efficiency movement looking for. looking
muscles tied together work well efficiently, chest, shoulders, triceps,


get bar off chest bench press. not looking make
inefficient leverages chest, try grow chest bench press,
trying let whole package come together greater output.
trying go create muscle hypertrophy even muscularity talk about,
need seek ways make feel uncomfortable. don't feel discomfort,
something wrong. struggle day certain muscle groups
still that, even knowing trying work knowing goal
everything preaching here. difficult muscles certain people
certain muscles. mentioned, practice help.
become consistent

00:35:05 “Muscularity” & Resting Tone

deliberate trying do, result actually get. -
couple really couple points like delve further. First all, hunch
always muscle groups grew easily contract hardest
without any- first time Cavaliere test, got 10 10. give 10
10 scale. just like cinch, isolate muscles, cinch them, grow easily.
mean, certain body parts, don't want say ones, 'cause doesn't really
matter, always felt like just pushups, grow, muscles
far away muscles supposed involved pushups, even
though like think pushups correctly. tell not.
think genetic, sports played
younger. swam, played soccer, skateboard. later boxed.
muscles involved sports always easy engage later went
gym. guess perhaps call parents, kids lot dynamic activity,
seems like might good idea. thing issue muscularity.
glad brought up. are, imagine large number listeners
don't want get bigger. don't want take larger clothing size. don't
want take space. fact, like take less space,
want quality describing, that, oftentimes hear
the, stereotyping bit, kindness. hear women haven't
weight trained, say, don't want get big, often. Sometimes do,
women helped weight train talked weight train say, don't want


get big, want get toned. think referring quality
muscularity. - hundred percent, - idea resting close rest, anytime
someone reaches grabs glass, muscles almost look like kind
twitching underneath skin. yet Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.
thing muscularity, resting tone, physiological basis, think readily
nerves communicating muscles. saying learning
engage muscles actively, resting tone muscularity can improve.
seen men women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - think
something takes upkeep, maintenance, develop muscle,
can just kind let coast. - think like everything key, requires upkeep,
know, user lose it, believe firmly, like think development
connections going harder maintenance connection. said,
still struggle day unnamed muscle groups, also,-
just certain areas harder brain whatever reason just develop
connection type level create extra strong contraction. think
proper dedication focus, go right say, calves one
areas don't necessarily great connection with, also obviously must not
care much 'cause don't put time effort create connection could.
think might happen is, know yeah, struggle there,
struggle comes disinterest, 'cause like, well screw it, calf knot
not going anything it. think put required effort in,
time repetitions will develop that, develop it, going
stick around lot longer not invested time all, not
requiring much that. mean, don't know, like mentioned, now
train, like, just, just part train now, like going hard,
trying really forcefully contract. not just moving weight, say
point point B, like trying contract weight range.
mindset try put everything doing, unless course focused
strength exercise just trying lift greater amount use muscles
together. goal inefficiency hypertrophy, really trying create
contraction, just part training. guess consistency's sake,
long training happening. get away training not happening
all, know, even there, probably another embarrassing admission probably, will
mindfully throughout day, even no weight hand, certain muscle


groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect

30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

00:08:38 Tool: Fitness Plan General Health

enter code Huberman checkout. now discussion Jeff
Cavaliere. Jeff, pleasure here. - glad here,
amazing. - longtime consumer content. learned tremendous amount
fitness, weight room cardio, nutrition things applied
decade. me, particularly meaningful. goal really
ask bunch questions interested answers, also
know audience really curious about. one mantras is, "If want look
like athlete, train like athlete" think something really special sets
aside lot well qualified people do. terms
use weights resistance, whether not body weight weights gym,
pulleys versus cardio, terms overall health aesthetics athleticism,
way point idea maybe people 50% resistance
training 50% cardio, maybe 70/30, maybe 30/70. talking
typical person like maintain, maybe even add muscle mass,
probably particular areas people, opposed just overall mass. Although
talk later, people want maintain relatively low body fat
percentage good cardiovascular health. sort contour basic
program anybody think starting place? - think like 60/40 split,
leaning towards weight training, strength conditioning
aspect 40%. look course training week, mean, five
days gym great task. obviously not gym, done
home. three days strength training, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Conditioning,


Tuesday, Thursday, know, two days. pretty easy roundabout way split
up, course, depending upon training goals. said, aesthetic goals like
will shift dramatically. want see benefits both, probably
effect dose strength training effect dose conditioning bare
minimum level. Again, much better performer conditioning wise, going
want that. - terms duration workouts,
suggestion? weight training 30 years, running 30 years,
mainly health. found work hard gym resistance training
60 minutes so, hard recover, start getting cold, start
getting weaker workout workout, amazingly, least me, keep
workouts 10 minutes warmup 55 minutes really hard work
resistance training, keep cardiovascular work 30 45 minutes, feel
great. seem make progress, least someplace workout
workout workout. - Yeah, mean, good numbers, 'cause kind
numbers usually preach. try keep workouts hour less
possible. Now, depending upon split following, total body
split, just going done given amount time.
training primarily strength, prolong workout, 'cause
longer rest time sets. general, not focused
one aspect, overall health picture, can get job done
hour. again, always say, top "If want look like athlete train, like
athlete," is, "You either train longer train hard, can't both."
really believe focus me, busy life, lot things
believe not. like, want go hard want go get out.
find body also responds that, think lot guys' body respond that.
particularly start get older, think length workout actually
causes problems intensity doing. Particularly
warmed properly like said. found personally warmup
become integral part workout ever before. get
gym 20, going right over, one set, two sets, ready
go. know, never another workout warmup set
exercise rest day. not true anymore. found long
willing sort give little bit warmup, intensity not bothers me.
much control weights use doesn't bother me. start


go pretty long, start feel achy start problems. again, depending upon
age, also plays factor length. again, think everybody can achieve,

00:13:27 Tool: Optimizing Body Part Training Splits

standard program, can achieve results want within hour. - terms
splits, mentioned splits. aren't familiar term splits,
really body parts training on? days? Seems like almost
everybody follows weekly workout schedule. Although body course doesn't care
week. no reason thing every seven days twice every
seven days makes sense physiologically, just body doesn't work that. But,
way life structured. seen discuss three days week, whole body
workouts. heard splits like pushing one day, pulling another day, legs another
day, day off, repeat. mean, many variations this.
general themes can throw there? order avoid huge matrix
possibilities, wonderful content points those. will cap-
caption show notes, link different ways design splits.
terms giving people logic think splitting body parts,
governing split? rules logic dictate split? - me,
first rule will stick it? Like you, 'cause split, don't particularly like full
body splits. actually talking Jesse day like, don't
necessarily like train everything. Now course volumes will come
per muscle group. don't like that, actually don't look forward
workout dreading everything feeling maybe
fatigued time workout's over, fact generally take little
bit longer don't fit schedule. don't care effective split is, split not
done not effective. need find one fits. maybe go
alternative option, like push-pull-legs, like mentioned. done
either one cycle week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday split,
twice week. actually training six times, repeat it, pull-push-legs,
pull-push-legs, however want either day off three
days, end six days. again, actually impacts schedule.
broken it's, put three days, good
giving extra rest day between, starts shift day


off every week wrap around. guys choosing seven day
schedule convenience heads, starts mess off day. others
like just keep predictably, say Sunday, train six days row.
better way maybe group similar muscle actions together, think,
definitely prefer that, going training pulling movements, least
synergy them. feel like looking achieve one goal day.
then, mean, quite honestly, can go back bro-split days, still
work effectively. reason worked past. think science
shows smarter ways days. Like can come back hit
related muscle, do, say biceps one day come back two
days later back, realizing again, synergy exercises there,
biceps going get re-stimulated again. figure ways make
work, thing think effective there, tends one ones
people like most. can go in, get pump, feel good.
pretty solely focused one muscle group. - definition bro-split? One... -
One muscle group day? - Yeah, see, much geared towards strength
aesthetics really maximizing... - Probably aesthetics strength, yeah.
just... - Hence bro, bro name. - again, like, know, science
guy appreciate benefits bro-split. Especially 'cause again, like
end? goal trying achieve here? ours. Like applying
standards goals even like athletic ideals, just want get
shape, perfectly fine bro split instance, sticking
seeing results want see it. able really keep
focus one muscle, get focus on. Look, lot times people struggle
way exercise feels second third set. Like don't
proper percept ability kind lock exercise. spending few, not
sets exercise, another exercise muscle group
helps dial little bit better get training. - Yeah,
raised really interesting, think important question. Early started resistance
training, 16 high school, got touch learning
Mike Menzer. - too, crazy. - Mike helpful. Very, helpful.
got friendly... - So, just read book, didn't get chance him,
jealous, right? - Well, back no internet, paid Western Union type thing send
money - back magazine. - got phone


mother time like, grown man calling house?
gave straightforward split, shoulders, arms one day,
taking two days off training legs two days off chest
back, et cetera. - variation bro-split too. sort breaking
way, chest back chest bis, know? - worked
well me, probably would've, age think,
untrained, think, largely untrained, think would've grown many different programs,
worked well me. eventually just made every day thing.
Shoulders arms day off, legs day two off, 'cause hit legs right, least
me, not training next day. not much anything athletic
next day, chest, back repeat on. reason found helpful
almost always recovered workouts. six day week program push-pull-
legs, push-pull-legs, seems excruciating two standpoints. One is, least
recovery abilities, lack recovery abilities, can't imagine coming back
feeling fresh. one is, gym four days week, really
start fatigue whole psychological experience it. Whereas
three four days week. words, put day off workout,
really want there. get lot fire. also things
off days. think that, love mentioned split stick to.
can bring intensity to, think really important.
sometimes hear two day training. done two day training twice
lifetime,

00:20:12 Two-a-Day Training

times got sick two days later. correlation, not causation. ever
instance two day weight training makes sense non-drug assisted, typical
recovery ability person? - Actually, think makes sense scenarios,
doesn't make sense practically lot people's schedules. like break
down, say going even version total body session,
maybe like going upper lower split, right? upper workout
anterior chain pushing portion one session come
back pulling session later night, opportunity to. thing
benefit freshness focus. Again, like something head


sacrificed time get towards latter half whatever workout in.
point made like, start approach 50 minutes
hour mark, either losing focus, losing energy, losing contract
viability, losing something. relegating whatever is, pulling
portion end workout, something suffers that, realize
happening, maybe switch next time workout
pulling portion upper workout goes first, pushing goes
later, least not just continuing cycle, time,
able kind split up, get chance kind take break,
freshness focus again, actually get better effort in, 'cause again,
think effort drives results. effort not compromised,
able that. systemically problem? think problem
lot people. just hard to, hard rev engine lot times day.
warm thing once, like car winter, get going once,
lucky, okay, now got drive rest day. put garage
try start next day, problem. So, know, young people can get away
lot older people could. - Well, never strong recovery quotient,
stick one day off between, every while, two days row
training, maybe travel want make sure get workouts
kind thing, seem okay. like example warming car, spoken
like true east coaster, us west coast, took moment there,

00:22:33 Cardiovascular Conditioning, High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) & Skills

folks East Coast Midwest, get it, certainly Europe.
terms mixing cardiovascular training resistance training, day,
different day, one come first, one come second? one main
goals, again, everyone listening different goals are, people like either
maintain gain muscle. don't know many people want lose muscle.
maintain gains muscle, usually specific locations body, people
like bit leaner lot leaner. people
either naturally lean don't want, actually just want gain weight. assuming
people want get leaner, put muscle, maintain muscle, want
healthy heart healthy brain, basically requires healthy cardiovascular


system, incorporate cardiovascular work overall weekly
regimen? - again, think bare minimum probably twice week terms
cardiovascular. want semblance cardiovascular conditioning.
think people actually need want pursue
going need time that. point can't just relegated day
off, day off weight training workouts. point occur
day. case, just like put it, is, not primary goal,
looking the, just overall picture, aesthetics mentioned, putting
muscle certain areas, put end workout. 'Cause
don't want way compromise weight training work out. sort
referenced couple times already, intensity workouts important.
know strength component workouts also going helpful
stimulus growth. conditioning, cardio, stuff done prior training,
strength training, workout, likely going impair ability perform best.
unless just done quick little warmup beginning, not sustained
long enough really benefit cardiovascular conditioning. just like put
end, realizing even effort level lower, output lower, still
placing demand cardiac output get conditioning effect
fatigued, still demand cardiac output, still achieving goal,
didn't interfere main goal able increase performance gym. -
Got it. terms form cardiovascular training, seen number of,
say impressive high intensity interval type work. burpee type work,
pushups crunches mixed them, anyway, people can see videos, didn't
describe best way, rather treadmill jogging 30-45
minutes, prefer higher intensity, higher heart rate type training,
live cold Connecticut, don't want jogging
roads middle winter? - think above, mean, factors
personal level, think are- blend function across realms
not delineation between, way training,
conditioning, figure way blend together, always think got
better opportunity get well rounded result. like kind mix
straight conditioning work also footwork drills. high
expectations guys come programs, like just footwork drills. -
Like ladders. - Like ladders, line drills something. know happens?


People become intrigued interested. Like never, haven't tried since high
school. become interested just challenge it, become
almost distracted challenge, now like finding conditioning.
always think important part, sometimes got draw people show
might interested in. output effect it, just think
able blend some, still maintain strength training
exercise, mentioned, say kind push burpee,
anaerobic component going helpful, rather
just walking just jogging. Not say isn't effective means strict cardiac
conditioning, one ways centuries, it. just
think can blend it, becomes maybe little bit interesting
get crossover benefits, doesn't become segmented terms
trying do. - love idea bringing mental challenge
desire improve skill conditioning. not something thought
before, simply 'cause overlooked it, makes sense because, sister
reasonably fit, although always trying get bit more, always
asks me, take? a, don't believe supplements certain
people certain instances, keep telling her, know, it's, behaviors going
end, nutrition going greatest outsize positive effect. loves
things like dance classes things, kickboxing, kinds things which,
makes sense can hook somebody conditioning aspect skill
aspect kind trick cardio, speak terrific. Also
neuroscientist just say, forgive me, anytime engaging two
sets motor neurons, ones brain, upper motor neurons ones
spinal cord, anytime engaging upper motor neurons,
deliberate well controlled action, great thing brain

00:28:24 Tool: Mind-Muscle Connection, Cavaliere Cramp Contraction Test

terms brain longevity. So, now need incorporate actual skills
training. Going back weight training bit, one important things learned
you, years that, training increase muscle size, really
think, not much moving weights, challenging muscles. - Yeah. -
also heard friend, Ben Pakulski, well accomplished,


bodybuilder, now aspects fitness, teaches fitness, don't move
weights challenge muscles, unless trying power lift something sort,
not, immensely helpful. thing learned that,
combined idea certain muscles will grow better get stronger
much easily, maybe even will recover better ability contract
really hard. call Cavaliere test, least paraphrase,
instance, can, always bicep, isn't it? use calf bicep.
can flex bicep point hurts little bit, like almost feels like
cramp cramp, can flex calf point really cramps
little bit, almost feels like nodding up, pretty good indication going
able stimulate muscle well load movement
properly. feeling actually aim repetition, maybe even
throughout repetition. me, completely transformed results. was,
think maybe five/six years ago first heard you, body parts me,
lagged behind, thought maybe genetically weren't going work me,
immediately just started growing, right? getting stronger stronger,
thought really something much dedicated portion research
along with, collaboration another group try understand happening
upper motor neurons brain can engage muscles even more.
not just progressive overload putting pump muscle.
really mind muscle connection real thing comes predicting results
can get better it. forgive paraphrasing incredible content
around this, made tremendous difference number people
passed along to. can you, first all, arrive that?
hear mind-muscle connection, really heard first you.
arrive kind cramp test, Cavaliere test call it? always
weird people name things science, scientists can
name things. now officially Cavaliere test, whether not can
cramp muscle absence load, just flexing point hurts little
bit. good indication grow muscle well.
come this? - mean, honestly, something made sense me,
workouts, even young kid just starting out, always wanted know
working? lot people ask question think, like,
supposed work? lot, don't know ever noticed, like people


ask question, trained trainer, trainer's saying, well, just
this, exercise show it. say,
supposed work? supposed feel this, right? People, just
inherently ask question? lot people will. one that,
asked question. Not knew doing, just don't
know, wanted know supposed work. that,
start seek out, say, okay, well, bicep supposed
work, want make sure bicep's work. just sort
really like tweak movement make work feel uncomfortable,
get stronger contraction, knowing supposed job, wasn't PT
school learning, oh, well, flexion elbow brachial bias
bias' responsible supination. started to, learned components it,
wanted know bring arm curl, supposed job?
seek ways make happen better. able that,
feel stronger contraction. just, don't know it, just, no
visionary, just felt like knew going better muscle
trying grow stressed effectively. attempting
across different exercises, notice potentially curl
arm up, asking flex bicep position, couldn't
concentration curl, couldn't carry cable curl, shouldn't
really change, 'cause function still largely same, still elbow flexion,
still supination, not able there? sort clued
like, mind-muscle connection not just mind one muscle,
every exercise matters, varies exercise exercise. even
don't gain muscle size that, although think hard not to, especially
not used that, term like call muscularity,
difference, right? level sort resting tone muscle. improves
dramatically. can learn just start engage muscle better,
muscularity, resting tone muscle harder, attention,
alive. driven able connect better neurologically muscle
trying train. talked lot efficiency really trying
seek movements trying create hypertrophy. strength
goal, efficiency movement looking for. looking
muscles tied together work well efficiently, chest, shoulders, triceps,


get bar off chest bench press. not looking make
inefficient leverages chest, try grow chest bench press,
trying let whole package come together greater output.
trying go create muscle hypertrophy even muscularity talk about,
need seek ways make feel uncomfortable. don't feel discomfort,
something wrong. struggle day certain muscle groups
still that, even knowing trying work knowing goal
everything preaching here. difficult muscles certain people
certain muscles. mentioned, practice help.
become consistent

00:35:05 “Muscularity” & Resting Tone

deliberate trying do, result actually get. -
couple really couple points like delve further. First all, hunch
always muscle groups grew easily contract hardest
without any- first time Cavaliere test, got 10 10. give 10
10 scale. just like cinch, isolate muscles, cinch them, grow easily.
mean, certain body parts, don't want say ones, 'cause doesn't really
matter, always felt like just pushups, grow, muscles
far away muscles supposed involved pushups, even
though like think pushups correctly. tell not.
think genetic, sports played
younger. swam, played soccer, skateboard. later boxed.
muscles involved sports always easy engage later went
gym. guess perhaps call parents, kids lot dynamic activity,
seems like might good idea. thing issue muscularity.
glad brought up. are, imagine large number listeners
don't want get bigger. don't want take larger clothing size. don't
want take space. fact, like take less space,
want quality describing, that, oftentimes hear
the, stereotyping bit, kindness. hear women haven't
weight trained, say, don't want get big, often. Sometimes do,
women helped weight train talked weight train say, don't want


get big, want get toned. think referring quality
muscularity. - hundred percent, - idea resting close rest, anytime
someone reaches grabs glass, muscles almost look like kind
twitching underneath skin. yet Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.
thing muscularity, resting tone, physiological basis, think readily
nerves communicating muscles. saying learning
engage muscles actively, resting tone muscularity can improve.
seen men women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - think
something takes upkeep, maintenance, develop muscle,
can just kind let coast. - think like everything key, requires upkeep,
know, user lose it, believe firmly, like think development
connections going harder maintenance connection. said,
still struggle day unnamed muscle groups, also,-
just certain areas harder brain whatever reason just develop
connection type level create extra strong contraction. think
proper dedication focus, go right say, calves one
areas don't necessarily great connection with, also obviously must not
care much 'cause don't put time effort create connection could.
think might happen is, know yeah, struggle there,
struggle comes disinterest, 'cause like, well screw it, calf knot
not going anything it. think put required effort in,
time repetitions will develop that, develop it, going
stick around lot longer not invested time all, not
requiring much that. mean, don't know, like mentioned, now
train, like, just, just part train now, like going hard,
trying really forcefully contract. not just moving weight, say
point point B, like trying contract weight range.
mindset try put everything doing, unless course focused
strength exercise just trying lift greater amount use muscles
together. goal inefficiency hypertrophy, really trying create
contraction, just part training. guess consistency's sake,
long training happening. get away training not happening
all, know, even there, probably another embarrassing admission probably, will
mindfully throughout day, even no weight hand, certain muscle


groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

decade. me, particularly meaningful. goal really
ask bunch questions interested answers, also
know audience really curious about. one mantras is, "If want look
like athlete, train like athlete" think something really special sets
aside lot well qualified people do. terms
use weights resistance, whether not body weight weights gym,
pulleys versus cardio, terms overall health aesthetics athleticism,
way point idea maybe people 50% resistance
training 50% cardio, maybe 70/30, maybe 30/70. talking
typical person like maintain, maybe even add muscle mass,
probably particular areas people, opposed just overall mass. Although
talk later, people want maintain relatively low body fat
percentage good cardiovascular health. sort contour basic
program anybody think starting place? - think like 60/40 split,
leaning towards weight training, strength conditioning
aspect 40%. look course training week, mean, five
days gym great task. obviously not gym, done
home. three days strength training, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Conditioning,


Tuesday, Thursday, know, two days. pretty easy roundabout way split
up, course, depending upon training goals. said, aesthetic goals like
will shift dramatically. want see benefits both, probably
effect dose strength training effect dose conditioning bare
minimum level. Again, much better performer conditioning wise, going
want that. - terms duration workouts,
suggestion? weight training 30 years, running 30 years,
mainly health. found work hard gym resistance training
60 minutes so, hard recover, start getting cold, start
getting weaker workout workout, amazingly, least me, keep
workouts 10 minutes warmup 55 minutes really hard work
resistance training, keep cardiovascular work 30 45 minutes, feel
great. seem make progress, least someplace workout
workout workout. - Yeah, mean, good numbers, 'cause kind
numbers usually preach. try keep workouts hour less
possible. Now, depending upon split following, total body
split, just going done given amount time.
training primarily strength, prolong workout, 'cause
longer rest time sets. general, not focused
one aspect, overall health picture, can get job done
hour. again, always say, top "If want look like athlete train, like
athlete," is, "You either train longer train hard, can't both."
really believe focus me, busy life, lot things
believe not. like, want go hard want go get out.
find body also responds that, think lot guys' body respond that.
particularly start get older, think length workout actually
causes problems intensity doing. Particularly
warmed properly like said. found personally warmup
become integral part workout ever before. get
gym 20, going right over, one set, two sets, ready
go. know, never another workout warmup set
exercise rest day. not true anymore. found long
willing sort give little bit warmup, intensity not bothers me.
much control weights use doesn't bother me. start


go pretty long, start feel achy start problems. again, depending upon
age, also plays factor length. again, think everybody can achieve,

00:13:27 Tool: Optimizing Body Part Training Splits

standard program, can achieve results want within hour. - terms
splits, mentioned splits. aren't familiar term splits,
really body parts training on? days? Seems like almost
everybody follows weekly workout schedule. Although body course doesn't care
week. no reason thing every seven days twice every
seven days makes sense physiologically, just body doesn't work that. But,
way life structured. seen discuss three days week, whole body
workouts. heard splits like pushing one day, pulling another day, legs another
day, day off, repeat. mean, many variations this.
general themes can throw there? order avoid huge matrix
possibilities, wonderful content points those. will cap-
caption show notes, link different ways design splits.
terms giving people logic think splitting body parts,
governing split? rules logic dictate split? - me,
first rule will stick it? Like you, 'cause split, don't particularly like full
body splits. actually talking Jesse day like, don't
necessarily like train everything. Now course volumes will come
per muscle group. don't like that, actually don't look forward
workout dreading everything feeling maybe
fatigued time workout's over, fact generally take little
bit longer don't fit schedule. don't care effective split is, split not
done not effective. need find one fits. maybe go
alternative option, like push-pull-legs, like mentioned. done
either one cycle week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday split,
twice week. actually training six times, repeat it, pull-push-legs,
pull-push-legs, however want either day off three
days, end six days. again, actually impacts schedule.
broken it's, put three days, good
giving extra rest day between, starts shift day


off every week wrap around. guys choosing seven day
schedule convenience heads, starts mess off day. others
like just keep predictably, say Sunday, train six days row.
better way maybe group similar muscle actions together, think,
definitely prefer that, going training pulling movements, least
synergy them. feel like looking achieve one goal day.
then, mean, quite honestly, can go back bro-split days, still
work effectively. reason worked past. think science
shows smarter ways days. Like can come back hit
related muscle, do, say biceps one day come back two
days later back, realizing again, synergy exercises there,
biceps going get re-stimulated again. figure ways make
work, thing think effective there, tends one ones
people like most. can go in, get pump, feel good.
pretty solely focused one muscle group. - definition bro-split? One... -
One muscle group day? - Yeah, see, much geared towards strength
aesthetics really maximizing... - Probably aesthetics strength, yeah.
just... - Hence bro, bro name. - again, like, know, science
guy appreciate benefits bro-split. Especially 'cause again, like
end? goal trying achieve here? ours. Like applying
standards goals even like athletic ideals, just want get
shape, perfectly fine bro split instance, sticking
seeing results want see it. able really keep
focus one muscle, get focus on. Look, lot times people struggle
way exercise feels second third set. Like don't
proper percept ability kind lock exercise. spending few, not
sets exercise, another exercise muscle group
helps dial little bit better get training. - Yeah,
raised really interesting, think important question. Early started resistance
training, 16 high school, got touch learning
Mike Menzer. - too, crazy. - Mike helpful. Very, helpful.
got friendly... - So, just read book, didn't get chance him,
jealous, right? - Well, back no internet, paid Western Union type thing send
money - back magazine. - got phone


mother time like, grown man calling house?
gave straightforward split, shoulders, arms one day,
taking two days off training legs two days off chest
back, et cetera. - variation bro-split too. sort breaking
way, chest back chest bis, know? - worked
well me, probably would've, age think,
untrained, think, largely untrained, think would've grown many different programs,
worked well me. eventually just made every day thing.
Shoulders arms day off, legs day two off, 'cause hit legs right, least
me, not training next day. not much anything athletic
next day, chest, back repeat on. reason found helpful
almost always recovered workouts. six day week program push-pull-
legs, push-pull-legs, seems excruciating two standpoints. One is, least
recovery abilities, lack recovery abilities, can't imagine coming back
feeling fresh. one is, gym four days week, really
start fatigue whole psychological experience it. Whereas
three four days week. words, put day off workout,
really want there. get lot fire. also things
off days. think that, love mentioned split stick to.
can bring intensity to, think really important.
sometimes hear two day training. done two day training twice
lifetime,

00:20:12 Two-a-Day Training

times got sick two days later. correlation, not causation. ever
instance two day weight training makes sense non-drug assisted, typical
recovery ability person? - Actually, think makes sense scenarios,
doesn't make sense practically lot people's schedules. like break
down, say going even version total body session,
maybe like going upper lower split, right? upper workout
anterior chain pushing portion one session come
back pulling session later night, opportunity to. thing
benefit freshness focus. Again, like something head


sacrificed time get towards latter half whatever workout in.
point made like, start approach 50 minutes
hour mark, either losing focus, losing energy, losing contract
viability, losing something. relegating whatever is, pulling
portion end workout, something suffers that, realize
happening, maybe switch next time workout
pulling portion upper workout goes first, pushing goes
later, least not just continuing cycle, time,
able kind split up, get chance kind take break,
freshness focus again, actually get better effort in, 'cause again,
think effort drives results. effort not compromised,
able that. systemically problem? think problem
lot people. just hard to, hard rev engine lot times day.
warm thing once, like car winter, get going once,
lucky, okay, now got drive rest day. put garage
try start next day, problem. So, know, young people can get away
lot older people could. - Well, never strong recovery quotient,
stick one day off between, every while, two days row
training, maybe travel want make sure get workouts
kind thing, seem okay. like example warming car, spoken
like true east coaster, us west coast, took moment there,

00:22:33 Cardiovascular Conditioning, High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) & Skills

folks East Coast Midwest, get it, certainly Europe.
terms mixing cardiovascular training resistance training, day,
different day, one come first, one come second? one main
goals, again, everyone listening different goals are, people like either
maintain gain muscle. don't know many people want lose muscle.
maintain gains muscle, usually specific locations body, people
like bit leaner lot leaner. people
either naturally lean don't want, actually just want gain weight. assuming
people want get leaner, put muscle, maintain muscle, want
healthy heart healthy brain, basically requires healthy cardiovascular


system, incorporate cardiovascular work overall weekly
regimen? - again, think bare minimum probably twice week terms
cardiovascular. want semblance cardiovascular conditioning.
think people actually need want pursue
going need time that. point can't just relegated day
off, day off weight training workouts. point occur
day. case, just like put it, is, not primary goal,
looking the, just overall picture, aesthetics mentioned, putting
muscle certain areas, put end workout. 'Cause
don't want way compromise weight training work out. sort
referenced couple times already, intensity workouts important.
know strength component workouts also going helpful
stimulus growth. conditioning, cardio, stuff done prior training,
strength training, workout, likely going impair ability perform best.
unless just done quick little warmup beginning, not sustained
long enough really benefit cardiovascular conditioning. just like put
end, realizing even effort level lower, output lower, still
placing demand cardiac output get conditioning effect
fatigued, still demand cardiac output, still achieving goal,
didn't interfere main goal able increase performance gym. -
Got it. terms form cardiovascular training, seen number of,
say impressive high intensity interval type work. burpee type work,
pushups crunches mixed them, anyway, people can see videos, didn't
describe best way, rather treadmill jogging 30-45
minutes, prefer higher intensity, higher heart rate type training,
live cold Connecticut, don't want jogging
roads middle winter? - think above, mean, factors
personal level, think are- blend function across realms
not delineation between, way training,
conditioning, figure way blend together, always think got
better opportunity get well rounded result. like kind mix
straight conditioning work also footwork drills. high
expectations guys come programs, like just footwork drills. -
Like ladders. - Like ladders, line drills something. know happens?


People become intrigued interested. Like never, haven't tried since high
school. become interested just challenge it, become
almost distracted challenge, now like finding conditioning.
always think important part, sometimes got draw people show
might interested in. output effect it, just think
able blend some, still maintain strength training
exercise, mentioned, say kind push burpee,
anaerobic component going helpful, rather
just walking just jogging. Not say isn't effective means strict cardiac
conditioning, one ways centuries, it. just
think can blend it, becomes maybe little bit interesting
get crossover benefits, doesn't become segmented terms
trying do. - love idea bringing mental challenge
desire improve skill conditioning. not something thought
before, simply 'cause overlooked it, makes sense because, sister
reasonably fit, although always trying get bit more, always
asks me, take? a, don't believe supplements certain
people certain instances, keep telling her, know, it's, behaviors going
end, nutrition going greatest outsize positive effect. loves

deliberate well controlled action, great thing brain

00:28:24 Tool: Mind-Muscle Connection, Cavaliere Cramp Contraction Test

terms brain longevity. So, now need incorporate actual skills
training. Going back weight training bit, one important things learned
you, years that, training increase muscle size, really
think, not much moving weights, challenging muscles. - Yeah. -
also heard friend, Ben Pakulski, well accomplished,


bodybuilder, now aspects fitness, teaches fitness, don't move
weights challenge muscles, unless trying power lift something sort,
not, immensely helpful. thing learned that,
combined idea certain muscles will grow better get stronger
much easily, maybe even will recover better ability contract
really hard. call Cavaliere test, least paraphrase,
instance, can, always bicep, isn't it? use calf bicep.
can flex bicep point hurts little bit, like almost feels like
cramp cramp, can flex calf point really cramps
little bit, almost feels like nodding up, pretty good indication going
able stimulate muscle well load movement
properly. feeling actually aim repetition, maybe even
throughout repetition. me, completely transformed results. was,
think maybe five/six years ago first heard you, body parts me,
lagged behind, thought maybe genetically weren't going work me,
immediately just started growing, right? getting stronger stronger,
thought really something much dedicated portion research
along with, collaboration another group try understand happening
upper motor neurons brain can engage muscles even more.
not just progressive overload putting pump muscle.
really mind muscle connection real thing comes predicting results
can get better it. forgive paraphrasing incredible content
around this, made tremendous difference number people
passed along to. can you, first all, arrive that?
hear mind-muscle connection, really heard first you.
arrive kind cramp test, Cavaliere test call it? always
weird people name things science, scientists can
name things. now officially Cavaliere test, whether not can
cramp muscle absence load, just flexing point hurts little
bit. good indication grow muscle well.
come this? - mean, honestly, something made sense me,
workouts, even young kid just starting out, always wanted know
working? lot people ask question think, like,
supposed work? lot, don't know ever noticed, like people


ask question, trained trainer, trainer's saying, well, just
this, exercise show it. say,
supposed work? supposed feel this, right? People, just
inherently ask question? lot people will. one that,
asked question. Not knew doing, just don't
know, wanted know supposed work. that,
start seek out, say, okay, well, bicep supposed
work, want make sure bicep's work. just sort
really like tweak movement make work feel uncomfortable,
get stronger contraction, knowing supposed job, wasn't PT
school learning, oh, well, flexion elbow brachial bias
bias' responsible supination. started to, learned components it,
wanted know bring arm curl, supposed job?
seek ways make happen better. able that,
feel stronger contraction. just, don't know it, just, no
visionary, just felt like knew going better muscle
trying grow stressed effectively. attempting
across different exercises, notice potentially curl
arm up, asking flex bicep position, couldn't
concentration curl, couldn't carry cable curl, shouldn't
really change, 'cause function still largely same, still elbow flexion,
still supination, not able there? sort clued
like, mind-muscle connection not just mind one muscle,
every exercise matters, varies exercise exercise. even
don't gain muscle size that, although think hard not to, especially
not used that, term like call muscularity,
difference, right? level sort resting tone muscle. improves
dramatically. can learn just start engage muscle better,
muscularity, resting tone muscle harder, attention,
alive. driven able connect better neurologically muscle

become consistent

00:35:05 “Muscularity” & Resting Tone

deliberate trying do, result actually get. -
couple really couple points like delve further. First all, hunch
always muscle groups grew easily contract hardest
without any- first time Cavaliere test, got 10 10. give 10
10 scale. just like cinch, isolate muscles, cinch them, grow easily.
mean, certain body parts, don't want say ones, 'cause doesn't really
matter, always felt like just pushups, grow, muscles
far away muscles supposed involved pushups, even
though like think pushups correctly. tell not.
think genetic, sports played
younger. swam, played soccer, skateboard. later boxed.
muscles involved sports always easy engage later went
gym. guess perhaps call parents, kids lot dynamic activity,
seems like might good idea. thing issue muscularity.
glad brought up. are, imagine large number listeners
don't want get bigger. don't want take larger clothing size. don't
want take space. fact, like take less space,
want quality describing, that, oftentimes hear
the, stereotyping bit, kindness. hear women haven't
weight trained, say, don't want get big, often. Sometimes do,
women helped weight train talked weight train say, don't want


get big, want get toned. think referring quality
muscularity. - hundred percent, - idea resting close rest, anytime
someone reaches grabs glass, muscles almost look like kind
twitching underneath skin. yet Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.
thing muscularity, resting tone, physiological basis, think readily
nerves communicating muscles. saying learning
engage muscles actively, resting tone muscularity can improve.
seen men women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - think
something takes upkeep, maintenance, develop muscle,
can just kind let coast. - think like everything key, requires upkeep,
know, user lose it, believe firmly, like think development
connections going harder maintenance connection. said,
still struggle day unnamed muscle groups, also,-
just certain areas harder brain whatever reason just develop
connection type level create extra strong contraction. think
proper dedication focus, go right say, calves one
areas don't necessarily great connection with, also obviously must not
care much 'cause don't put time effort create connection could.
think might happen is, know yeah, struggle there,
struggle comes disinterest, 'cause like, well screw it, calf knot
not going anything it. think put required effort in,
time repetitions will develop that, develop it, going
stick around lot longer not invested time all, not
requiring much that. mean, don't know, like mentioned, now
train, like, just, just part train now, like going hard,
trying really forcefully contract. not just moving weight, say
point point B, like trying contract weight range.
mindset try put everything doing, unless course focused
strength exercise just trying lift greater amount use muscles
together. goal inefficiency hypertrophy, really trying create
contraction, just part training. guess consistency's sake,
long training happening. get away training not happening
all, know, even there, probably another embarrassing admission probably, will
mindfully throughout day, even no weight hand, certain muscle


groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

Tuesday, Thursday, know, two days. pretty easy roundabout way split
up, course, depending upon training goals. said, aesthetic goals like
will shift dramatically. want see benefits both, probably
effect dose strength training effect dose conditioning bare
minimum level. Again, much better performer conditioning wise, going
want that. - terms duration workouts,
suggestion? weight training 30 years, running 30 years,
mainly health. found work hard gym resistance training
60 minutes so, hard recover, start getting cold, start
getting weaker workout workout, amazingly, least me, keep
workouts 10 minutes warmup 55 minutes really hard work
resistance training, keep cardiovascular work 30 45 minutes, feel
great. seem make progress, least someplace workout
workout workout. - Yeah, mean, good numbers, 'cause kind
numbers usually preach. try keep workouts hour less
possible. Now, depending upon split following, total body
split, just going done given amount time.
training primarily strength, prolong workout, 'cause
longer rest time sets. general, not focused
one aspect, overall health picture, can get job done
hour. again, always say, top "If want look like athlete train, like
athlete," is, "You either train longer train hard, can't both."
really believe focus me, busy life, lot things
believe not. like, want go hard want go get out.
find body also responds that, think lot guys' body respond that.
particularly start get older, think length workout actually
causes problems intensity doing. Particularly
warmed properly like said. found personally warmup
become integral part workout ever before. get
gym 20, going right over, one set, two sets, ready
go. know, never another workout warmup set
exercise rest day. not true anymore. found long
willing sort give little bit warmup, intensity not bothers me.
much control weights use doesn't bother me. start


go pretty long, start feel achy start problems. again, depending upon
age, also plays factor length. again, think everybody can achieve,

00:13:27 Tool: Optimizing Body Part Training Splits

standard program, can achieve results want within hour. - terms
splits, mentioned splits. aren't familiar term splits,
really body parts training on? days? Seems like almost
everybody follows weekly workout schedule. Although body course doesn't care
week. no reason thing every seven days twice every
seven days makes sense physiologically, just body doesn't work that. But,
way life structured. seen discuss three days week, whole body
workouts. heard splits like pushing one day, pulling another day, legs another
day, day off, repeat. mean, many variations this.
general themes can throw there? order avoid huge matrix
possibilities, wonderful content points those. will cap-
caption show notes, link different ways design splits.
terms giving people logic think splitting body parts,
governing split? rules logic dictate split? - me,
first rule will stick it? Like you, 'cause split, don't particularly like full
body splits. actually talking Jesse day like, don't
necessarily like train everything. Now course volumes will come
per muscle group. don't like that, actually don't look forward
workout dreading everything feeling maybe
fatigued time workout's over, fact generally take little
bit longer don't fit schedule. don't care effective split is, split not
done not effective. need find one fits. maybe go
alternative option, like push-pull-legs, like mentioned. done
either one cycle week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday split,
twice week. actually training six times, repeat it, pull-push-legs,
pull-push-legs, however want either day off three
days, end six days. again, actually impacts schedule.
broken it's, put three days, good
giving extra rest day between, starts shift day


off every week wrap around. guys choosing seven day
schedule convenience heads, starts mess off day. others
like just keep predictably, say Sunday, train six days row.
better way maybe group similar muscle actions together, think,
definitely prefer that, going training pulling movements, least
synergy them. feel like looking achieve one goal day.
then, mean, quite honestly, can go back bro-split days, still
work effectively. reason worked past. think science
shows smarter ways days. Like can come back hit
related muscle, do, say biceps one day come back two
days later back, realizing again, synergy exercises there,
biceps going get re-stimulated again. figure ways make
work, thing think effective there, tends one ones
people like most. can go in, get pump, feel good.
pretty solely focused one muscle group. - definition bro-split? One... -
One muscle group day? - Yeah, see, much geared towards strength
aesthetics really maximizing... - Probably aesthetics strength, yeah.
just... - Hence bro, bro name. - again, like, know, science
guy appreciate benefits bro-split. Especially 'cause again, like
end? goal trying achieve here? ours. Like applying
standards goals even like athletic ideals, just want get
shape, perfectly fine bro split instance, sticking
seeing results want see it. able really keep
focus one muscle, get focus on. Look, lot times people struggle
way exercise feels second third set. Like don't
proper percept ability kind lock exercise. spending few, not
sets exercise, another exercise muscle group
helps dial little bit better get training. - Yeah,
raised really interesting, think important question. Early started resistance
training, 16 high school, got touch learning
Mike Menzer. - too, crazy. - Mike helpful. Very, helpful.
got friendly... - So, just read book, didn't get chance him,
jealous, right? - Well, back no internet, paid Western Union type thing send
money - back magazine. - got phone


mother time like, grown man calling house?
gave straightforward split, shoulders, arms one day,
taking two days off training legs two days off chest
back, et cetera. - variation bro-split too. sort breaking
way, chest back chest bis, know? - worked
well me, probably would've, age think,
untrained, think, largely untrained, think would've grown many different programs,
worked well me. eventually just made every day thing.
Shoulders arms day off, legs day two off, 'cause hit legs right, least
me, not training next day. not much anything athletic
next day, chest, back repeat on. reason found helpful
almost always recovered workouts. six day week program push-pull-
legs, push-pull-legs, seems excruciating two standpoints. One is, least
recovery abilities, lack recovery abilities, can't imagine coming back
feeling fresh. one is, gym four days week, really
start fatigue whole psychological experience it. Whereas
three four days week. words, put day off workout,
really want there. get lot fire. also things
off days. think that, love mentioned split stick to.
can bring intensity to, think really important.
sometimes hear two day training. done two day training twice
lifetime,

00:20:12 Two-a-Day Training

times got sick two days later. correlation, not causation. ever
instance two day weight training makes sense non-drug assisted, typical
recovery ability person? - Actually, think makes sense scenarios,
doesn't make sense practically lot people's schedules. like break
down, say going even version total body session,
maybe like going upper lower split, right? upper workout
anterior chain pushing portion one session come
back pulling session later night, opportunity to. thing
benefit freshness focus. Again, like something head


sacrificed time get towards latter half whatever workout in.
point made like, start approach 50 minutes
hour mark, either losing focus, losing energy, losing contract
viability, losing something. relegating whatever is, pulling
portion end workout, something suffers that, realize
happening, maybe switch next time workout
pulling portion upper workout goes first, pushing goes
later, least not just continuing cycle, time,
able kind split up, get chance kind take break,
freshness focus again, actually get better effort in, 'cause again,
think effort drives results. effort not compromised,
able that. systemically problem? think problem
lot people. just hard to, hard rev engine lot times day.
warm thing once, like car winter, get going once,
lucky, okay, now got drive rest day. put garage
try start next day, problem. So, know, young people can get away
lot older people could. - Well, never strong recovery quotient,
stick one day off between, every while, two days row
training, maybe travel want make sure get workouts
kind thing, seem okay. like example warming car, spoken
like true east coaster, us west coast, took moment there,

00:22:33 Cardiovascular Conditioning, High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) & Skills

folks East Coast Midwest, get it, certainly Europe.
terms mixing cardiovascular training resistance training, day,
different day, one come first, one come second? one main
goals, again, everyone listening different goals are, people like either
maintain gain muscle. don't know many people want lose muscle.
maintain gains muscle, usually specific locations body, people
like bit leaner lot leaner. people
either naturally lean don't want, actually just want gain weight. assuming
people want get leaner, put muscle, maintain muscle, want
healthy heart healthy brain, basically requires healthy cardiovascular


system, incorporate cardiovascular work overall weekly
regimen? - again, think bare minimum probably twice week terms
cardiovascular. want semblance cardiovascular conditioning.
think people actually need want pursue
going need time that. point can't just relegated day
off, day off weight training workouts. point occur
day. case, just like put it, is, not primary goal,
looking the, just overall picture, aesthetics mentioned, putting
muscle certain areas, put end workout. 'Cause
don't want way compromise weight training work out. sort
referenced couple times already, intensity workouts important.
know strength component workouts also going helpful
stimulus growth. conditioning, cardio, stuff done prior training,
strength training, workout, likely going impair ability perform best.
unless just done quick little warmup beginning, not sustained
long enough really benefit cardiovascular conditioning. just like put
end, realizing even effort level lower, output lower, still
placing demand cardiac output get conditioning effect
fatigued, still demand cardiac output, still achieving goal,
didn't interfere main goal able increase performance gym. -
Got it. terms form cardiovascular training, seen number of,
say impressive high intensity interval type work. burpee type work,
pushups crunches mixed them, anyway, people can see videos, didn't
describe best way, rather treadmill jogging 30-45
minutes, prefer higher intensity, higher heart rate type training,
live cold Connecticut, don't want jogging
roads middle winter? - think above, mean, factors
personal level, think are- blend function across realms
not delineation between, way training,
conditioning, figure way blend together, always think got
better opportunity get well rounded result. like kind mix
straight conditioning work also footwork drills. high
expectations guys come programs, like just footwork drills. -
Like ladders. - Like ladders, line drills something. know happens?


People become intrigued interested. Like never, haven't tried since high
school. become interested just challenge it, become
almost distracted challenge, now like finding conditioning.
always think important part, sometimes got draw people show
might interested in. output effect it, just think
able blend some, still maintain strength training
exercise, mentioned, say kind push burpee,
anaerobic component going helpful, rather
just walking just jogging. Not say isn't effective means strict cardiac
conditioning, one ways centuries, it. just
think can blend it, becomes maybe little bit interesting
get crossover benefits, doesn't become segmented terms
trying do. - love idea bringing mental challenge
desire improve skill conditioning. not something thought
before, simply 'cause overlooked it, makes sense because, sister
reasonably fit, although always trying get bit more, always
asks me, take? a, don't believe supplements certain
people certain instances, keep telling her, know, it's, behaviors going
end, nutrition going greatest outsize positive effect. loves
things like dance classes things, kickboxing, kinds things which,
makes sense can hook somebody conditioning aspect skill
aspect kind trick cardio, speak terrific. Also
neuroscientist just say, forgive me, anytime engaging two
sets motor neurons, ones brain, upper motor neurons ones
spinal cord, anytime engaging upper motor neurons,
deliberate well controlled action, great thing brain

00:28:24 Tool: Mind-Muscle Connection, Cavaliere Cramp Contraction Test

terms brain longevity. So, now need incorporate actual skills
training. Going back weight training bit, one important things learned
you, years that, training increase muscle size, really
think, not much moving weights, challenging muscles. - Yeah. -
also heard friend, Ben Pakulski, well accomplished,


bodybuilder, now aspects fitness, teaches fitness, don't move
weights challenge muscles, unless trying power lift something sort,
not, immensely helpful. thing learned that,
combined idea certain muscles will grow better get stronger
much easily, maybe even will recover better ability contract
really hard. call Cavaliere test, least paraphrase,
instance, can, always bicep, isn't it? use calf bicep.
can flex bicep point hurts little bit, like almost feels like
cramp cramp, can flex calf point really cramps
little bit, almost feels like nodding up, pretty good indication going
able stimulate muscle well load movement
properly. feeling actually aim repetition, maybe even
throughout repetition. me, completely transformed results. was,
think maybe five/six years ago first heard you, body parts me,
lagged behind, thought maybe genetically weren't going work me,
immediately just started growing, right? getting stronger stronger,
thought really something much dedicated portion research
along with, collaboration another group try understand happening
upper motor neurons brain can engage muscles even more.
not just progressive overload putting pump muscle.
really mind muscle connection real thing comes predicting results
can get better it. forgive paraphrasing incredible content
around this, made tremendous difference number people
passed along to. can you, first all, arrive that?
hear mind-muscle connection, really heard first you.
arrive kind cramp test, Cavaliere test call it? always
weird people name things science, scientists can
name things. now officially Cavaliere test, whether not can
cramp muscle absence load, just flexing point hurts little
bit. good indication grow muscle well.
come this? - mean, honestly, something made sense me,
workouts, even young kid just starting out, always wanted know
working? lot people ask question think, like,
supposed work? lot, don't know ever noticed, like people


ask question, trained trainer, trainer's saying, well, just
this, exercise show it. say,
supposed work? supposed feel this, right? People, just
inherently ask question? lot people will. one that,
asked question. Not knew doing, just don't
know, wanted know supposed work. that,
start seek out, say, okay, well, bicep supposed
work, want make sure bicep's work. just sort
really like tweak movement make work feel uncomfortable,
get stronger contraction, knowing supposed job, wasn't PT
school learning, oh, well, flexion elbow brachial bias
bias' responsible supination. started to, learned components it,
wanted know bring arm curl, supposed job?
seek ways make happen better. able that,
feel stronger contraction. just, don't know it, just, no
visionary, just felt like knew going better muscle
trying grow stressed effectively. attempting
across different exercises, notice potentially curl
arm up, asking flex bicep position, couldn't
concentration curl, couldn't carry cable curl, shouldn't
really change, 'cause function still largely same, still elbow flexion,
still supination, not able there? sort clued
like, mind-muscle connection not just mind one muscle,
every exercise matters, varies exercise exercise. even
don't gain muscle size that, although think hard not to, especially
not used that, term like call muscularity,
difference, right? level sort resting tone muscle. improves
dramatically. can learn just start engage muscle better,
muscularity, resting tone muscle harder, attention,
alive. driven able connect better neurologically muscle
trying train. talked lot efficiency really trying
seek movements trying create hypertrophy. strength
goal, efficiency movement looking for. looking
muscles tied together work well efficiently, chest, shoulders, triceps,


get bar off chest bench press. not looking make
inefficient leverages chest, try grow chest bench press,
trying let whole package come together greater output.
trying go create muscle hypertrophy even muscularity talk about,
need seek ways make feel uncomfortable. don't feel discomfort,
something wrong. struggle day certain muscle groups
still that, even knowing trying work knowing goal
everything preaching here. difficult muscles certain people
certain muscles. mentioned, practice help.
become consistent

00:35:05 “Muscularity” & Resting Tone

deliberate trying do, result actually get. -
couple really couple points like delve further. First all, hunch
always muscle groups grew easily contract hardest
without any- first time Cavaliere test, got 10 10. give 10
10 scale. just like cinch, isolate muscles, cinch them, grow easily.
mean, certain body parts, don't want say ones, 'cause doesn't really
matter, always felt like just pushups, grow, muscles
far away muscles supposed involved pushups, even
though like think pushups correctly. tell not.
think genetic, sports played
younger. swam, played soccer, skateboard. later boxed.
muscles involved sports always easy engage later went
gym. guess perhaps call parents, kids lot dynamic activity,
seems like might good idea. thing issue muscularity.
glad brought up. are, imagine large number listeners
don't want get bigger. don't want take larger clothing size. don't
want take space. fact, like take less space,
want quality describing, that, oftentimes hear
the, stereotyping bit, kindness. hear women haven't
weight trained, say, don't want get big, often. Sometimes do,
women helped weight train talked weight train say, don't want


get big, want get toned. think referring quality
muscularity. - hundred percent, - idea resting close rest, anytime
someone reaches grabs glass, muscles almost look like kind
twitching underneath skin. yet Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.
thing muscularity, resting tone, physiological basis, think readily
nerves communicating muscles. saying learning
engage muscles actively, resting tone muscularity can improve.
seen men women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - think
something takes upkeep, maintenance, develop muscle,
can just kind let coast. - think like everything key, requires upkeep,
know, user lose it, believe firmly, like think development
connections going harder maintenance connection. said,
still struggle day unnamed muscle groups, also,-
just certain areas harder brain whatever reason just develop
connection type level create extra strong contraction. think
proper dedication focus, go right say, calves one
areas don't necessarily great connection with, also obviously must not
care much 'cause don't put time effort create connection could.
think might happen is, know yeah, struggle there,
struggle comes disinterest, 'cause like, well screw it, calf knot
not going anything it. think put required effort in,
time repetitions will develop that, develop it, going
stick around lot longer not invested time all, not
requiring much that. mean, don't know, like mentioned, now
train, like, just, just part train now, like going hard,
trying really forcefully contract. not just moving weight, say
point point B, like trying contract weight range.
mindset try put everything doing, unless course focused
strength exercise just trying lift greater amount use muscles
together. goal inefficiency hypertrophy, really trying create
contraction, just part training. guess consistency's sake,
long training happening. get away training not happening
all, know, even there, probably another embarrassing admission probably, will
mindfully throughout day, even no weight hand, certain muscle


groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

go pretty long, start feel achy start problems. again, depending upon
age, also plays factor length. again, think everybody can achieve,

00:13:27 Tool: Optimizing Body Part Training Splits

standard program, can achieve results want within hour. - terms
splits, mentioned splits. aren't familiar term splits,
really body parts training on? days? Seems like almost
everybody follows weekly workout schedule. Although body course doesn't care
week. no reason thing every seven days twice every
seven days makes sense physiologically, just body doesn't work that. But,
way life structured. seen discuss three days week, whole body
workouts. heard splits like pushing one day, pulling another day, legs another
day, day off, repeat. mean, many variations this.
general themes can throw there? order avoid huge matrix
possibilities, wonderful content points those. will cap-
caption show notes, link different ways design splits.
terms giving people logic think splitting body parts,
governing split? rules logic dictate split? - me,
first rule will stick it? Like you, 'cause split, don't particularly like full
body splits. actually talking Jesse day like, don't
necessarily like train everything. Now course volumes will come
per muscle group. don't like that, actually don't look forward
workout dreading everything feeling maybe
fatigued time workout's over, fact generally take little
bit longer don't fit schedule. don't care effective split is, split not
done not effective. need find one fits. maybe go
alternative option, like push-pull-legs, like mentioned. done
either one cycle week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday split,
twice week. actually training six times, repeat it, pull-push-legs,
pull-push-legs, however want either day off three
days, end six days. again, actually impacts schedule.
broken it's, put three days, good
giving extra rest day between, starts shift day


off every week wrap around. guys choosing seven day
schedule convenience heads, starts mess off day. others
like just keep predictably, say Sunday, train six days row.
better way maybe group similar muscle actions together, think,
definitely prefer that, going training pulling movements, least
synergy them. feel like looking achieve one goal day.
then, mean, quite honestly, can go back bro-split days, still
work effectively. reason worked past. think science
shows smarter ways days. Like can come back hit
related muscle, do, say biceps one day come back two
days later back, realizing again, synergy exercises there,
biceps going get re-stimulated again. figure ways make
work, thing think effective there, tends one ones
people like most. can go in, get pump, feel good.
pretty solely focused one muscle group. - definition bro-split? One... -
One muscle group day? - Yeah, see, much geared towards strength
aesthetics really maximizing... - Probably aesthetics strength, yeah.
just... - Hence bro, bro name. - again, like, know, science
guy appreciate benefits bro-split. Especially 'cause again, like
end? goal trying achieve here? ours. Like applying
standards goals even like athletic ideals, just want get
shape, perfectly fine bro split instance, sticking
seeing results want see it. able really keep
focus one muscle, get focus on. Look, lot times people struggle
way exercise feels second third set. Like don't
proper percept ability kind lock exercise. spending few, not
sets exercise, another exercise muscle group
helps dial little bit better get training. - Yeah,
raised really interesting, think important question. Early started resistance
training, 16 high school, got touch learning
Mike Menzer. - too, crazy. - Mike helpful. Very, helpful.
got friendly... - So, just read book, didn't get chance him,
jealous, right? - Well, back no internet, paid Western Union type thing send
money - back magazine. - got phone


mother time like, grown man calling house?
gave straightforward split, shoulders, arms one day,
taking two days off training legs two days off chest
back, et cetera. - variation bro-split too. sort breaking
way, chest back chest bis, know? - worked
well me, probably would've, age think,
untrained, think, largely untrained, think would've grown many different programs,
worked well me. eventually just made every day thing.
Shoulders arms day off, legs day two off, 'cause hit legs right, least
me, not training next day. not much anything athletic
next day, chest, back repeat on. reason found helpful
almost always recovered workouts. six day week program push-pull-
legs, push-pull-legs, seems excruciating two standpoints. One is, least
recovery abilities, lack recovery abilities, can't imagine coming back
feeling fresh. one is, gym four days week, really
start fatigue whole psychological experience it. Whereas
three four days week. words, put day off workout,
really want there. get lot fire. also things
off days. think that, love mentioned split stick to.
can bring intensity to, think really important.
sometimes hear two day training. done two day training twice
lifetime,

00:20:12 Two-a-Day Training

times got sick two days later. correlation, not causation. ever
instance two day weight training makes sense non-drug assisted, typical
recovery ability person? - Actually, think makes sense scenarios,
doesn't make sense practically lot people's schedules. like break
down, say going even version total body session,
maybe like going upper lower split, right? upper workout
anterior chain pushing portion one session come
back pulling session later night, opportunity to. thing
benefit freshness focus. Again, like something head


sacrificed time get towards latter half whatever workout in.
point made like, start approach 50 minutes
hour mark, either losing focus, losing energy, losing contract
viability, losing something. relegating whatever is, pulling
portion end workout, something suffers that, realize
happening, maybe switch next time workout
pulling portion upper workout goes first, pushing goes
later, least not just continuing cycle, time,
able kind split up, get chance kind take break,
freshness focus again, actually get better effort in, 'cause again,
think effort drives results. effort not compromised,
able that. systemically problem? think problem
lot people. just hard to, hard rev engine lot times day.
warm thing once, like car winter, get going once,
lucky, okay, now got drive rest day. put garage
try start next day, problem. So, know, young people can get away
lot older people could. - Well, never strong recovery quotient,
stick one day off between, every while, two days row
training, maybe travel want make sure get workouts
kind thing, seem okay. like example warming car, spoken
like true east coaster, us west coast, took moment there,

00:22:33 Cardiovascular Conditioning, High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) & Skills

folks East Coast Midwest, get it, certainly Europe.
terms mixing cardiovascular training resistance training, day,
different day, one come first, one come second? one main
goals, again, everyone listening different goals are, people like either
maintain gain muscle. don't know many people want lose muscle.
maintain gains muscle, usually specific locations body, people
like bit leaner lot leaner. people
either naturally lean don't want, actually just want gain weight. assuming
people want get leaner, put muscle, maintain muscle, want
healthy heart healthy brain, basically requires healthy cardiovascular


system, incorporate cardiovascular work overall weekly
regimen? - again, think bare minimum probably twice week terms
cardiovascular. want semblance cardiovascular conditioning.
think people actually need want pursue
going need time that. point can't just relegated day
off, day off weight training workouts. point occur
day. case, just like put it, is, not primary goal,
looking the, just overall picture, aesthetics mentioned, putting
muscle certain areas, put end workout. 'Cause
don't want way compromise weight training work out. sort
referenced couple times already, intensity workouts important.
know strength component workouts also going helpful
stimulus growth. conditioning, cardio, stuff done prior training,
strength training, workout, likely going impair ability perform best.
unless just done quick little warmup beginning, not sustained
long enough really benefit cardiovascular conditioning. just like put
end, realizing even effort level lower, output lower, still
placing demand cardiac output get conditioning effect
fatigued, still demand cardiac output, still achieving goal,
didn't interfere main goal able increase performance gym. -
Got it. terms form cardiovascular training, seen number of,
say impressive high intensity interval type work. burpee type work,
pushups crunches mixed them, anyway, people can see videos, didn't
describe best way, rather treadmill jogging 30-45
minutes, prefer higher intensity, higher heart rate type training,
live cold Connecticut, don't want jogging
roads middle winter? - think above, mean, factors
personal level, think are- blend function across realms
not delineation between, way training,
conditioning, figure way blend together, always think got
better opportunity get well rounded result. like kind mix
straight conditioning work also footwork drills. high
expectations guys come programs, like just footwork drills. -
Like ladders. - Like ladders, line drills something. know happens?


People become intrigued interested. Like never, haven't tried since high
school. become interested just challenge it, become
almost distracted challenge, now like finding conditioning.
always think important part, sometimes got draw people show
might interested in. output effect it, just think
able blend some, still maintain strength training
exercise, mentioned, say kind push burpee,
anaerobic component going helpful, rather
just walking just jogging. Not say isn't effective means strict cardiac
conditioning, one ways centuries, it. just
think can blend it, becomes maybe little bit interesting
get crossover benefits, doesn't become segmented terms
trying do. - love idea bringing mental challenge
desire improve skill conditioning. not something thought
before, simply 'cause overlooked it, makes sense because, sister
reasonably fit, although always trying get bit more, always
asks me, take? a, don't believe supplements certain
people certain instances, keep telling her, know, it's, behaviors going
end, nutrition going greatest outsize positive effect. loves
things like dance classes things, kickboxing, kinds things which,
makes sense can hook somebody conditioning aspect skill
aspect kind trick cardio, speak terrific. Also
neuroscientist just say, forgive me, anytime engaging two
sets motor neurons, ones brain, upper motor neurons ones
spinal cord, anytime engaging upper motor neurons,
deliberate well controlled action, great thing brain

00:28:24 Tool: Mind-Muscle Connection, Cavaliere Cramp Contraction Test

terms brain longevity. So, now need incorporate actual skills
training. Going back weight training bit, one important things learned
you, years that, training increase muscle size, really
think, not much moving weights, challenging muscles. - Yeah. -
also heard friend, Ben Pakulski, well accomplished,


bodybuilder, now aspects fitness, teaches fitness, don't move
weights challenge muscles, unless trying power lift something sort,
not, immensely helpful. thing learned that,
combined idea certain muscles will grow better get stronger
much easily, maybe even will recover better ability contract
really hard. call Cavaliere test, least paraphrase,
instance, can, always bicep, isn't it? use calf bicep.
can flex bicep point hurts little bit, like almost feels like
cramp cramp, can flex calf point really cramps
little bit, almost feels like nodding up, pretty good indication going
able stimulate muscle well load movement
properly. feeling actually aim repetition, maybe even
throughout repetition. me, completely transformed results. was,
think maybe five/six years ago first heard you, body parts me,
lagged behind, thought maybe genetically weren't going work me,
immediately just started growing, right? getting stronger stronger,
thought really something much dedicated portion research
along with, collaboration another group try understand happening
upper motor neurons brain can engage muscles even more.
not just progressive overload putting pump muscle.
really mind muscle connection real thing comes predicting results
can get better it. forgive paraphrasing incredible content
around this, made tremendous difference number people
passed along to. can you, first all, arrive that?
hear mind-muscle connection, really heard first you.
arrive kind cramp test, Cavaliere test call it? always
weird people name things science, scientists can
name things. now officially Cavaliere test, whether not can
cramp muscle absence load, just flexing point hurts little
bit. good indication grow muscle well.
come this? - mean, honestly, something made sense me,
workouts, even young kid just starting out, always wanted know
working? lot people ask question think, like,
supposed work? lot, don't know ever noticed, like people


ask question, trained trainer, trainer's saying, well, just
this, exercise show it. say,
supposed work? supposed feel this, right? People, just
inherently ask question? lot people will. one that,
asked question. Not knew doing, just don't
know, wanted know supposed work. that,
start seek out, say, okay, well, bicep supposed
work, want make sure bicep's work. just sort
really like tweak movement make work feel uncomfortable,
get stronger contraction, knowing supposed job, wasn't PT
school learning, oh, well, flexion elbow brachial bias
bias' responsible supination. started to, learned components it,
wanted know bring arm curl, supposed job?
seek ways make happen better. able that,
feel stronger contraction. just, don't know it, just, no
visionary, just felt like knew going better muscle
trying grow stressed effectively. attempting
across different exercises, notice potentially curl
arm up, asking flex bicep position, couldn't
concentration curl, couldn't carry cable curl, shouldn't
really change, 'cause function still largely same, still elbow flexion,
still supination, not able there? sort clued
like, mind-muscle connection not just mind one muscle,
every exercise matters, varies exercise exercise. even
don't gain muscle size that, although think hard not to, especially
not used that, term like call muscularity,
difference, right? level sort resting tone muscle. improves
dramatically. can learn just start engage muscle better,
muscularity, resting tone muscle harder, attention,
alive. driven able connect better neurologically muscle
trying train. talked lot efficiency really trying
seek movements trying create hypertrophy. strength
goal, efficiency movement looking for. looking
muscles tied together work well efficiently, chest, shoulders, triceps,


get bar off chest bench press. not looking make
inefficient leverages chest, try grow chest bench press,
trying let whole package come together greater output.
trying go create muscle hypertrophy even muscularity talk about,
need seek ways make feel uncomfortable. don't feel discomfort,
something wrong. struggle day certain muscle groups
still that, even knowing trying work knowing goal
everything preaching here. difficult muscles certain people
certain muscles. mentioned, practice help.
become consistent

00:35:05 “Muscularity” & Resting Tone

deliberate trying do, result actually get. -
couple really couple points like delve further. First all, hunch
always muscle groups grew easily contract hardest
without any- first time Cavaliere test, got 10 10. give 10
10 scale. just like cinch, isolate muscles, cinch them, grow easily.
mean, certain body parts, don't want say ones, 'cause doesn't really
matter, always felt like just pushups, grow, muscles
far away muscles supposed involved pushups, even
though like think pushups correctly. tell not.
think genetic, sports played
younger. swam, played soccer, skateboard. later boxed.
muscles involved sports always easy engage later went
gym. guess perhaps call parents, kids lot dynamic activity,
seems like might good idea. thing issue muscularity.
glad brought up. are, imagine large number listeners
don't want get bigger. don't want take larger clothing size. don't
want take space. fact, like take less space,
want quality describing, that, oftentimes hear
the, stereotyping bit, kindness. hear women haven't
weight trained, say, don't want get big, often. Sometimes do,
women helped weight train talked weight train say, don't want


get big, want get toned. think referring quality
muscularity. - hundred percent, - idea resting close rest, anytime
someone reaches grabs glass, muscles almost look like kind
twitching underneath skin. yet Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.
thing muscularity, resting tone, physiological basis, think readily
nerves communicating muscles. saying learning
engage muscles actively, resting tone muscularity can improve.
seen men women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - think
something takes upkeep, maintenance, develop muscle,
can just kind let coast. - think like everything key, requires upkeep,
know, user lose it, believe firmly, like think development
connections going harder maintenance connection. said,
still struggle day unnamed muscle groups, also,-
just certain areas harder brain whatever reason just develop
connection type level create extra strong contraction. think
proper dedication focus, go right say, calves one
areas don't necessarily great connection with, also obviously must not
care much 'cause don't put time effort create connection could.
think might happen is, know yeah, struggle there,
struggle comes disinterest, 'cause like, well screw it, calf knot
not going anything it. think put required effort in,
time repetitions will develop that, develop it, going
stick around lot longer not invested time all, not
requiring much that. mean, don't know, like mentioned, now
train, like, just, just part train now, like going hard,
trying really forcefully contract. not just moving weight, say
point point B, like trying contract weight range.
mindset try put everything doing, unless course focused
strength exercise just trying lift greater amount use muscles
together. goal inefficiency hypertrophy, really trying create
contraction, just part training. guess consistency's sake,
long training happening. get away training not happening
all, know, even there, probably another embarrassing admission probably, will
mindfully throughout day, even no weight hand, certain muscle


groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

off every week wrap around. guys choosing seven day
schedule convenience heads, starts mess off day. others
like just keep predictably, say Sunday, train six days row.
better way maybe group similar muscle actions together, think,
definitely prefer that, going training pulling movements, least
synergy them. feel like looking achieve one goal day.
then, mean, quite honestly, can go back bro-split days, still
work effectively. reason worked past. think science
shows smarter ways days. Like can come back hit
related muscle, do, say biceps one day come back two
days later back, realizing again, synergy exercises there,
biceps going get re-stimulated again. figure ways make
work, thing think effective there, tends one ones
people like most. can go in, get pump, feel good.
pretty solely focused one muscle group. - definition bro-split? One... -
One muscle group day? - Yeah, see, much geared towards strength
aesthetics really maximizing... - Probably aesthetics strength, yeah.
just... - Hence bro, bro name. - again, like, know, science
guy appreciate benefits bro-split. Especially 'cause again, like
end? goal trying achieve here? ours. Like applying
standards goals even like athletic ideals, just want get
shape, perfectly fine bro split instance, sticking
seeing results want see it. able really keep
focus one muscle, get focus on. Look, lot times people struggle
way exercise feels second third set. Like don't
proper percept ability kind lock exercise. spending few, not
sets exercise, another exercise muscle group
helps dial little bit better get training. - Yeah,
raised really interesting, think important question. Early started resistance
training, 16 high school, got touch learning
Mike Menzer. - too, crazy. - Mike helpful. Very, helpful.
got friendly... - So, just read book, didn't get chance him,
jealous, right? - Well, back no internet, paid Western Union type thing send
money - back magazine. - got phone


mother time like, grown man calling house?
gave straightforward split, shoulders, arms one day,
taking two days off training legs two days off chest
back, et cetera. - variation bro-split too. sort breaking
way, chest back chest bis, know? - worked
well me, probably would've, age think,
untrained, think, largely untrained, think would've grown many different programs,
worked well me. eventually just made every day thing.
Shoulders arms day off, legs day two off, 'cause hit legs right, least
me, not training next day. not much anything athletic
next day, chest, back repeat on. reason found helpful
almost always recovered workouts. six day week program push-pull-
legs, push-pull-legs, seems excruciating two standpoints. One is, least
recovery abilities, lack recovery abilities, can't imagine coming back
feeling fresh. one is, gym four days week, really
start fatigue whole psychological experience it. Whereas
three four days week. words, put day off workout,
really want there. get lot fire. also things
off days. think that, love mentioned split stick to.
can bring intensity to, think really important.
sometimes hear two day training. done two day training twice
lifetime,

00:20:12 Two-a-Day Training

times got sick two days later. correlation, not causation. ever
instance two day weight training makes sense non-drug assisted, typical
recovery ability person? - Actually, think makes sense scenarios,
doesn't make sense practically lot people's schedules. like break
down, say going even version total body session,
maybe like going upper lower split, right? upper workout
anterior chain pushing portion one session come
back pulling session later night, opportunity to. thing
benefit freshness focus. Again, like something head


sacrificed time get towards latter half whatever workout in.
point made like, start approach 50 minutes
hour mark, either losing focus, losing energy, losing contract
viability, losing something. relegating whatever is, pulling
portion end workout, something suffers that, realize
happening, maybe switch next time workout
pulling portion upper workout goes first, pushing goes
later, least not just continuing cycle, time,
able kind split up, get chance kind take break,
freshness focus again, actually get better effort in, 'cause again,
think effort drives results. effort not compromised,
able that. systemically problem? think problem
lot people. just hard to, hard rev engine lot times day.
warm thing once, like car winter, get going once,
lucky, okay, now got drive rest day. put garage
try start next day, problem. So, know, young people can get away
lot older people could. - Well, never strong recovery quotient,
stick one day off between, every while, two days row
training, maybe travel want make sure get workouts
kind thing, seem okay. like example warming car, spoken
like true east coaster, us west coast, took moment there,

00:22:33 Cardiovascular Conditioning, High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) & Skills

folks East Coast Midwest, get it, certainly Europe.
terms mixing cardiovascular training resistance training, day,
different day, one come first, one come second? one main
goals, again, everyone listening different goals are, people like either
maintain gain muscle. don't know many people want lose muscle.
maintain gains muscle, usually specific locations body, people
like bit leaner lot leaner. people
either naturally lean don't want, actually just want gain weight. assuming
people want get leaner, put muscle, maintain muscle, want
healthy heart healthy brain, basically requires healthy cardiovascular


system, incorporate cardiovascular work overall weekly
regimen? - again, think bare minimum probably twice week terms
cardiovascular. want semblance cardiovascular conditioning.
think people actually need want pursue
going need time that. point can't just relegated day
off, day off weight training workouts. point occur
day. case, just like put it, is, not primary goal,
looking the, just overall picture, aesthetics mentioned, putting
muscle certain areas, put end workout. 'Cause
don't want way compromise weight training work out. sort
referenced couple times already, intensity workouts important.
know strength component workouts also going helpful
stimulus growth. conditioning, cardio, stuff done prior training,
strength training, workout, likely going impair ability perform best.
unless just done quick little warmup beginning, not sustained
long enough really benefit cardiovascular conditioning. just like put
end, realizing even effort level lower, output lower, still
placing demand cardiac output get conditioning effect
fatigued, still demand cardiac output, still achieving goal,
didn't interfere main goal able increase performance gym. -
Got it. terms form cardiovascular training, seen number of,
say impressive high intensity interval type work. burpee type work,
pushups crunches mixed them, anyway, people can see videos, didn't
describe best way, rather treadmill jogging 30-45
minutes, prefer higher intensity, higher heart rate type training,
live cold Connecticut, don't want jogging
roads middle winter? - think above, mean, factors
personal level, think are- blend function across realms
not delineation between, way training,
conditioning, figure way blend together, always think got
better opportunity get well rounded result. like kind mix
straight conditioning work also footwork drills. high
expectations guys come programs, like just footwork drills. -
Like ladders. - Like ladders, line drills something. know happens?


People become intrigued interested. Like never, haven't tried since high
school. become interested just challenge it, become
almost distracted challenge, now like finding conditioning.
always think important part, sometimes got draw people show
might interested in. output effect it, just think
able blend some, still maintain strength training
exercise, mentioned, say kind push burpee,
anaerobic component going helpful, rather
just walking just jogging. Not say isn't effective means strict cardiac
conditioning, one ways centuries, it. just
think can blend it, becomes maybe little bit interesting
get crossover benefits, doesn't become segmented terms
trying do. - love idea bringing mental challenge
desire improve skill conditioning. not something thought
before, simply 'cause overlooked it, makes sense because, sister
reasonably fit, although always trying get bit more, always
asks me, take? a, don't believe supplements certain
people certain instances, keep telling her, know, it's, behaviors going
end, nutrition going greatest outsize positive effect. loves
things like dance classes things, kickboxing, kinds things which,
makes sense can hook somebody conditioning aspect skill
aspect kind trick cardio, speak terrific. Also
neuroscientist just say, forgive me, anytime engaging two
sets motor neurons, ones brain, upper motor neurons ones
spinal cord, anytime engaging upper motor neurons,
deliberate well controlled action, great thing brain

00:28:24 Tool: Mind-Muscle Connection, Cavaliere Cramp Contraction Test

terms brain longevity. So, now need incorporate actual skills
training. Going back weight training bit, one important things learned
you, years that, training increase muscle size, really
think, not much moving weights, challenging muscles. - Yeah. -
also heard friend, Ben Pakulski, well accomplished,


bodybuilder, now aspects fitness, teaches fitness, don't move
weights challenge muscles, unless trying power lift something sort,
not, immensely helpful. thing learned that,
combined idea certain muscles will grow better get stronger
much easily, maybe even will recover better ability contract
really hard. call Cavaliere test, least paraphrase,
instance, can, always bicep, isn't it? use calf bicep.
can flex bicep point hurts little bit, like almost feels like
cramp cramp, can flex calf point really cramps
little bit, almost feels like nodding up, pretty good indication going
able stimulate muscle well load movement
properly. feeling actually aim repetition, maybe even
throughout repetition. me, completely transformed results. was,
think maybe five/six years ago first heard you, body parts me,
lagged behind, thought maybe genetically weren't going work me,
immediately just started growing, right? getting stronger stronger,
thought really something much dedicated portion research
along with, collaboration another group try understand happening
upper motor neurons brain can engage muscles even more.
not just progressive overload putting pump muscle.
really mind muscle connection real thing comes predicting results
can get better it. forgive paraphrasing incredible content
around this, made tremendous difference number people
passed along to. can you, first all, arrive that?
hear mind-muscle connection, really heard first you.
arrive kind cramp test, Cavaliere test call it? always
weird people name things science, scientists can
name things. now officially Cavaliere test, whether not can
cramp muscle absence load, just flexing point hurts little
bit. good indication grow muscle well.
come this? - mean, honestly, something made sense me,
workouts, even young kid just starting out, always wanted know
working? lot people ask question think, like,
supposed work? lot, don't know ever noticed, like people


ask question, trained trainer, trainer's saying, well, just
this, exercise show it. say,
supposed work? supposed feel this, right? People, just
inherently ask question? lot people will. one that,
asked question. Not knew doing, just don't
know, wanted know supposed work. that,
start seek out, say, okay, well, bicep supposed
work, want make sure bicep's work. just sort
really like tweak movement make work feel uncomfortable,
get stronger contraction, knowing supposed job, wasn't PT
school learning, oh, well, flexion elbow brachial bias
bias' responsible supination. started to, learned components it,
wanted know bring arm curl, supposed job?
seek ways make happen better. able that,
feel stronger contraction. just, don't know it, just, no
visionary, just felt like knew going better muscle
trying grow stressed effectively. attempting
across different exercises, notice potentially curl
arm up, asking flex bicep position, couldn't
concentration curl, couldn't carry cable curl, shouldn't
really change, 'cause function still largely same, still elbow flexion,
still supination, not able there? sort clued
like, mind-muscle connection not just mind one muscle,
every exercise matters, varies exercise exercise. even
don't gain muscle size that, although think hard not to, especially
not used that, term like call muscularity,
difference, right? level sort resting tone muscle. improves
dramatically. can learn just start engage muscle better,
muscularity, resting tone muscle harder, attention,
alive. driven able connect better neurologically muscle
trying train. talked lot efficiency really trying
seek movements trying create hypertrophy. strength
goal, efficiency movement looking for. looking
muscles tied together work well efficiently, chest, shoulders, triceps,


get bar off chest bench press. not looking make
inefficient leverages chest, try grow chest bench press,
trying let whole package come together greater output.
trying go create muscle hypertrophy even muscularity talk about,
need seek ways make feel uncomfortable. don't feel discomfort,
something wrong. struggle day certain muscle groups
still that, even knowing trying work knowing goal
everything preaching here. difficult muscles certain people
certain muscles. mentioned, practice help.
become consistent

00:35:05 “Muscularity” & Resting Tone

deliberate trying do, result actually get. -
couple really couple points like delve further. First all, hunch
always muscle groups grew easily contract hardest
without any- first time Cavaliere test, got 10 10. give 10
10 scale. just like cinch, isolate muscles, cinch them, grow easily.
mean, certain body parts, don't want say ones, 'cause doesn't really
matter, always felt like just pushups, grow, muscles
far away muscles supposed involved pushups, even
though like think pushups correctly. tell not.
think genetic, sports played
younger. swam, played soccer, skateboard. later boxed.
muscles involved sports always easy engage later went
gym. guess perhaps call parents, kids lot dynamic activity,
seems like might good idea. thing issue muscularity.
glad brought up. are, imagine large number listeners
don't want get bigger. don't want take larger clothing size. don't
want take space. fact, like take less space,
want quality describing, that, oftentimes hear
the, stereotyping bit, kindness. hear women haven't
weight trained, say, don't want get big, often. Sometimes do,
women helped weight train talked weight train say, don't want


get big, want get toned. think referring quality
muscularity. - hundred percent, - idea resting close rest, anytime
someone reaches grabs glass, muscles almost look like kind
twitching underneath skin. yet Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.
thing muscularity, resting tone, physiological basis, think readily
nerves communicating muscles. saying learning
engage muscles actively, resting tone muscularity can improve.
seen men women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - think
something takes upkeep, maintenance, develop muscle,
can just kind let coast. - think like everything key, requires upkeep,
know, user lose it, believe firmly, like think development
connections going harder maintenance connection. said,
still struggle day unnamed muscle groups, also,-
just certain areas harder brain whatever reason just develop
connection type level create extra strong contraction. think
proper dedication focus, go right say, calves one
areas don't necessarily great connection with, also obviously must not
care much 'cause don't put time effort create connection could.
think might happen is, know yeah, struggle there,
struggle comes disinterest, 'cause like, well screw it, calf knot
not going anything it. think put required effort in,
time repetitions will develop that, develop it, going
stick around lot longer not invested time all, not
requiring much that. mean, don't know, like mentioned, now
train, like, just, just part train now, like going hard,
trying really forcefully contract. not just moving weight, say
point point B, like trying contract weight range.
mindset try put everything doing, unless course focused
strength exercise just trying lift greater amount use muscles
together. goal inefficiency hypertrophy, really trying create
contraction, just part training. guess consistency's sake,
long training happening. get away training not happening
all, know, even there, probably another embarrassing admission probably, will
mindfully throughout day, even no weight hand, certain muscle


groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

mother time like, grown man calling house?
gave straightforward split, shoulders, arms one day,
taking two days off training legs two days off chest
back, et cetera. - variation bro-split too. sort breaking
way, chest back chest bis, know? - worked
well me, probably would've, age think,
untrained, think, largely untrained, think would've grown many different programs,
worked well me. eventually just made every day thing.
Shoulders arms day off, legs day two off, 'cause hit legs right, least
me, not training next day. not much anything athletic
next day, chest, back repeat on. reason found helpful
almost always recovered workouts. six day week program push-pull-
legs, push-pull-legs, seems excruciating two standpoints. One is, least
recovery abilities, lack recovery abilities, can't imagine coming back
feeling fresh. one is, gym four days week, really
start fatigue whole psychological experience it. Whereas
three four days week. words, put day off workout,
really want there. get lot fire. also things
off days. think that, love mentioned split stick to.
can bring intensity to, think really important.
sometimes hear two day training. done two day training twice
lifetime,

00:20:12 Two-a-Day Training

times got sick two days later. correlation, not causation. ever
instance two day weight training makes sense non-drug assisted, typical
recovery ability person? - Actually, think makes sense scenarios,
doesn't make sense practically lot people's schedules. like break
down, say going even version total body session,
maybe like going upper lower split, right? upper workout
anterior chain pushing portion one session come
back pulling session later night, opportunity to. thing
benefit freshness focus. Again, like something head


sacrificed time get towards latter half whatever workout in.
point made like, start approach 50 minutes
hour mark, either losing focus, losing energy, losing contract
viability, losing something. relegating whatever is, pulling
portion end workout, something suffers that, realize
happening, maybe switch next time workout
pulling portion upper workout goes first, pushing goes
later, least not just continuing cycle, time,
able kind split up, get chance kind take break,
freshness focus again, actually get better effort in, 'cause again,
think effort drives results. effort not compromised,
able that. systemically problem? think problem
lot people. just hard to, hard rev engine lot times day.
warm thing once, like car winter, get going once,
lucky, okay, now got drive rest day. put garage
try start next day, problem. So, know, young people can get away
lot older people could. - Well, never strong recovery quotient,
stick one day off between, every while, two days row
training, maybe travel want make sure get workouts
kind thing, seem okay. like example warming car, spoken
like true east coaster, us west coast, took moment there,

00:22:33 Cardiovascular Conditioning, High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) & Skills

folks East Coast Midwest, get it, certainly Europe.
terms mixing cardiovascular training resistance training, day,
different day, one come first, one come second? one main
goals, again, everyone listening different goals are, people like either
maintain gain muscle. don't know many people want lose muscle.
maintain gains muscle, usually specific locations body, people
like bit leaner lot leaner. people
either naturally lean don't want, actually just want gain weight. assuming
people want get leaner, put muscle, maintain muscle, want
healthy heart healthy brain, basically requires healthy cardiovascular


system, incorporate cardiovascular work overall weekly
regimen? - again, think bare minimum probably twice week terms
cardiovascular. want semblance cardiovascular conditioning.
think people actually need want pursue
going need time that. point can't just relegated day
off, day off weight training workouts. point occur
day. case, just like put it, is, not primary goal,
looking the, just overall picture, aesthetics mentioned, putting
muscle certain areas, put end workout. 'Cause
don't want way compromise weight training work out. sort
referenced couple times already, intensity workouts important.
know strength component workouts also going helpful
stimulus growth. conditioning, cardio, stuff done prior training,
strength training, workout, likely going impair ability perform best.
unless just done quick little warmup beginning, not sustained
long enough really benefit cardiovascular conditioning. just like put
end, realizing even effort level lower, output lower, still
placing demand cardiac output get conditioning effect
fatigued, still demand cardiac output, still achieving goal,
didn't interfere main goal able increase performance gym. -
Got it. terms form cardiovascular training, seen number of,
say impressive high intensity interval type work. burpee type work,
pushups crunches mixed them, anyway, people can see videos, didn't
describe best way, rather treadmill jogging 30-45
minutes, prefer higher intensity, higher heart rate type training,
live cold Connecticut, don't want jogging
roads middle winter? - think above, mean, factors
personal level, think are- blend function across realms
not delineation between, way training,
conditioning, figure way blend together, always think got
better opportunity get well rounded result. like kind mix
straight conditioning work also footwork drills. high
expectations guys come programs, like just footwork drills. -
Like ladders. - Like ladders, line drills something. know happens?


People become intrigued interested. Like never, haven't tried since high
school. become interested just challenge it, become
almost distracted challenge, now like finding conditioning.
always think important part, sometimes got draw people show
might interested in. output effect it, just think
able blend some, still maintain strength training
exercise, mentioned, say kind push burpee,
anaerobic component going helpful, rather
just walking just jogging. Not say isn't effective means strict cardiac
conditioning, one ways centuries, it. just
think can blend it, becomes maybe little bit interesting
get crossover benefits, doesn't become segmented terms
trying do. - love idea bringing mental challenge
desire improve skill conditioning. not something thought
before, simply 'cause overlooked it, makes sense because, sister
reasonably fit, although always trying get bit more, always
asks me, take? a, don't believe supplements certain
people certain instances, keep telling her, know, it's, behaviors going
end, nutrition going greatest outsize positive effect. loves
things like dance classes things, kickboxing, kinds things which,
makes sense can hook somebody conditioning aspect skill
aspect kind trick cardio, speak terrific. Also
neuroscientist just say, forgive me, anytime engaging two
sets motor neurons, ones brain, upper motor neurons ones
spinal cord, anytime engaging upper motor neurons,
deliberate well controlled action, great thing brain

00:28:24 Tool: Mind-Muscle Connection, Cavaliere Cramp Contraction Test

terms brain longevity. So, now need incorporate actual skills
training. Going back weight training bit, one important things learned
you, years that, training increase muscle size, really
think, not much moving weights, challenging muscles. - Yeah. -
also heard friend, Ben Pakulski, well accomplished,


bodybuilder, now aspects fitness, teaches fitness, don't move
weights challenge muscles, unless trying power lift something sort,
not, immensely helpful. thing learned that,
combined idea certain muscles will grow better get stronger
much easily, maybe even will recover better ability contract
really hard. call Cavaliere test, least paraphrase,
instance, can, always bicep, isn't it? use calf bicep.
can flex bicep point hurts little bit, like almost feels like
cramp cramp, can flex calf point really cramps
little bit, almost feels like nodding up, pretty good indication going
able stimulate muscle well load movement
properly. feeling actually aim repetition, maybe even
throughout repetition. me, completely transformed results. was,
think maybe five/six years ago first heard you, body parts me,
lagged behind, thought maybe genetically weren't going work me,
immediately just started growing, right? getting stronger stronger,
thought really something much dedicated portion research
along with, collaboration another group try understand happening
upper motor neurons brain can engage muscles even more.
not just progressive overload putting pump muscle.
really mind muscle connection real thing comes predicting results
can get better it. forgive paraphrasing incredible content
around this, made tremendous difference number people
passed along to. can you, first all, arrive that?
hear mind-muscle connection, really heard first you.
arrive kind cramp test, Cavaliere test call it? always
weird people name things science, scientists can
name things. now officially Cavaliere test, whether not can
cramp muscle absence load, just flexing point hurts little
bit. good indication grow muscle well.
come this? - mean, honestly, something made sense me,
workouts, even young kid just starting out, always wanted know
working? lot people ask question think, like,
supposed work? lot, don't know ever noticed, like people


ask question, trained trainer, trainer's saying, well, just
this, exercise show it. say,
supposed work? supposed feel this, right? People, just
inherently ask question? lot people will. one that,
asked question. Not knew doing, just don't
know, wanted know supposed work. that,
start seek out, say, okay, well, bicep supposed
work, want make sure bicep's work. just sort
really like tweak movement make work feel uncomfortable,
get stronger contraction, knowing supposed job, wasn't PT
school learning, oh, well, flexion elbow brachial bias
bias' responsible supination. started to, learned components it,
wanted know bring arm curl, supposed job?
seek ways make happen better. able that,
feel stronger contraction. just, don't know it, just, no
visionary, just felt like knew going better muscle
trying grow stressed effectively. attempting
across different exercises, notice potentially curl
arm up, asking flex bicep position, couldn't
concentration curl, couldn't carry cable curl, shouldn't
really change, 'cause function still largely same, still elbow flexion,
still supination, not able there? sort clued
like, mind-muscle connection not just mind one muscle,
every exercise matters, varies exercise exercise. even
don't gain muscle size that, although think hard not to, especially
not used that, term like call muscularity,
difference, right? level sort resting tone muscle. improves
dramatically. can learn just start engage muscle better,
muscularity, resting tone muscle harder, attention,
alive. driven able connect better neurologically muscle
trying train. talked lot efficiency really trying
seek movements trying create hypertrophy. strength
goal, efficiency movement looking for. looking
muscles tied together work well efficiently, chest, shoulders, triceps,


get bar off chest bench press. not looking make
inefficient leverages chest, try grow chest bench press,
trying let whole package come together greater output.
trying go create muscle hypertrophy even muscularity talk about,
need seek ways make feel uncomfortable. don't feel discomfort,
something wrong. struggle day certain muscle groups
still that, even knowing trying work knowing goal
everything preaching here. difficult muscles certain people
certain muscles. mentioned, practice help.
become consistent

00:35:05 “Muscularity” & Resting Tone

deliberate trying do, result actually get. -
couple really couple points like delve further. First all, hunch
always muscle groups grew easily contract hardest
without any- first time Cavaliere test, got 10 10. give 10
10 scale. just like cinch, isolate muscles, cinch them, grow easily.
mean, certain body parts, don't want say ones, 'cause doesn't really
matter, always felt like just pushups, grow, muscles
far away muscles supposed involved pushups, even
though like think pushups correctly. tell not.
think genetic, sports played
younger. swam, played soccer, skateboard. later boxed.
muscles involved sports always easy engage later went
gym. guess perhaps call parents, kids lot dynamic activity,
seems like might good idea. thing issue muscularity.
glad brought up. are, imagine large number listeners
don't want get bigger. don't want take larger clothing size. don't
want take space. fact, like take less space,
want quality describing, that, oftentimes hear
the, stereotyping bit, kindness. hear women haven't
weight trained, say, don't want get big, often. Sometimes do,
women helped weight train talked weight train say, don't want


get big, want get toned. think referring quality
muscularity. - hundred percent, - idea resting close rest, anytime
someone reaches grabs glass, muscles almost look like kind
twitching underneath skin. yet Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.
thing muscularity, resting tone, physiological basis, think readily
nerves communicating muscles. saying learning
engage muscles actively, resting tone muscularity can improve.
seen men women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - think
something takes upkeep, maintenance, develop muscle,
can just kind let coast. - think like everything key, requires upkeep,
know, user lose it, believe firmly, like think development
connections going harder maintenance connection. said,
still struggle day unnamed muscle groups, also,-
just certain areas harder brain whatever reason just develop
connection type level create extra strong contraction. think
proper dedication focus, go right say, calves one
areas don't necessarily great connection with, also obviously must not
care much 'cause don't put time effort create connection could.
think might happen is, know yeah, struggle there,
struggle comes disinterest, 'cause like, well screw it, calf knot
not going anything it. think put required effort in,
time repetitions will develop that, develop it, going
stick around lot longer not invested time all, not
requiring much that. mean, don't know, like mentioned, now
train, like, just, just part train now, like going hard,
trying really forcefully contract. not just moving weight, say
point point B, like trying contract weight range.
mindset try put everything doing, unless course focused
strength exercise just trying lift greater amount use muscles
together. goal inefficiency hypertrophy, really trying create
contraction, just part training. guess consistency's sake,
long training happening. get away training not happening
all, know, even there, probably another embarrassing admission probably, will
mindfully throughout day, even no weight hand, certain muscle


groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really

sacrificed time get towards latter half whatever workout in.
point made like, start approach 50 minutes
hour mark, either losing focus, losing energy, losing contract
viability, losing something. relegating whatever is, pulling
portion end workout, something suffers that, realize
happening, maybe switch next time workout
pulling portion upper workout goes first, pushing goes
later, least not just continuing cycle, time,
able kind split up, get chance kind take break,
freshness focus again, actually get better effort in, 'cause again,
think effort drives results. effort not compromised,
able that. systemically problem? think problem
lot people. just hard to, hard rev engine lot times day.
warm thing once, like car winter, get going once,
lucky, okay, now got drive rest day. put garage
try start next day, problem. So, know, young people can get away
lot older people could. - Well, never strong recovery quotient,
stick one day off between, every while, two days row
training, maybe travel want make sure get workouts
kind thing, seem okay. like example warming car, spoken
like true east coaster, us west coast, took moment there,

00:22:33 Cardiovascular Conditioning, High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) & Skills

folks East Coast Midwest, get it, certainly Europe.
terms mixing cardiovascular training resistance training, day,
different day, one come first, one come second? one main
goals, again, everyone listening different goals are, people like either
maintain gain muscle. don't know many people want lose muscle.
maintain gains muscle, usually specific locations body, people
like bit leaner lot leaner. people
either naturally lean don't want, actually just want gain weight. assuming
people want get leaner, put muscle, maintain muscle, want
healthy heart healthy brain, basically requires healthy cardiovascular


system, incorporate cardiovascular work overall weekly
regimen? - again, think bare minimum probably twice week terms
cardiovascular. want semblance cardiovascular conditioning.
think people actually need want pursue
going need time that. point can't just relegated day
off, day off weight training workouts. point occur
day. case, just like put it, is, not primary goal,
looking the, just overall picture, aesthetics mentioned, putting
muscle certain areas, put end workout. 'Cause
don't want way compromise weight training work out. sort
referenced couple times already, intensity workouts important.
know strength component workouts also going helpful
stimulus growth. conditioning, cardio, stuff done prior training,
strength training, workout, likely going impair ability perform best.
unless just done quick little warmup beginning, not sustained
long enough really benefit cardiovascular conditioning. just like put
end, realizing even effort level lower, output lower, still
placing demand cardiac output get conditioning effect
fatigued, still demand cardiac output, still achieving goal,
didn't interfere main goal able increase performance gym. -
Got it. terms form cardiovascular training, seen number of,
say impressive high intensity interval type work. burpee type work,
pushups crunches mixed them, anyway, people can see videos, didn't
describe best way, rather treadmill jogging 30-45
minutes, prefer higher intensity, higher heart rate type training,
live cold Connecticut, don't want jogging
roads middle winter? - think above, mean, factors
personal level, think are- blend function across realms
not delineation between, way training,
conditioning, figure way blend together, always think got
better opportunity get well rounded result. like kind mix
straight conditioning work also footwork drills. high
expectations guys come programs, like just footwork drills. -
Like ladders. - Like ladders, line drills something. know happens?


People become intrigued interested. Like never, haven't tried since high
school. become interested just challenge it, become
almost distracted challenge, now like finding conditioning.
always think important part, sometimes got draw people show
might interested in. output effect it, just think
able blend some, still maintain strength training
exercise, mentioned, say kind push burpee,
anaerobic component going helpful, rather
just walking just jogging. Not say isn't effective means strict cardiac
conditioning, one ways centuries, it. just
think can blend it, becomes maybe little bit interesting
get crossover benefits, doesn't become segmented terms
trying do. - love idea bringing mental challenge
desire improve skill conditioning. not something thought
before, simply 'cause overlooked it, makes sense because, sister
reasonably fit, although always trying get bit more, always
asks me, take? a, don't believe supplements certain
people certain instances, keep telling her, know, it's, behaviors going
end, nutrition going greatest outsize positive effect. loves
things like dance classes things, kickboxing, kinds things which,
makes sense can hook somebody conditioning aspect skill
aspect kind trick cardio, speak terrific. Also
neuroscientist just say, forgive me, anytime engaging two
sets motor neurons, ones brain, upper motor neurons ones
spinal cord, anytime engaging upper motor neurons,
deliberate well controlled action, great thing brain

00:28:24 Tool: Mind-Muscle Connection, Cavaliere Cramp Contraction Test

terms brain longevity. So, now need incorporate actual skills
training. Going back weight training bit, one important things learned
you, years that, training increase muscle size, really
think, not much moving weights, challenging muscles. - Yeah. -
also heard friend, Ben Pakulski, well accomplished,


bodybuilder, now aspects fitness, teaches fitness, don't move
weights challenge muscles, unless trying power lift something sort,
not, immensely helpful. thing learned that,
combined idea certain muscles will grow better get stronger
much easily, maybe even will recover better ability contract
really hard. call Cavaliere test, least paraphrase,
instance, can, always bicep, isn't it? use calf bicep.
can flex bicep point hurts little bit, like almost feels like
cramp cramp, can flex calf point really cramps
little bit, almost feels like nodding up, pretty good indication going
able stimulate muscle well load movement
properly. feeling actually aim repetition, maybe even
throughout repetition. me, completely transformed results. was,
think maybe five/six years ago first heard you, body parts me,
lagged behind, thought maybe genetically weren't going work me,
immediately just started growing, right? getting stronger stronger,
thought really something much dedicated portion research
along with, collaboration another group try understand happening
upper motor neurons brain can engage muscles even more.
not just progressive overload putting pump muscle.
really mind muscle connection real thing comes predicting results
can get better it. forgive paraphrasing incredible content
around this, made tremendous difference number people
passed along to. can you, first all, arrive that?
hear mind-muscle connection, really heard first you.
arrive kind cramp test, Cavaliere test call it? always
weird people name things science, scientists can
name things. now officially Cavaliere test, whether not can
cramp muscle absence load, just flexing point hurts little
bit. good indication grow muscle well.
come this? - mean, honestly, something made sense me,
workouts, even young kid just starting out, always wanted know
working? lot people ask question think, like,
supposed work? lot, don't know ever noticed, like people


ask question, trained trainer, trainer's saying, well, just
this, exercise show it. say,
supposed work? supposed feel this, right? People, just
inherently ask question? lot people will. one that,
asked question. Not knew doing, just don't
know, wanted know supposed work. that,
start seek out, say, okay, well, bicep supposed
work, want make sure bicep's work. just sort
really like tweak movement make work feel uncomfortable,
get stronger contraction, knowing supposed job, wasn't PT
school learning, oh, well, flexion elbow brachial bias
bias' responsible supination. started to, learned components it,
wanted know bring arm curl, supposed job?
seek ways make happen better. able that,
feel stronger contraction. just, don't know it, just, no
visionary, just felt like knew going better muscle
trying grow stressed effectively. attempting
across different exercises, notice potentially curl
arm up, asking flex bicep position, couldn't
concentration curl, couldn't carry cable curl, shouldn't
really change, 'cause function still largely same, still elbow flexion,
still supination, not able there? sort clued
like, mind-muscle connection not just mind one muscle,
every exercise matters, varies exercise exercise. even
don't gain muscle size that, although think hard not to, especially
not used that, term like call muscularity,
difference, right? level sort resting tone muscle. improves
dramatically. can learn just start engage muscle better,
muscularity, resting tone muscle harder, attention,
alive. driven able connect better neurologically muscle
trying train. talked lot efficiency really trying
seek movements trying create hypertrophy. strength
goal, efficiency movement looking for. looking
muscles tied together work well efficiently, chest, shoulders, triceps,


get bar off chest bench press. not looking make
inefficient leverages chest, try grow chest bench press,
trying let whole package come together greater output.
trying go create muscle hypertrophy even muscularity talk about,
need seek ways make feel uncomfortable. don't feel discomfort,
something wrong. struggle day certain muscle groups
still that, even knowing trying work knowing goal
everything preaching here. difficult muscles certain people
certain muscles. mentioned, practice help.
become consistent

00:35:05 “Muscularity” & Resting Tone

deliberate trying do, result actually get. -
couple really couple points like delve further. First all, hunch
always muscle groups grew easily contract hardest
without any- first time Cavaliere test, got 10 10. give 10
10 scale. just like cinch, isolate muscles, cinch them, grow easily.
mean, certain body parts, don't want say ones, 'cause doesn't really
matter, always felt like just pushups, grow, muscles
far away muscles supposed involved pushups, even
though like think pushups correctly. tell not.
think genetic, sports played
younger. swam, played soccer, skateboard. later boxed.
muscles involved sports always easy engage later went
gym. guess perhaps call parents, kids lot dynamic activity,
seems like might good idea. thing issue muscularity.
glad brought up. are, imagine large number listeners
don't want get bigger. don't want take larger clothing size. don't
want take space. fact, like take less space,
want quality describing, that, oftentimes hear
the, stereotyping bit, kindness. hear women haven't
weight trained, say, don't want get big, often. Sometimes do,
women helped weight train talked weight train say, don't want


get big, want get toned. think referring quality
muscularity. - hundred percent, - idea resting close rest, anytime
someone reaches grabs glass, muscles almost look like kind
twitching underneath skin. yet Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.
thing muscularity, resting tone, physiological basis, think readily
nerves communicating muscles. saying learning
engage muscles actively, resting tone muscularity can improve.
seen men women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - think
something takes upkeep, maintenance, develop muscle,
can just kind let coast. - think like everything key, requires upkeep,
know, user lose it, believe firmly, like think development
connections going harder maintenance connection. said,
still struggle day unnamed muscle groups, also,-
just certain areas harder brain whatever reason just develop
connection type level create extra strong contraction. think
proper dedication focus, go right say, calves one
areas don't necessarily great connection with, also obviously must not
care much 'cause don't put time effort create connection could.
think might happen is, know yeah, struggle there,
struggle comes disinterest, 'cause like, well screw it, calf knot
not going anything it. think put required effort in,
time repetitions will develop that, develop it, going
stick around lot longer not invested time all, not
requiring much that. mean, don't know, like mentioned, now
train, like, just, just part train now, like going hard,
trying really forcefully contract. not just moving weight, say
point point B, like trying contract weight range.
mindset try put everything doing, unless course focused
strength exercise just trying lift greater amount use muscles
together. goal inefficiency hypertrophy, really trying create
contraction, just part training. guess consistency's sake,
long training happening. get away training not happening
all, know, even there, probably another embarrassing admission probably, will
mindfully throughout day, even no weight hand, certain muscle


groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,

Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

system, incorporate cardiovascular work overall weekly
regimen? - again, think bare minimum probably twice week terms
cardiovascular. want semblance cardiovascular conditioning.
think people actually need want pursue
going need time that. point can't just relegated day
off, day off weight training workouts. point occur
day. case, just like put it, is, not primary goal,
looking the, just overall picture, aesthetics mentioned, putting
muscle certain areas, put end workout. 'Cause
don't want way compromise weight training work out. sort
referenced couple times already, intensity workouts important.
know strength component workouts also going helpful
stimulus growth. conditioning, cardio, stuff done prior training,
strength training, workout, likely going impair ability perform best.
unless just done quick little warmup beginning, not sustained
long enough really benefit cardiovascular conditioning. just like put
end, realizing even effort level lower, output lower, still
placing demand cardiac output get conditioning effect
fatigued, still demand cardiac output, still achieving goal,
didn't interfere main goal able increase performance gym. -
Got it. terms form cardiovascular training, seen number of,
say impressive high intensity interval type work. burpee type work,
pushups crunches mixed them, anyway, people can see videos, didn't
describe best way, rather treadmill jogging 30-45
minutes, prefer higher intensity, higher heart rate type training,
live cold Connecticut, don't want jogging
roads middle winter? - think above, mean, factors
personal level, think are- blend function across realms
not delineation between, way training,
conditioning, figure way blend together, always think got
better opportunity get well rounded result. like kind mix
straight conditioning work also footwork drills. high
expectations guys come programs, like just footwork drills. -
Like ladders. - Like ladders, line drills something. know happens?


People become intrigued interested. Like never, haven't tried since high
school. become interested just challenge it, become
almost distracted challenge, now like finding conditioning.
always think important part, sometimes got draw people show
might interested in. output effect it, just think
able blend some, still maintain strength training
exercise, mentioned, say kind push burpee,
anaerobic component going helpful, rather
just walking just jogging. Not say isn't effective means strict cardiac
conditioning, one ways centuries, it. just
think can blend it, becomes maybe little bit interesting
get crossover benefits, doesn't become segmented terms
trying do. - love idea bringing mental challenge
desire improve skill conditioning. not something thought
before, simply 'cause overlooked it, makes sense because, sister
reasonably fit, although always trying get bit more, always
asks me, take? a, don't believe supplements certain
people certain instances, keep telling her, know, it's, behaviors going
end, nutrition going greatest outsize positive effect. loves
things like dance classes things, kickboxing, kinds things which,
makes sense can hook somebody conditioning aspect skill
aspect kind trick cardio, speak terrific. Also
neuroscientist just say, forgive me, anytime engaging two
sets motor neurons, ones brain, upper motor neurons ones
spinal cord, anytime engaging upper motor neurons,
deliberate well controlled action, great thing brain

00:28:24 Tool: Mind-Muscle Connection, Cavaliere Cramp Contraction Test

terms brain longevity. So, now need incorporate actual skills
training. Going back weight training bit, one important things learned
you, years that, training increase muscle size, really
think, not much moving weights, challenging muscles. - Yeah. -
also heard friend, Ben Pakulski, well accomplished,


bodybuilder, now aspects fitness, teaches fitness, don't move
weights challenge muscles, unless trying power lift something sort,
not, immensely helpful. thing learned that,
combined idea certain muscles will grow better get stronger
much easily, maybe even will recover better ability contract
really hard. call Cavaliere test, least paraphrase,
instance, can, always bicep, isn't it? use calf bicep.
can flex bicep point hurts little bit, like almost feels like
cramp cramp, can flex calf point really cramps
little bit, almost feels like nodding up, pretty good indication going
able stimulate muscle well load movement
properly. feeling actually aim repetition, maybe even
throughout repetition. me, completely transformed results. was,
think maybe five/six years ago first heard you, body parts me,
lagged behind, thought maybe genetically weren't going work me,
immediately just started growing, right? getting stronger stronger,
thought really something much dedicated portion research
along with, collaboration another group try understand happening
upper motor neurons brain can engage muscles even more.
not just progressive overload putting pump muscle.
really mind muscle connection real thing comes predicting results
can get better it. forgive paraphrasing incredible content
around this, made tremendous difference number people
passed along to. can you, first all, arrive that?
hear mind-muscle connection, really heard first you.
arrive kind cramp test, Cavaliere test call it? always
weird people name things science, scientists can
name things. now officially Cavaliere test, whether not can
cramp muscle absence load, just flexing point hurts little
bit. good indication grow muscle well.
come this? - mean, honestly, something made sense me,
workouts, even young kid just starting out, always wanted know
working? lot people ask question think, like,
supposed work? lot, don't know ever noticed, like people


ask question, trained trainer, trainer's saying, well, just
this, exercise show it. say,
supposed work? supposed feel this, right? People, just
inherently ask question? lot people will. one that,
asked question. Not knew doing, just don't
know, wanted know supposed work. that,
start seek out, say, okay, well, bicep supposed
work, want make sure bicep's work. just sort
really like tweak movement make work feel uncomfortable,
get stronger contraction, knowing supposed job, wasn't PT
school learning, oh, well, flexion elbow brachial bias
bias' responsible supination. started to, learned components it,
wanted know bring arm curl, supposed job?
seek ways make happen better. able that,
feel stronger contraction. just, don't know it, just, no
visionary, just felt like knew going better muscle
trying grow stressed effectively. attempting
across different exercises, notice potentially curl
arm up, asking flex bicep position, couldn't
concentration curl, couldn't carry cable curl, shouldn't
really change, 'cause function still largely same, still elbow flexion,
still supination, not able there? sort clued
like, mind-muscle connection not just mind one muscle,
every exercise matters, varies exercise exercise. even
don't gain muscle size that, although think hard not to, especially
not used that, term like call muscularity,
difference, right? level sort resting tone muscle. improves
dramatically. can learn just start engage muscle better,
muscularity, resting tone muscle harder, attention,
alive. driven able connect better neurologically muscle
trying train. talked lot efficiency really trying
seek movements trying create hypertrophy. strength
goal, efficiency movement looking for. looking
muscles tied together work well efficiently, chest, shoulders, triceps,


get bar off chest bench press. not looking make
inefficient leverages chest, try grow chest bench press,
trying let whole package come together greater output.
trying go create muscle hypertrophy even muscularity talk about,
need seek ways make feel uncomfortable. don't feel discomfort,
something wrong. struggle day certain muscle groups
still that, even knowing trying work knowing goal
everything preaching here. difficult muscles certain people
certain muscles. mentioned, practice help.
become consistent

00:35:05 “Muscularity” & Resting Tone

deliberate trying do, result actually get. -
couple really couple points like delve further. First all, hunch
always muscle groups grew easily contract hardest
without any- first time Cavaliere test, got 10 10. give 10
10 scale. just like cinch, isolate muscles, cinch them, grow easily.
mean, certain body parts, don't want say ones, 'cause doesn't really
matter, always felt like just pushups, grow, muscles
far away muscles supposed involved pushups, even
though like think pushups correctly. tell not.
think genetic, sports played
younger. swam, played soccer, skateboard. later boxed.
muscles involved sports always easy engage later went
gym. guess perhaps call parents, kids lot dynamic activity,
seems like might good idea. thing issue muscularity.
glad brought up. are, imagine large number listeners
don't want get bigger. don't want take larger clothing size. don't
want take space. fact, like take less space,
want quality describing, that, oftentimes hear
the, stereotyping bit, kindness. hear women haven't
weight trained, say, don't want get big, often. Sometimes do,
women helped weight train talked weight train say, don't want


get big, want get toned. think referring quality
muscularity. - hundred percent, - idea resting close rest, anytime
someone reaches grabs glass, muscles almost look like kind
twitching underneath skin. yet Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.
thing muscularity, resting tone, physiological basis, think readily
nerves communicating muscles. saying learning
engage muscles actively, resting tone muscularity can improve.
seen men women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - think
something takes upkeep, maintenance, develop muscle,
can just kind let coast. - think like everything key, requires upkeep,
know, user lose it, believe firmly, like think development
connections going harder maintenance connection. said,
still struggle day unnamed muscle groups, also,-
just certain areas harder brain whatever reason just develop
connection type level create extra strong contraction. think
proper dedication focus, go right say, calves one
areas don't necessarily great connection with, also obviously must not
care much 'cause don't put time effort create connection could.
think might happen is, know yeah, struggle there,
struggle comes disinterest, 'cause like, well screw it, calf knot
not going anything it. think put required effort in,
time repetitions will develop that, develop it, going
stick around lot longer not invested time all, not
requiring much that. mean, don't know, like mentioned, now
train, like, just, just part train now, like going hard,
trying really forcefully contract. not just moving weight, say
point point B, like trying contract weight range.
mindset try put everything doing, unless course focused
strength exercise just trying lift greater amount use muscles
together. goal inefficiency hypertrophy, really trying create
contraction, just part training. guess consistency's sake,
long training happening. get away training not happening
all, know, even there, probably another embarrassing admission probably, will
mindfully throughout day, even no weight hand, certain muscle


groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never

low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order

feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

People become intrigued interested. Like never, haven't tried since high
school. become interested just challenge it, become
almost distracted challenge, now like finding conditioning.
always think important part, sometimes got draw people show
might interested in. output effect it, just think
able blend some, still maintain strength training
exercise, mentioned, say kind push burpee,
anaerobic component going helpful, rather
just walking just jogging. Not say isn't effective means strict cardiac
conditioning, one ways centuries, it. just
think can blend it, becomes maybe little bit interesting
get crossover benefits, doesn't become segmented terms
trying do. - love idea bringing mental challenge
desire improve skill conditioning. not something thought
before, simply 'cause overlooked it, makes sense because, sister
reasonably fit, although always trying get bit more, always
asks me, take? a, don't believe supplements certain
people certain instances, keep telling her, know, it's, behaviors going
end, nutrition going greatest outsize positive effect. loves
things like dance classes things, kickboxing, kinds things which,
makes sense can hook somebody conditioning aspect skill
aspect kind trick cardio, speak terrific. Also
neuroscientist just say, forgive me, anytime engaging two
sets motor neurons, ones brain, upper motor neurons ones
spinal cord, anytime engaging upper motor neurons,
deliberate well controlled action, great thing brain

00:28:24 Tool: Mind-Muscle Connection, Cavaliere Cramp Contraction Test

terms brain longevity. So, now need incorporate actual skills
training. Going back weight training bit, one important things learned
you, years that, training increase muscle size, really
think, not much moving weights, challenging muscles. - Yeah. -
also heard friend, Ben Pakulski, well accomplished,


bodybuilder, now aspects fitness, teaches fitness, don't move
weights challenge muscles, unless trying power lift something sort,
not, immensely helpful. thing learned that,
combined idea certain muscles will grow better get stronger
much easily, maybe even will recover better ability contract
really hard. call Cavaliere test, least paraphrase,
instance, can, always bicep, isn't it? use calf bicep.
can flex bicep point hurts little bit, like almost feels like
cramp cramp, can flex calf point really cramps
little bit, almost feels like nodding up, pretty good indication going
able stimulate muscle well load movement
properly. feeling actually aim repetition, maybe even
throughout repetition. me, completely transformed results. was,
think maybe five/six years ago first heard you, body parts me,
lagged behind, thought maybe genetically weren't going work me,
immediately just started growing, right? getting stronger stronger,
thought really something much dedicated portion research
along with, collaboration another group try understand happening
upper motor neurons brain can engage muscles even more.
not just progressive overload putting pump muscle.
really mind muscle connection real thing comes predicting results
can get better it. forgive paraphrasing incredible content
around this, made tremendous difference number people
passed along to. can you, first all, arrive that?
hear mind-muscle connection, really heard first you.
arrive kind cramp test, Cavaliere test call it? always
weird people name things science, scientists can
name things. now officially Cavaliere test, whether not can
cramp muscle absence load, just flexing point hurts little
bit. good indication grow muscle well.
come this? - mean, honestly, something made sense me,
workouts, even young kid just starting out, always wanted know
working? lot people ask question think, like,
supposed work? lot, don't know ever noticed, like people


ask question, trained trainer, trainer's saying, well, just
this, exercise show it. say,
supposed work? supposed feel this, right? People, just
inherently ask question? lot people will. one that,
asked question. Not knew doing, just don't
know, wanted know supposed work. that,
start seek out, say, okay, well, bicep supposed
work, want make sure bicep's work. just sort
really like tweak movement make work feel uncomfortable,
get stronger contraction, knowing supposed job, wasn't PT
school learning, oh, well, flexion elbow brachial bias
bias' responsible supination. started to, learned components it,
wanted know bring arm curl, supposed job?
seek ways make happen better. able that,
feel stronger contraction. just, don't know it, just, no
visionary, just felt like knew going better muscle
trying grow stressed effectively. attempting
across different exercises, notice potentially curl
arm up, asking flex bicep position, couldn't
concentration curl, couldn't carry cable curl, shouldn't
really change, 'cause function still largely same, still elbow flexion,
still supination, not able there? sort clued
like, mind-muscle connection not just mind one muscle,
every exercise matters, varies exercise exercise. even
don't gain muscle size that, although think hard not to, especially
not used that, term like call muscularity,
difference, right? level sort resting tone muscle. improves
dramatically. can learn just start engage muscle better,
muscularity, resting tone muscle harder, attention,
alive. driven able connect better neurologically muscle
trying train. talked lot efficiency really trying
seek movements trying create hypertrophy. strength
goal, efficiency movement looking for. looking
muscles tied together work well efficiently, chest, shoulders, triceps,


get bar off chest bench press. not looking make
inefficient leverages chest, try grow chest bench press,
trying let whole package come together greater output.
trying go create muscle hypertrophy even muscularity talk about,
need seek ways make feel uncomfortable. don't feel discomfort,
something wrong. struggle day certain muscle groups
still that, even knowing trying work knowing goal
everything preaching here. difficult muscles certain people
certain muscles. mentioned, practice help.
become consistent

00:35:05 “Muscularity” & Resting Tone

deliberate trying do, result actually get. -
couple really couple points like delve further. First all, hunch
always muscle groups grew easily contract hardest
without any- first time Cavaliere test, got 10 10. give 10
10 scale. just like cinch, isolate muscles, cinch them, grow easily.
mean, certain body parts, don't want say ones, 'cause doesn't really
matter, always felt like just pushups, grow, muscles
far away muscles supposed involved pushups, even
though like think pushups correctly. tell not.
think genetic, sports played
younger. swam, played soccer, skateboard. later boxed.
muscles involved sports always easy engage later went
gym. guess perhaps call parents, kids lot dynamic activity,
seems like might good idea. thing issue muscularity.
glad brought up. are, imagine large number listeners
don't want get bigger. don't want take larger clothing size. don't
want take space. fact, like take less space,
want quality describing, that, oftentimes hear
the, stereotyping bit, kindness. hear women haven't
weight trained, say, don't want get big, often. Sometimes do,
women helped weight train talked weight train say, don't want


get big, want get toned. think referring quality
muscularity. - hundred percent, - idea resting close rest, anytime
someone reaches grabs glass, muscles almost look like kind
twitching underneath skin. yet Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.
thing muscularity, resting tone, physiological basis, think readily
nerves communicating muscles. saying learning
engage muscles actively, resting tone muscularity can improve.
seen men women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - think
something takes upkeep, maintenance, develop muscle,
can just kind let coast. - think like everything key, requires upkeep,
know, user lose it, believe firmly, like think development
connections going harder maintenance connection. said,
still struggle day unnamed muscle groups, also,-
just certain areas harder brain whatever reason just develop
connection type level create extra strong contraction. think
proper dedication focus, go right say, calves one
areas don't necessarily great connection with, also obviously must not
care much 'cause don't put time effort create connection could.
think might happen is, know yeah, struggle there,
struggle comes disinterest, 'cause like, well screw it, calf knot
not going anything it. think put required effort in,
time repetitions will develop that, develop it, going
stick around lot longer not invested time all, not
requiring much that. mean, don't know, like mentioned, now
train, like, just, just part train now, like going hard,
trying really forcefully contract. not just moving weight, say
point point B, like trying contract weight range.
mindset try put everything doing, unless course focused
strength exercise just trying lift greater amount use muscles
together. goal inefficiency hypertrophy, really trying create
contraction, just part training. guess consistency's sake,
long training happening. get away training not happening
all, know, even there, probably another embarrassing admission probably, will
mindfully throughout day, even no weight hand, certain muscle


groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

bodybuilder, now aspects fitness, teaches fitness, don't move
weights challenge muscles, unless trying power lift something sort,
not, immensely helpful. thing learned that,
combined idea certain muscles will grow better get stronger
much easily, maybe even will recover better ability contract
really hard. call Cavaliere test, least paraphrase,
instance, can, always bicep, isn't it? use calf bicep.
can flex bicep point hurts little bit, like almost feels like
cramp cramp, can flex calf point really cramps
little bit, almost feels like nodding up, pretty good indication going
able stimulate muscle well load movement
properly. feeling actually aim repetition, maybe even
throughout repetition. me, completely transformed results. was,
think maybe five/six years ago first heard you, body parts me,
lagged behind, thought maybe genetically weren't going work me,
immediately just started growing, right? getting stronger stronger,
thought really something much dedicated portion research
along with, collaboration another group try understand happening
upper motor neurons brain can engage muscles even more.
not just progressive overload putting pump muscle.
really mind muscle connection real thing comes predicting results
can get better it. forgive paraphrasing incredible content
around this, made tremendous difference number people
passed along to. can you, first all, arrive that?
hear mind-muscle connection, really heard first you.
arrive kind cramp test, Cavaliere test call it? always
weird people name things science, scientists can
name things. now officially Cavaliere test, whether not can
cramp muscle absence load, just flexing point hurts little
bit. good indication grow muscle well.
come this? - mean, honestly, something made sense me,
workouts, even young kid just starting out, always wanted know
working? lot people ask question think, like,
supposed work? lot, don't know ever noticed, like people


ask question, trained trainer, trainer's saying, well, just
this, exercise show it. say,
supposed work? supposed feel this, right? People, just
inherently ask question? lot people will. one that,
asked question. Not knew doing, just don't
know, wanted know supposed work. that,
start seek out, say, okay, well, bicep supposed
work, want make sure bicep's work. just sort
really like tweak movement make work feel uncomfortable,
get stronger contraction, knowing supposed job, wasn't PT
school learning, oh, well, flexion elbow brachial bias
bias' responsible supination. started to, learned components it,
wanted know bring arm curl, supposed job?
seek ways make happen better. able that,
feel stronger contraction. just, don't know it, just, no
visionary, just felt like knew going better muscle
trying grow stressed effectively. attempting
across different exercises, notice potentially curl
arm up, asking flex bicep position, couldn't
concentration curl, couldn't carry cable curl, shouldn't
really change, 'cause function still largely same, still elbow flexion,
still supination, not able there? sort clued
like, mind-muscle connection not just mind one muscle,
every exercise matters, varies exercise exercise. even
don't gain muscle size that, although think hard not to, especially
not used that, term like call muscularity,
difference, right? level sort resting tone muscle. improves
dramatically. can learn just start engage muscle better,
muscularity, resting tone muscle harder, attention,
alive. driven able connect better neurologically muscle
trying train. talked lot efficiency really trying
seek movements trying create hypertrophy. strength
goal, efficiency movement looking for. looking
muscles tied together work well efficiently, chest, shoulders, triceps,


get bar off chest bench press. not looking make
inefficient leverages chest, try grow chest bench press,
trying let whole package come together greater output.
trying go create muscle hypertrophy even muscularity talk about,
need seek ways make feel uncomfortable. don't feel discomfort,
something wrong. struggle day certain muscle groups
still that, even knowing trying work knowing goal
everything preaching here. difficult muscles certain people
certain muscles. mentioned, practice help.
become consistent

00:35:05 “Muscularity” & Resting Tone

deliberate trying do, result actually get. -
couple really couple points like delve further. First all, hunch
always muscle groups grew easily contract hardest
without any- first time Cavaliere test, got 10 10. give 10
10 scale. just like cinch, isolate muscles, cinch them, grow easily.
mean, certain body parts, don't want say ones, 'cause doesn't really
matter, always felt like just pushups, grow, muscles
far away muscles supposed involved pushups, even
though like think pushups correctly. tell not.
think genetic, sports played
younger. swam, played soccer, skateboard. later boxed.
muscles involved sports always easy engage later went
gym. guess perhaps call parents, kids lot dynamic activity,
seems like might good idea. thing issue muscularity.
glad brought up. are, imagine large number listeners
don't want get bigger. don't want take larger clothing size. don't
want take space. fact, like take less space,
want quality describing, that, oftentimes hear
the, stereotyping bit, kindness. hear women haven't
weight trained, say, don't want get big, often. Sometimes do,
women helped weight train talked weight train say, don't want


get big, want get toned. think referring quality
muscularity. - hundred percent, - idea resting close rest, anytime
someone reaches grabs glass, muscles almost look like kind
twitching underneath skin. yet Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.
thing muscularity, resting tone, physiological basis, think readily
nerves communicating muscles. saying learning
engage muscles actively, resting tone muscularity can improve.
seen men women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - think
something takes upkeep, maintenance, develop muscle,
can just kind let coast. - think like everything key, requires upkeep,
know, user lose it, believe firmly, like think development
connections going harder maintenance connection. said,
still struggle day unnamed muscle groups, also,-
just certain areas harder brain whatever reason just develop
connection type level create extra strong contraction. think
proper dedication focus, go right say, calves one
areas don't necessarily great connection with, also obviously must not
care much 'cause don't put time effort create connection could.
think might happen is, know yeah, struggle there,
struggle comes disinterest, 'cause like, well screw it, calf knot
not going anything it. think put required effort in,
time repetitions will develop that, develop it, going
stick around lot longer not invested time all, not
requiring much that. mean, don't know, like mentioned, now
train, like, just, just part train now, like going hard,
trying really forcefully contract. not just moving weight, say
point point B, like trying contract weight range.
mindset try put everything doing, unless course focused
strength exercise just trying lift greater amount use muscles
together. goal inefficiency hypertrophy, really trying create
contraction, just part training. guess consistency's sake,
long training happening. get away training not happening
all, know, even there, probably another embarrassing admission probably, will
mindfully throughout day, even no weight hand, certain muscle


groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.

hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot

shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion

foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque

feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,

generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think

researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

ask question, trained trainer, trainer's saying, well, just
this, exercise show it. say,
supposed work? supposed feel this, right? People, just
inherently ask question? lot people will. one that,
asked question. Not knew doing, just don't
know, wanted know supposed work. that,
start seek out, say, okay, well, bicep supposed
work, want make sure bicep's work. just sort
really like tweak movement make work feel uncomfortable,

visionary, just felt like knew going better muscle
trying grow stressed effectively. attempting
across different exercises, notice potentially curl
arm up, asking flex bicep position, couldn't
concentration curl, couldn't carry cable curl, shouldn't
really change, 'cause function still largely same, still elbow flexion,
still supination, not able there? sort clued
like, mind-muscle connection not just mind one muscle,
every exercise matters, varies exercise exercise. even
don't gain muscle size that, although think hard not to, especially
not used that, term like call muscularity,

become consistent

00:35:05 “Muscularity” & Resting Tone

deliberate trying do, result actually get. -
couple really couple points like delve further. First all, hunch
always muscle groups grew easily contract hardest
without any- first time Cavaliere test, got 10 10. give 10
10 scale. just like cinch, isolate muscles, cinch them, grow easily.
mean, certain body parts, don't want say ones, 'cause doesn't really
matter, always felt like just pushups, grow, muscles
far away muscles supposed involved pushups, even
though like think pushups correctly. tell not.
think genetic, sports played
younger. swam, played soccer, skateboard. later boxed.
muscles involved sports always easy engage later went
gym. guess perhaps call parents, kids lot dynamic activity,
seems like might good idea. thing issue muscularity.
glad brought up. are, imagine large number listeners
don't want get bigger. don't want take larger clothing size. don't
want take space. fact, like take less space,
want quality describing, that, oftentimes hear
the, stereotyping bit, kindness. hear women haven't
weight trained, say, don't want get big, often. Sometimes do,
women helped weight train talked weight train say, don't want


get big, want get toned. think referring quality
muscularity. - hundred percent, - idea resting close rest, anytime
someone reaches grabs glass, muscles almost look like kind
twitching underneath skin. yet Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.
thing muscularity, resting tone, physiological basis, think readily
nerves communicating muscles. saying learning
engage muscles actively, resting tone muscularity can improve.
seen men women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - think
something takes upkeep, maintenance, develop muscle,
can just kind let coast. - think like everything key, requires upkeep,
know, user lose it, believe firmly, like think development
connections going harder maintenance connection. said,
still struggle day unnamed muscle groups, also,-
just certain areas harder brain whatever reason just develop
connection type level create extra strong contraction. think
proper dedication focus, go right say, calves one
areas don't necessarily great connection with, also obviously must not
care much 'cause don't put time effort create connection could.
think might happen is, know yeah, struggle there,
struggle comes disinterest, 'cause like, well screw it, calf knot
not going anything it. think put required effort in,
time repetitions will develop that, develop it, going
stick around lot longer not invested time all, not
requiring much that. mean, don't know, like mentioned, now
train, like, just, just part train now, like going hard,
trying really forcefully contract. not just moving weight, say
point point B, like trying contract weight range.
mindset try put everything doing, unless course focused
strength exercise just trying lift greater amount use muscles
together. goal inefficiency hypertrophy, really trying create
contraction, just part training. guess consistency's sake,
long training happening. get away training not happening
all, know, even there, probably another embarrassing admission probably, will
mindfully throughout day, even no weight hand, certain muscle


groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

get bar off chest bench press. not looking make
inefficient leverages chest, try grow chest bench press,
trying let whole package come together greater output.
trying go create muscle hypertrophy even muscularity talk about,
need seek ways make feel uncomfortable. don't feel discomfort,
something wrong. struggle day certain muscle groups
still that, even knowing trying work knowing goal
everything preaching here. difficult muscles certain people
certain muscles. mentioned, practice help.
become consistent

00:35:05 “Muscularity” & Resting Tone

deliberate trying do, result actually get. -
couple really couple points like delve further. First all, hunch
always muscle groups grew easily contract hardest
without any- first time Cavaliere test, got 10 10. give 10
10 scale. just like cinch, isolate muscles, cinch them, grow easily.
mean, certain body parts, don't want say ones, 'cause doesn't really
matter, always felt like just pushups, grow, muscles
far away muscles supposed involved pushups, even
though like think pushups correctly. tell not.
think genetic, sports played
younger. swam, played soccer, skateboard. later boxed.
muscles involved sports always easy engage later went
gym. guess perhaps call parents, kids lot dynamic activity,
seems like might good idea. thing issue muscularity.
glad brought up. are, imagine large number listeners
don't want get bigger. don't want take larger clothing size. don't
want take space. fact, like take less space,
want quality describing, that, oftentimes hear
the, stereotyping bit, kindness. hear women haven't
weight trained, say, don't want get big, often. Sometimes do,
women helped weight train talked weight train say, don't want


get big, want get toned. think referring quality
muscularity. - hundred percent, - idea resting close rest, anytime
someone reaches grabs glass, muscles almost look like kind
twitching underneath skin. yet Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.
thing muscularity, resting tone, physiological basis, think readily
nerves communicating muscles. saying learning
engage muscles actively, resting tone muscularity can improve.
seen men women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - think
something takes upkeep, maintenance, develop muscle,
can just kind let coast. - think like everything key, requires upkeep,
know, user lose it, believe firmly, like think development
connections going harder maintenance connection. said,
still struggle day unnamed muscle groups, also,-
just certain areas harder brain whatever reason just develop
connection type level create extra strong contraction. think
proper dedication focus, go right say, calves one
areas don't necessarily great connection with, also obviously must not
care much 'cause don't put time effort create connection could.
think might happen is, know yeah, struggle there,
struggle comes disinterest, 'cause like, well screw it, calf knot
not going anything it. think put required effort in,
time repetitions will develop that, develop it, going
stick around lot longer not invested time all, not
requiring much that. mean, don't know, like mentioned, now
train, like, just, just part train now, like going hard,
trying really forcefully contract. not just moving weight, say
point point B, like trying contract weight range.
mindset try put everything doing, unless course focused
strength exercise just trying lift greater amount use muscles
together. goal inefficiency hypertrophy, really trying create
contraction, just part training. guess consistency's sake,
long training happening. get away training not happening
all, know, even there, probably another embarrassing admission probably, will
mindfully throughout day, even no weight hand, certain muscle


groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle

Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether

like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural

us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

get big, want get toned. think referring quality
muscularity. - hundred percent, - idea resting close rest, anytime
someone reaches grabs glass, muscles almost look like kind
twitching underneath skin. yet Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin.
thing muscularity, resting tone, physiological basis, think readily
nerves communicating muscles. saying learning
engage muscles actively, resting tone muscularity can improve.
seen men women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - think
something takes upkeep, maintenance, develop muscle,
can just kind let coast. - think like everything key, requires upkeep,
know, user lose it, believe firmly, like think development
connections going harder maintenance connection. said,
still struggle day unnamed muscle groups, also,-
just certain areas harder brain whatever reason just develop
connection type level create extra strong contraction. think
proper dedication focus, go right say, calves one
areas don't necessarily great connection with, also obviously must not
care much 'cause don't put time effort create connection could.
think might happen is, know yeah, struggle there,
struggle comes disinterest, 'cause like, well screw it, calf knot
not going anything it. think put required effort in,
time repetitions will develop that, develop it, going
stick around lot longer not invested time all, not
requiring much that. mean, don't know, like mentioned, now
train, like, just, just part train now, like going hard,
trying really forcefully contract. not just moving weight, say
point point B, like trying contract weight range.
mindset try put everything doing, unless course focused
strength exercise just trying lift greater amount use muscles
together. goal inefficiency hypertrophy, really trying create
contraction, just part training. guess consistency's sake,
long training happening. get away training not happening
all, know, even there, probably another embarrassing admission probably, will
mindfully throughout day, even no weight hand, certain muscle


groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

groups, whether abs arm shoulders something,
something just sort engage muscles. think sort
inane practice actually helps time go back gym. just kind keep
connection going. - Well, certainly obeys rules neuroplasticity. know
fire together wired together mantra, words colleague, Carla Shatz,
hold true aspects neural function, including nerve muscle. flexing
throughout day deliberate isolation contracting muscle throughout day
without question engaging neuroplasticity. fewer
repetitions, going get less engagement nerve muscle connection. can
say smile confidence because, one first things
neuroscience students learn neuromuscular junction, 'cause really
simple example times nerve fires gets muscle contract,
stronger connection get, receptors brought there, et cetera, et cetera,
whole bunch mechanisms topic another podcast. basically practice
throughout day makes total sense works. - Yeah, no, believe me,
no science behind terms application it. when, catch
time time. definitely something easily done
discreetly wind doing. actually, think recent video talk
growing arms just improving connection. Not connection
applying load resistance significant create overload growth,
development connection take back gym
effective level takes every exercise makes effective. -
like sharpening blade, speak.

00:41:31 Tool: Muscle Recovery & Soreness, Grip Strength

Yeah, certainly obeys laws nerve muscle physiology. Wanted just touch
couple things. goal challenge muscles, one dividing body into,
say, three four day week split so, maybe six, know
muscle ready challenged again? Again, heard, okay, every 48 hours
protein synthesis increases get drops off.
frankly, train legs hard, can get stronger workout workout, least
better way, workout workout, leg workout leg workout, training
every five eight days. train often, get worse. whatever 48 hour


72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

72 hour thing is, somehow legs don't obey that, maybe something else wrong
me, sure many things else wrong me, assess
recovery local level, meaning level muscles, talk
soreness, getting better, stronger, repetitions, et cetera?
systemic level, level nervous system. love tell us
tool that, again, learned you, actually using physical scale,
turns that, will let tell tool is, tool also actively used
assessing cognitive decline, cognitive maintenance, cognitive function people
Alzheimer's dementia. - makes total sense. Makes total sense.
regarding first part question, kind dictate muscle's
recovered? think experiencing totally real, different
muscles recover different rates. always fascinated concept.
talked internally team, like, feel like really need holy
grail training, going able crack code individual basis,
muscle recovered, going dictate training schedule.
fact might bicep trained via pulling workout, regular
bicep dedicated workout, forget split moment. may bicep able
trained, can trained next day. next day,
maybe need day off that. like, can vary person person
sure, can vary muscle muscle person course time
mentioned, 'cause systemic recovery going impact muscles
anyway, say systemically recovering, every muscle going
recovery rate. think fascinating that, talked
like train week, have, like way mind looks training, well,
case biceps, bicep slave rest training split.
like, well, also end every eighth day whatever,
might respond better something much frequently? legs
also thrown mix. Mike Menzer concept like, train
one set done 14 days. mean, variability muscle groups
linking together. think coming back using muscle soreness
guideline that, one tools terms local level.
know don't really have, able measure, say CPK levels inside
muscle amazing, local level see recovered muscle is,
becomes fairly invasive, least knowledge, becomes fairly invasive.


tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

tools? mean, think basic level, one people can
relate easily identify, use guideline. training
really sore, probably not great idea. probably good indication
muscle's not recovered, least hearing saying might
comfort person say, yeah, possible not recovered. Just
48 hours recommendation. just research points muscle
protein synthesis needing restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe not necessarily
yet. muscle not yet. really interesting stuff,
far systemic recovery, think lot ways people talk resting
heart rate measured morning, different kinds core temperature things
like might become altered state non recovery. grip strength
much tied performance recovery. Mets, used
actually take grip strength measurements baseline spring training time.
Now, obviously baseball player, gripping bat, pitcher, gripping
ball like- good grip strength important, noticed somebody
weak grip, just good focal point specialized training component the... -
use every day guys? - No, do, spring training,
sort baseline entry level measurement. measure throughout
season, maybe every two weeks three weeks. idea
manage recover, measure recovery. just gave away, determine overall
recovery, grip strength pretty highly correlated. found one
scales, old fashioned bathroom scales like bathroom beyond,
whatever can get, way, almost impossible, believe Jesse
searching last scale put video. almost couldn't find one, 'cause
everything like digital everything. looking old fashioned dial controls. -
like old Macintosh computers. huge market old phones. Kids
keep phones now. 30 years, lame phone now will worth lot money. -
It'll worth lot. So, wound finding one, great tool just squeezing
scale hands seeing type output get. think
can relate just visualize, imagine last time sick,
you, just try this, next time wake morning, first wake
morning, still groggy. Try squeeze hand, try make fist
hard can. going sit angry fist won't contract
hard know can. don't ability just create output.


state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content

exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

state, still sleepy, still fatigued, not even awake
whole level point. Well, still actual phenomenon happens that,
lack recovery, lack wakefulness, whatever want say going lead
decreased output there. start measure daily basis, can
get pretty good sense at. think people start see drop
off 10% so, even greater grip output, really skip gym
day. don't think much going going
beneficial, even day train legs whatever day is. - love tool,
simple, low cost, can find scale. guess also find one
grippers that, non quantitative way, better
scale actually measure hard can squeeze thing given
time day. draws mind, just little neuroscience factor, world circadian
neurobiology, one consistent findings middle nighttime,
wake people say, test. laboratory use different
apparatus, essentially thing. middle night grip strength
very, low. mid-morning, grip strength high, body temperature
goes afternoon, grip strength goes higher higher higher,
drops off. circadian rhythm grip temperature. probably want
less time day going use it. think
brilliant simplicity directness upper motor neurons, 'cause
really assessing ability. Again, ability contract muscles
hard. can't that, not going get effective workout. - Yeah,
also, mean, certainly sophisticated tools too. PT, hand grip
dynamometers, can measure one side time too. not really, getting little
bit blinded fact hands squeezing scale don't get really
left right comparison. even level, give little bit detail,
comes cost, pretty expensive devices. it's, listen,
athlete, $200, $300 cost one well worth
added investment. - sure listeners will want one too, 'cause
lot tech geeks there, not tech industry geeks, people like tech gear.
called again? - hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. -
Dynamometer. Said Jeff great East Coast accent,

00:50:39 Sleep & Sleep Position



terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,

leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got

20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

terrible botched West Coast version. Thank you, well, put
show notes also. Now think recovery key, always hear sleep. grow
sleep incidentally brain, stimulate learning awake
obviously, reordering neural connections happens sleep. sleep
way get smarter, provided also learning part. sleep's
way get stronger provided also training part. really,
put interesting content years terms even sleep position. One
major changes made sleep behavior not sheets tucked
end bed. tell you, profound impact several things. First
all, feet always bane existence, broke bunch
skateboarding. noticed run, get shin splints. started
notice feet sort of, PT, kind floppy, pointing
toes slightly time rest. realized based listening previously,
sheets wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - thing
hotels. started releasing sheets end bed, also started
tibialis work. Front Shin's work essentially, changed everything. back pain
running shin splints disappeared, posture improved, although audience
will tell still needs improvement. always five 10 people that-
actually chairs sent mailing address. nice chairs, right? trying
there. fascinating, right? position one sleeps in, fortunately
never shoulder issues knock wood, maybe just talk us
little bit sleep sleep position sake waking position movement.
'Cause this, think unique powerful way think sleep.
podcast done lot episodes keeping room cool, getting sunlight
eyes, et cetera, get sleep. talked physically, positions
might better sleep in. please, please enrich us. - mean, first all,
people's opinions type content that, sleep position
comfortable ensure sleeping. Oh great, understand want
sleep, goal put head pillow, actually fall asleep
wake morning not know hell happened, unless dream.
know beyond that, certainly physical components sleep.
lot times people will wake say like can incur pretty serious injuries
sleep. People will wake like shoulder not bother all,


humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never

low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order

feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

humming next day even weeks after, one sleep position
put in, prolonged way. happened deep sleep, even
discomfort. can actually damage. understandable
body can incur strain stress sleeping wrong way. One
things say right off bat is, sleeping stomach just doesn't really many
benefits. putting position is, depending upon orientation
mattress many pillows using, basically putting
excessive extension lumbar spine, people, isn't good,
disc patient, guess might helpful, relocating disc. mean,
part, hands usually not sides,
arms, got sort internal rotation elevation head.
just not great position. also crank neck one side
order breathe, going face down, straight pillow.
skip one. people total belly sleepers. just say,
listen, don't think helpful, long term way sleep. Try adopt
different position. Sleeping side oftentimes is, also brought along that,
legs knees coming towards chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen,
enough day. - right now. - don't need
another 10 hours eight hours something night like that. just reinforcing,
said too, say trained day, just reinforcing muscle
shortening overnight. body healing trying create changes
body. One reasons recommend stretching static stretching prior
going bed, lot people don't really want point, 'cause take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon many muscles stretch.
good sort try establish just longer length temporarily prior going state
going not moving recovering creating new changes
muscle. So, kind of, don't say doesn't rule side sleeper. side sleeper
very, helpful somebody apnea conditions. again,
not nothing approach, something need pay attention to.
back, like talking feet wedged
underneath tight sheets end bed. us, unless consciously
pulling up, don't prefer beds really loose sheets end
bed. - hard make bed morning. - like going want
tight. Well, saying experienced, going


prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never

make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

prolonged plant reflection, going likely lead shorter calves time
lacking length long period time just
loosened sheets allowed feet just hang are. Now,
resting position ankle not endorse reflection, going still plain
reflection, not driven pulled position. think
happens actually people get uncomfortable way, even sleep will shift
away turning either onto side stomach. definitely
impact body position sleep figuring best way can still sleep
course, get rest, mindful eye towards body
choose one least abrasive body way go. -
terrific, again, really helped big believer based good science
Stanford elsewhere much can nasal breathers sleep,
probably be. don't know done content yet taping mouth
shut medical tape, know benefits nasal breathing sleep
pretty tremendous, takes little bit training people do, training
simple.

00:57:24 Active (Dynamic) vs. Passive Stretching, Timing & Healing Muscle

little piece medical tape. again, topic another time. glad
mentioned stretching, going ask stretching little bit later, talk
stretching. best time stretch particular types results?
maybe define different types stretching. just mentioned
little bit of, call it, light stretching or? completely naive stretching.
let just say, can think stretching hold stretch really try
"lengthen" air quotes folks, don't want PTs jumping over. don't know
is, nutrition PTs online really, got pitchforks hands.
Academics... - recent evolution, think. not nutrition much,
PTs become little bit angry days. - see, well, always say feelings
powerlessness comes aggression. Remember folks. case,
stretching trying consciously "lengthen," air quotes, muscle
not yanking limb bobbing down. Maybe define different
types stretching people, maybe give us rough guidelines not
cold warm, training, training, et cetera. - So, yeah,


obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

obviously lot different types stretching get even P F
stretching things little bit niche. general, two basic forms
stretching active stretching passive stretching, dynamic work.
passive stretching done goal trying create increase
flexibility muscle. whether actually increasing length muscle,
increasing the- decreasing resistance muscle
want stay certain level flexibility. can sort take breaks off
allow muscle allow us range motion, inherently increasing
flexibility without necessarily increase length muscle. usually
done time far away workout, shown type
stretching done prior activity, like structured activity like lifting,
little bit less structured, like competing sport spontaneous type
way, period recalibration needed this,
disrupting length tension relationship muscle causes not
necessarily able rely these, talked before, stored motor engrams
mind terms of, pattern swing golf club, say. now
introducing little bit flexibility, added flexibility, range, stretching
before, takes maybe whole two three match again. Oh,
trying do, golf swinging thing remembered again, like not
remembering every component, like bend right wrist back 10 degrees,
bend elbow break, like body stores
patterns motor efficiency. start matching stored pattern
feeling new increased range, can impair performance.
again, happen even gym workout talking first,
second set, third set, maybe repercussions aren't big, 'cause just
extra sets. performance, screw first three rounds, playing
PJ tour shoot six three, done. think matters
there. far dynamic, relegate mentioned, sort towards end
day not going impact performance, even maybe
additional benefit creating feeling length increase decrease
resistance length time know body going try tend heal
heal shorter, never longer, heal shorter. can introduce little bit
extra length decreased resistance length, better time it. think
promotes better recovery. want to... - Sorry interrupt, stretching later


day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

day, intrigued concept heal shorter. part healing
recovery process means shortening muscles. tensing sleep. -
Yes, yeah. - elaborate just bit sorry break flow,
continue... - No, just basically, shown that, repair
process, muscular repair from, say strength training day, repair
process usually results muscle slightly shorter rather increased length.
just, muscles prefer sort ratchet way contraction,
maintain comfortable length tension relationship. sleeping,
tends air side shorter rather longer, ideally don't really want
that. want maintain much length length, actually
leverage. muscle leverage contract. way
contracted, really can't obviously know generate much force muscle
already maximally contracted. think want something we, whatever
can, whatever little weapons arsenal allow us prior
sleep. again, just making conscious choice time day
makes little bit sense. Dynamic stretching really not done purpose
trying create type feeling act increasing potential length said
muscle, readiness muscle perform. increasing
exploring ends range motion dynamic way not hanging
disrupting length tension relationship just sort touching ends
barriers feel movement again, feels looser, feels
ready. obviously time warming blood flow, benefits get
just warming general. like series probably seen bunch
times like leg swings butt kicks lunge, walking lunges types of- -
Toe touches. - Toe touches, kind drills, active stretching drills
lunging rotations upper body try get thoracic spine involved
too. drills people will prior training excitatory
terms just nervous system also helpful just general warm body
'cause blood flow. muscle readiness standpoint not impairing
performance time exploring increased ranges 'cause know
first toe touch not high last toe touch do. - doesn't
even include toe. - shin touch. - touch attempt. - like going
improve subsequent rep think people actually, can
see those, actual changes rep one rep seven, just feel ready, feel


alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

alert ready go workout. dynamic type stretching
mentioned earlier sort increase warm focus. think
try days. try little bit alert fact that,
body's not ready. working Antonio Brown remember like
spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes dynamic work. never seen anybody spend
long dynamic work. like said, just didn't feel right ready go
unless lot that. mean dynamic stretching routine workout
everybody. crazy much did. - pro athletes amazing.
great fortune working improving abilities. can
imagine 'cause also imagine pretty strong gym also. - mean, always
amazes guys make level no matter sport do.
gifted everything. Like David Wright used make laugh time Mets
no matter I, Ping pong, like anything hand-eye
coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. remember hadn't done lot jump
rope think jump rope's one best things conditioning
standpoint. actually fairly interesting, not just, not harsh joints even
though ballistic move wasn't- admit, listens this, going
want kill me, better jump roping. One things
do. gave five days completely blew water
point never keep anymore. made look effortless.
like athlete someone comes out. No matter pick up,
good it. think see guys like gym like strength
levels tend pretty damn good abilities, coordination, everything
just tends sort good level. sort amazes me. guys can
go pick golf club go shoot 72 never really played. just
naturally good whatever do. - Yeah, couple, smiling 'cause
couple really close friends number years several decades
SEAL teams. don't know skill level everything high
describing athletes level competitiveness beyond. ocean swam
one, no chance going right swim Pat ever, ever. actually goes
back forth sometimes just check me, appreciate. Thank Pat.
haven't drowned yet. addition that, play horseshoes like
switch just flips on, like going murder me. course nice guy,
right? general, tend nice. level competitiveness kind


unreal. selected it. - trying beat not even trying
beat you. - right, not even competition. - not even there. -
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

Yeah, exactly.

01:07:23 Tool: Jumping Rope

Thank you. Now won't feel bad worse. true, remarkable thing. glad
mentioned jump roping. used skip rope warmup boxing, like three minute
rounds something like that. glad brought skipping rope
something obviously cardiovascular component, conditioning
component, timing kind interesting, right? frustrating
don't get especially whips air using proper rope. just
curious just give us quick skipping rope 101. like see people
jumping feet toes? link video one missed it.
like see people high knees? like people basically like shuffling?
want see people double Dutch? want see people
time? - maybe not double Dutch, above. mean, think
cool thing it, right? Like sort master skill 'cause
us, first jump two feet going together challenge. 'Cause just got
time rope, got time jump get bored often
humans, get bored can want take new challenges
becomes one leg time becomes side side hops, right?
things beneficial believe neurologically enhancing ability skill
whole also just believer training three planes.
like just straight versus now can frontal plane side side motion
can even small little twists core screws call them. requires
different, know better requires different neurological
patterns able coordinate changing orientation
body space. not just changing exercise changing body
interprets exercise happening body space. love
whatever people wind doing, amazed people, just started
following young woman Instagram like, give plug out, think
like @anna.skips something ridiculous. Like watch like
mesmerized can rope. like extremely athletic endeavor


believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

believe gets level speed precision the- think
one goals want able feeling
almost effortlessly dancing without rope. Like just bouncing off ball
foot. important skill learn whether go back run even
even jog, right? Just like casual running, learning land important. One
drills people try like, try jump heels. just stand up, pull
toes off ground, right? just jump heels land heels.
feel jaw. literally feel jaw rattle land heels.
no shock absorption capabilities heels. Meantime, lot people
land heels lot run just, body's not built absorb
forces like ball foot could. really built spring. foot a,
physical therapist, foot always one amazing, talk
bad feet flat feet looks like got flippers took shoes off. Like
wearing scuba fins. no- no adaptability foot surface.
completely caved flattened like that, job foot
adaptable. Well, maybe adaptability floppy,
time point critical junction going step
need able push off foot actually changes midfoot
become rigid lever call it. going mobile adapter rigid
lever. rigid lever literally locks metatarsal joint become solid
can push off leverage. lack capability, stresses
supposed born foot, go ankle, knee, hip,
low back. learning land start train body experience ground
reaction forces right way critical function disability
kinetic chain jumping rope like one best ways learn that. -
Great. jump rope love morning get sunlight eyes.
actually protocol picked Tim Ferris mentioned 'cause listeners
podcast know like broken record get sunlight eyes even cloud
cover just sets sleep rhythms waking rhythms yada yada on.
sometimes it'd kind boring people want get off phone.
jumping rope also just great way wake up. jumping rope can cardio
workout, 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. sort hybrid
talking like, not necessarily dropping ground
burpees, just look athletic endeavor


coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

coordination involved just simply walking jogging. - Yeah, not much
equipment requirement. minimal cost. even use rope something
you... - even instruct people use no rope just pretend just move
arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - never going hit rope good
time, never going know wrong,

01:12:56 Internal & External Rotation, Upright Row vs. High Pull

least can move get benefits feet. -
love it, love it. told sitting today wasn't going
focus specific exercises wealth incredible content
put people just put YouTube elsewhere arrive
proper way chin dip, whatever purpose. one exercise one
particular motion like discuss moment believe learning
cautionary note one reasons maintained steady
training 30 years no major injury knock wood upright row. One
thing whether weight train not. - censor podcast? mean
censoring, beep not? - do. get beef this? - No.
know what, always get beef social media platform put out.
like, no, guess some, get it, fully prepared defend myself. -
reason asking this. never really cared much upright rows not
exercise tend do. one thing apparent colleagues, every child
see, every adult see almost everybody inward rotation now. folks
think stay, think learned also, stand straight
just point thumbs out, like thumbs hands pointing
thumbs straight out, ideally go straight out. people thumbs
going pointing toward one another people starting look
somewhere non human primate melted candle. Bent hips, et
cetera, much sitting, sitting, inward rotation, learned
upright row compromises important aspects shoulder
mechanics actually sort dangerous movement ways. sure
safe way people it. always made point now basis
advice A, not upright rows, wasn't really strive
external rotation things like bench dips, number different things. Whenever


can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

can try go external rotation provided without looking like idiot walking
around palms facing outward. Please tell us internal external rotation.
upright row one aspect that, important not just weight training,
terms posture mechanics not looking like melted candle
partially melted candle. - actually love it. happy talk cause love
shoulder joint. think PTs tend fall love certain areas shoulder
one cool areas me, like foot like, shoulder
mobility body joint, also got least stability, right? always
trade off mobility stability. stability comes certain muscle groups
101 muscle group actually externally rotates shoulder
going rotator cuff, okay. unless devoted training
external rotation exercises going externally rotate shoulder, not
training function. easy us everyday life especially aren't
training not ever really undergo stresses beneficial
counteracting happens freely naturally, internal rotation.
think imbalance created just nature live lives, internal
rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. need address it.
reason need address need normalize
biomechanics shoulder want long term health. one functions
shoulder raise arm head. internally
rotated position, going higher likelihood creating stress inside
joint. Funny thing talked PT brethren can somewhat angry
days, don't know happened, fairly angry. want discredit
existence something like shoulder impingement, don't know how, mean,
certain studies, look, read studies studies will say one thing one day
potentially conflict entirely different direction. studies will point non-
existence shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, thankfully digital motion x-
rays will literally show impingement occur real time, real function.
one limitations off tangent here, like types x-rays type
fluoroscopy nowadays, like gives us insight never
'cause taking static x-rays someone laying table. Well, want
see happens actually raise arm head function
tools now exist that. see problems occurring order get
normal mechanics free joint maximally inside need externally rotate


raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

raise arm up. muscles aren't firing not necessarily
strong internal rotation bias pulls in, asking trouble every time
that. Well, exercise literally putting elevation internal rotation.
walk PT office someone said, "I think got
impingement, will diagnose him?" test called Hawkins Kennedy Test.
put position know not visible point
podcast, put position arm elevated
hand pretty much chin pushing downward create internal
shoulder rotation. Pretty much exact position holding bar
upright row. will say, well, just don't go high going level
chest, still internally rotated position. thing think frustrates
exercise alternative alternative
thing terms helping muscles grow simply fixing biomechanics
exercise just allowing hands go higher elbows. instead
elbows higher hand drives internal rotation, elbow
lower hand, hand higher here, external rotation.
something called high pull still get abduction arm still get
benefits shoulders, delts traps without undergo
stresses come somewhat awkward movement upright row.
- listening, put link short clip looks like.
basically Jeff tell describing incorrectly correctly. Jeff
taking two thumbs pointing behind you, elbows kind near chin
pointing behind like, oh, headed way. Like somebody directing airplane, like
come back, come back back. forget call that. think called
semaphorin, action like direct planes something flags
whatever. Someone will, course tell wrong too, say
things like told correct answer is. case,
replaces upright row probably number important things well. -
Well, again, listen, without naming names programs anything like that. got
involved in, got involved Athlean-X, first online presence,
very, very, popular program just fun wanted
PT, nerdy things do, wanted evaluate workout structure. went
looked every rep course week. something like 890
repetitions something done zero dedicated external rotation


shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

shoulder. think it, mean, again, popular program
done lot people. no focus all, no dedicated focus towards creating
balance action predominant. remember, not just sit
bad posture, fact chest can internally rotate, latch can internally
rotate, like muscle, big muscles participate things every
day will internally rotate shoulder. weapons external
rotation little rotator cuff muscles three actually three four.
job sort actively consciously train really boring
exercises, right? Like seen band, anchor band pole,
stand band opposite hand. anchored pole left side
got band right side see people kind rotate
hand towards back. Again, kind saying lower elevation
taking back hand trying point somebody behind me. Well,
one ways train muscle. just one function shoulder, external
rotation shoulder need it. again, not somebody
external rotation work absorb upright row better? Probably,
elevated arm, probably little bit contribution
rotator cuff one functions centralize head
humorous inside glenoid, capsule. rises up, stays central
opposed migrating deltoid likes pull up. rotator cuff
ability counteract upward pull del can maintain healthy
relationship overhead movement. just realizing function gained
exercises, probably dedicate time there, upright
row might better absorbed person 'cause little bit strength.
again, why? exercise thing
trying muscularly, build muscles affects, wouldn't just
can still see actually pick repetitions external rotation?
getting none harm benefits. see zero reason ever
upright row people will argue, way argue that, done 30
years never hurt myself. always say yet, yet. Like, listen, goal not
hurt ever. even you, sort like championship game. might play
game life, lose lost. get end
record books, still lost. even game life lost, don't care
30 years, no pain, still no pain giving


option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

option going give results exercise seeking.
exercise without possibility bad
outcome come it. get little bit defensive move, feel like like,
that? - No, makes say, able train long period
time feel good. proud say don't kind genetics like
don't lot impressive athletes family tree anything. fit
individuals less fit individuals, really believe putting work
consistently time. often can wake not pain better.
think external rotation often possible good.

01:24:27 Back Pain Relief & Medial Glutes, Body Pain & Origins

actually good friend yoga teacher told also problem
yogis, downward dog stuff. listening, can think inward
rotation like thumbs down. Just think thumbs rotation isn't bad less
thumbs thumbs external rotation. just listening, maybe
gives visual. exercise can external rotation better seems
average. love chat just little bit biomechanics,
personal thing again, content really helped solve me. One thought
lower back pain, sciatica badly trips Work trips years ago
lot international travel. mean, hard stand
sometimes. mean like excruciating pain. didn't want take medication, didn't want
back surgery. end, turns wasn't back injury all. one things
helped fix just learning thing called medial glute.
video said fixed back pain quite accurately say back
pain isn't really back all. exercise allowed try
exercise lay side essentially pointing toe top toe down,
almost like pointing toe slowly lift leg pointing
toe down. Maybe got it... - No, got good. - holding that,
muscle sort sits top glute kind peaks every while.
can feel thumb, think push back it. bit
creating mind muscle link proprioception, actual feeling
muscle literally limb, know based neural circuits movement,
enhances contractibility muscle. like touch bicep, literally can


contract strongly. makes total sense based neuromuscular
physiology. repeatedly. started hotel room
pain started disappear. came back afternoon
afternoon. something three four days lo behold
back pain's gone. handed off father like slightly lower
right shoulder. think gate probably thrown off this. probably genetic
thing, knows. handed off somebody. turns don't suffer back
pain fact, now don't suffer pain exercise
think helping medial glute. Two reasons raised this. One, know lot
guys right side sciatica 'cause people keep wallet one idea
left side sciatica. lot people male female think back
pain don't actually back pain. thing general
question biomechanics statement biomechanics. feeling
lot people think back pain knee pain neck pain headache shoulder
pain actually consequence something happening site
pain. whole landscape stuff related PT recovery pain
management. maybe just educate us bit works,
medial glute? make so-called back pain disappear?
people think pain? like use segue get little bit
deeper discussion pain recovery. - Sure. definitely like big
cornucopia PT stuff here, like love. first all, video,
proudest video have. reason helped many people. Like
get comments video every day. don't even know many views got
now, 30 million. - will link it. - lot views. quite
honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.
want try things first. far sort experienced
sometimes glute medias really tightens again, poor
biomechanics kinetic chain, can actually press sciatic nerve
give call pseudo sciatica. not like making up,


not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

honestly, little bit afterthought video terms origin. think
day maybe Jesse problems something like that, little bit low
back pain showed helped right away like, well, can make
video 'cause will help people. Not everybody, real disc problem,
not going help not changing structural problem there.
said, lot people don't even disc issues lot non-operative.

educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series

say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling

hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases

hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion

see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external

feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

not like not feeling pain sciatic distribution, not caused
disc, not caused something mechanical there, caused fact
gluteus posturely become problem weak don't train
need address it. So, unlike muscle body, common
trigger points common areas muscle will become tightened painful
spasmed can basically apply pressure areas sort thread
muscle pressure pushing contracting
muscle go action of, think call toast stabber,
like stabbing lifting stabbing lifting up. Taking glute
medias function. basically kind working underneath downward
pressure finger tends help almost need might
trigger point. people can see immediate relief
trigger point lets go, feels like, comments video. Like
God, literally, couldn't walk, hotel floor, fixed.
meanwhile come back body like, well, like like
this. ingrained be. might come back
another round another round finally starts say, right, not
going anymore. kind eases can relieve
trigger points. back. people get
sort inside shoulder blade, type cramping another
area. takes place, well, job think people like become
educated glute medias different glute maximus. Like functions
different. work not just extending hip also abduction
hip. External rotation hip, thing shoulder. actually segues
nicely what, whole concept talking about. Like body like
mirror image. hip like shoulder, right? ankle wrist. foot
hand. knee elbow, two hinge joints, function way. Well,
shoulder, got mobility comes freedom motion
stability lacking. Well, thing hip, like got mobility,
don't fully stabilize training muscles hip don't strengthen
external rotation hip, going issues. Like not
biomechanically going work way. think body series
bands pulling different directions different levels tension, pulled
one direction just balance tension one weak area one


dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish
studies,

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

dominantly tight area. need make sure can sort balance
order eliminate adaptations compensations happen.
say, look sort body whole, often wherever feeling
pain absolutely not blame. not blame. somewhere
hint that. talking about, knee favorite example it. Whenever
knee pain, patella tendonitis forever. bad, bad cases
tendonitis squatting difficult me. not knee, knee literally
hinge joint minor rotation capabilities knee hinge joint.
impacted hip ankle foot, said before, critical
foot is. thought knee like middle train track, femur
thigh shin knee, train track, well,
happen foot collapses bottom? sudden train track
bottom gets torqued just little bit. Well, going feel most, area
torquing, knee. stresses going felt
meanwhile problem foot problem ankle. People chronic
ankle sprainers almost always going wind back pain ankle
sprain causes weakness mal adaptations ankle gets connected
chain. now distort ankle shin, now knee
trying maintain ability hinge smoothly. toques femur that. Well,
femur now inside hip joint pulling pelvis pelvis whack.
really fascinating. Like one favorite things body works
like interconnected one little thing somewhere causes repercussion
somewhere else. easiest way find problem is, say, okay,
know symptom is, got find someone can help find source
somewhere else, going usually either below. Mostly, usually
'cause usually translates kinetic chain. usually going
real source is. people low back pain usually hip issues
weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, almost always below. get
really high performance athletics though, almost works way. Like
pitchers, can't, always fascinated guys Tommy John issues
elbow, right? Pitchers. Like can't externally rotate shoulder talked
about, again, ability get shoulder back external rotation. Well, arm
get certain position release baseball. can't get there,
can't externally rotate shoulder get elbow sort torque


order allow arm get back further. will try take motion
joint not really, again, hinge joint, really capable that.
starts stress media level ligament get little bit back
shoulder's not working just ultimately places strain elbow.
see guy pain floats around, pitcher floats around arm,
sort balance compensation. elbow starts hurting, can't
get range elbow, tries dig little bit back external
rotation rotator cuff gets inflamed feels inflamed,
way, time period, takes strain off elbow elbow
feels better. decides, okay, now got extra rotation, getting much
now starts straining elbow keeps going
cycle. body smart going compensate every single time.
going find compensation no guarantee compensation doesn't
leave whole host issues. - Yeah, fascinating. another lifetime,
would've gone PT although sounds like community among PTs
online... - don't know they, listen, good people like... - Yeah,
scientists neuroscientists can get pretty intense battles. Coming
academic community, etiquette different online say, think
person people probably behave bit differently. - shake hand say,
hello. - Yeah, shake hand say, hello. also, look, just
direct this. lot people online content pointing
misunderstandings alleged flaws people. like bulk
identity. sort sad existence always gain
thinking possible, new good. teach
demise win. - mean questioning healthy, normal, great,
actually sparks conversation. said, people's existence solely find
things nag not actually goal advance anything, rather
just to. - Yeah, world science skeptical not cynical encouraged.
always say longer somebody's career path certainly science
medicine realize hard various studies. publish

01:37:39 Tool: Properly Holding Weights & Deepening Grip



generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

generally sort get better understanding various things done.
case, along lines pain pain relief misunderstandings origins
pain body, one great tools picked content
benefit know huge number people think used hold weights sometimes
tips fingers opposed meat palm hands.
elbow pain. always thought that, felt tricep exercises pushing
exercise thought exercises wrong. Turns toward end
pull ups bicep work, letting weight bar drift fingertips.
mere shift making sure knuckles well bar
weight really meat palms completely ameliorated reasons
point maybe just share us kind
finger pull exercise. Usually someone says, pull finger, like bad middle
school elementary school joke... - Yeah, say push finger. - [Andrew]
Right, right. - know fascinating. just shows
intricate body responsive responsive can something
little. talking grip bar whether
curl whether through- mostly pulling exercises tendency
bar going fall hand not like pushing exercise
kind pushing hand bar. bench press say. bar can
drift just gravity thing fatigue hand grip strength. Can start drift
away towards distal digits. last couple knuckles
hands. though hand can still hold there, muscles not equipped
handle types loads. can start very, not going say light,
like start dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds
something depending upon overall strength levels. start apply
something like body weight chin up, right? 'Cause natural
bar somewhat kind float towards fingertips. actually little bit
easier perform exercise sort like false script little hook grip end
not going engage forearms exercise, not going
start pulling down. time help perform better
getting back activated, weakness muscles. 'Cause not
thing happens every, not one upright road type things think
happening everybody. happening people inherent
weaknesses muscles. haven't done enough gripping meat


hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

hand long enough starts put stress muscles ill-
equipped handle starts particularly fourth finger,
part muscle call FDS, flexor digitorum just much
handle. comes way meets right media level. Right
spot can say feels like someone's knifing right middle
medial level. medial epicondylitis call golfers elbow something lot
us deal gym. one common inflammatory conditions people
get gym comes positioning dumbbell barbell hand
pull-up bar time. easiest thing just grip deeper
using leverage palm encapsulate bar
dumbbell whatever not putting pressure really distally right last
digit FDS muscle strained. just almost
eliminating equation. one exercises load can
exceed capacity pretty quickly. like, maybe capable handling 30
pounds chin goes drifts far now
say 200 pound guy got say 100 pounds one arm
100 pounds, simplified math obviously offset muscles, 100
pounds one arm 100 pounds arm, 100 pounds off muscle can handle
30 not going take many repetitions strain going feel maybe
time set's certainly time workout's next day
wake got notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels
best thing determine, okay, exercises pulling
bar drifted deeper meat palm
fingers figure way deepen grip. happens though, best
thing inflammatory conditions not stuff
little while. Not ever, just little while. always things can around
it. not saying ever say, like, don't go gym don't find something can
do, saying particular exercise feel pain it,
never smart idea exercise inflamed. exercise
hurts, probably shouldn't exercise another reason variability
exercise many options can will train similar muscles
even motion not cause stress. So, mean, cable curl
much easier say chin don't control
weight like moving pin stack. think common thing


people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

people find best thing just figure deep gripping bar.
going find that, oh God, didn't realize just. Even
though might start set good position drifts away go. - think
happening conscious now. Again, me,
haven't elbow pain all. - [Jeff] great. - fortunate. again, debt
gratitude never- thought wrong elbow, basically.
thought maybe tennis elbow

01:43:54 Tool: Physical Recovery, Heat & Cold Exposure

don't even play tennis. go. aspects recovery variables
recovery. think put content use cold think can
summarize saying, yeah, seem like cold water immersion immediately
hypertrophy restrains workouts might problem, cold shower probably not
problem. heat? personally use heat cold saunas, hot baths, hot
compresses. you, mean personally athletes coach people
coach, thoughts use heat cold? - Well, think
might just inherited practice days trainers since babe Ruth.
baseball used lot cold following performance. Just idea
especially pitchers, inflammation abnormal. arm
not really designed especially speed move
everything else. use ice pretty standard practice that. not
lot heat use lot heat course recovery healing aspect
actually becomes rather personal preference found now say
first 12 24 hours really trying control inflammation might
injury. can kind shift personal preference heat can bring
blood area also cold sort antiinflammatory effects. like
balance one's working better you. really no
standard anymore heat cold way. standpoint like post-workout
healthy status, haven't used much heat cold terms do. cover
topic cold showers try dispel myth the, even people saying
giant testosterone releases know kinds stuff that. Listen, hear
kinds things 'cause people want- think idea just turning water cold
30 seconds sudden magically growing three times


size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

size intriguing lot people ask questions 'cause
like, well, hell lot easier going gym training
hard. like, always fascinated stuff talked about. fact,
started talk stuff terms cooling can
performance like untapped territory think
finding about. - Yeah, fun bring CoolMitt technology
Stanford. Craig Heller, colleague Craig Heller's lab Stanford's done
really important amazing work area moved
things. also working syndrome works number really
important topics scientists often do. access CoolMitt technology,
no relationship company, way, love come facility
can blind type studies. - Like blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
see goes somebody advanced trained probably
best thing do. content future. Yeah, think heat cold kind staples
PT world seem like people use slightly differently

01:47:19 Tool: Record Keeping Training Performance & Rest Time

kind macro nutrients recovery along sleep.
question precision record keeping. keep training journal?
recommend people keep training journals? neurotically fixed cadence
movement looking the, buzzer going off 90
seconds rest. 90 seconds rest? confess slow workouts faster
workouts. scale whether not training heavier longer rest.
whether not maybe midway workout, shift higher repetition,
lower rest. kind crude way keeping time. not- Will just kind
watch clock. not neurotically fixed buzzer social media
workouts. actually way really improve workouts just not
social media. - can't claim not guilty that. Sometimes social media
sometimes trying post something. - Well, different, profession.
profession. - mean, not necessarily chained sort protocol
terms do. think point long time not
something done long time, passion mine, something really
enjoy. probably inherently ability stick guidelines terms


rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

rest time know lifted. Even six months ago lift felt without
journaling it. recognize value lot people, goes back whole
muscle connection idea talked beginning. Like lack
awareness aspects training. especially maybe isn't like interest level.
talking position interest. Like do. enjoy just
bodies work understanding work. people don't care,
just want end result. journaling keeping track raises awareness
like, oh God, Instagram last seven minutes
supposed back next set 90 seconds. Like training effect that.
Like training metabolic overload, blown opportunity
haven't, rest time important protocol, working should.
training strength, maybe extra minutes doesn't matter much
get back bar might find, might find better response
body rest even longer told three, four minutes, five minutes.
way maybe helps, think anything can increase
awareness performance also give objective goal. Whenever
objective goal, lot easier actually obtain it. just
get pump just lift feel day, incredibly
disciplined aspects workout order make effective.
done too. actually able too, again, level repetitions
accumulated course life amount read stuff. think
able get away that, think often not not
journaling journaling head exactly think people
getting specific effect trying do. not haphazard. want
get specific effect just like experiment doing.
experiment body weight, one
empowering things someone can ever do. get bitten bug exercising
training like use word training rather exercise 'cause
purpose behind it. get bitten training bug start see
actual changes results, know empowering 'cause can't change,
can't really control many things life, unfortunately.
things happen us really wish never happened. not
something can anything about, one thing can best
to. can't avoid disease entirely, can't predict going die, can't


things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

things, can certainly decide show gym day get
workout go run something that, giving
think, better chance higher quality life. anything increase
awareness

01:51:47 Nutrition Principles & Consistency, Processed Foods & Sugar

keep track like endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more,
not agree more. topic sort dreaded topic, think important
one topic nutrition. rather get specific meal programs,
take take hours probably wouldn't even manage scratch surface
even hours. talk principles around nutrition. sort
themes think people keep mind thinking eat
generally pre-training post-training two particularly sensitive times most,
times people want know lot about. eat training
can train fasted? eat afterwards? just general,
think axioms nutrition really hold. ask 'cause, not
lot debate this, around space long time
seen works obviously people too. tends
work? tends not work? think nutrition? - mean, look,
touched bit like, nutrition can touchy subject people.
understand comes from. talked dogmatic
tendency nutrition, reason area people struggle
anything else. reason people struggle nutrition
commitment extremely high. start workout program
actually get gym three five times week. five hours based
discussing before. Well, 23 hours
days. opportunity eat incorrectly unhealthily every one hours.
People wake middle night go eat. Like things can
can cause amazing amounts damage longevity 23 hours not 1
hour, 23 hours. people finally figure way make work them,
passionate understand passion. like put out,
approach, approach like, always sort low sugar, lower fat guy.
made mistake going no fat years ago paid it. like college


back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

back day age. read magazines
had. didn't internet then. reading magazines
recommended path go low fat. helps become hypo caloric easily
density calories gram fat versus gram carbohydrates
protein nine versus four carbs protein. cutting grams fat
daily basis, quickly cutting calories allows get leaner. Well,
course everything, mean, little good, lot better. cut
almost age 22, 21, like standing stop
University Connecticut waiting tram come bring campus.
couldn't even open eyes light blinding me. normal sunlight.
blinding me, photosensitivity learning later
courses took biology necessary fat development
healthy cells. realized going not mention stuff skin bad,
hair falling out, kinds stuff. think approach decreasing fat
not excessive, calorically dense lower sugar.
firm believer sugar really pretty toxic something better
getting rid lot it. best approach for, believe, again, opinion,
personally, overall big picture. though people can take exclusionary
approaches nutrition taking carbs eating fats proteins, again,
not saying doesn't work you. first thing actually allowed
gain control nutrition point actually saw results got
healthier weight, always say, it, it. just make sure
something can forever doesn't bring upon repercussions. think
non exclusionary approaches diets sustainable rest
life. interested nutrition standpoint something sustainable.
preach preach, since 15, 14. People say like,
get ripped? get? four- many
years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. beginning
slow shift make like, went worst diet whole world.
Even 14 years old, breakfast was, talked many times,
Entenmann's eat Entenmann's donuts and... - long rod- - Yeah, long
[indistinct] - even took hole donut. - [Jeff] Exactly.
delete middle donut? - crumb donut there. eat donuts... - can
taste my- don't like sugar much years lost appetite


sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

sugar. talk entiments can literally smell taste frosting.
now disgusting back might appetizing. -
probably like really good information this, like ability actually
remember, said smell evoking memories, right? - smell unlike
senses direct line literally sense smell memory
centers brain. doesn't go intermediate stations. - Okay,
ability actually recall exact taste stuff used love enough
satisfy not engage things now. crazy is. Like almost get
feel remembering 'cause strong senses memory like,
'cause oh, used taste good. Okay, good, so... - Fantastic.
know neuromodulator there, dopamine. ability get dopamine
release thought things. people get dopamine
release, causes triggering desire more. - [Jeff] more. - Right, people
think dopamine pleasure. Dopamine, book, great book called, "The
Molecule More." didn't write book unfortunately, someone else
great book really dopamine think pleasure,
establishes craving. able satisfy adaptive thing
indeed lean one kind hallmark things
professional public space important people
talking getting lean look like, maybe need
protocols. huge advantage yeah, think that, sounds like
cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. not avoiding certain things
think easily avoided realize there, think enough
science literature prove altered path better path. know
mean? Like feel like just wanted lean, not
quite sure would've held long. - Well guest whose episode
recorded podcast runs eating disorder clinic University
Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD will
go record obesity, will go record saying highly palatable
processed high sugar foods sort talking about, donuts forth,
actually dangerous, right? elements way engage
neural circuitry. neurosurgeon reshape brain dangerous ways.
words and... - Yeah not just entiments. mean, think not just
entiments right? Yeah, coming us, what, donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly.



02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel

ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever

Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even

fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work

disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter

trade off harder trainer, think get results want able

20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now

02:00:15 Tool: “Plate Eating”: Protein, Fibrous & Starchy Carbohydrates

- Yeah, can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - case. terms
eat, structure terms of, look plate done
this, described before, think just beautifully simple description 'cause
think lot people don't want calorie counting people
think eat? - yeah, like call plate method just
simple 'cause works me. again, struggling real eating issues,
mechanisms become admittedly less effective maybe
emotionally triggered eating can't stop one plate. mean
get plate right portions control. - Plate dimensionality
height? - multiple plates like second third plate. - fourth. - Like
things can challenged say plate just simply
look like clock. just make 9:20 clock, one arm goes
9 one arms goes 20. Well, basically... going
take second largest portion 'cause going make line towards 12
o'clock too. largest portion going fibers carbohydrate.
green vegetables, right? whether broccoli Brussels sprouts, asparagus,
pick favorites. Like ones give us lot micronutrients
need, ones generally accepted healthy also
going provide fiber going beneficial terms impact
insulin also just filling up, right? take next largest portion
devote towards protein. think really important especially
anybody active, active embark trying build muscle
going need protein every meal. that. again, know,
talking cleaner sources protein. like, never find like boiled
chicken plate. Like ditched days 16 15 16, like realized
reading body building magazines maybe low fat thing stuck
long, no fat thing stuck long, boiled chicken steam broccoli
thing ended quickly 'cause really not going eat forever.
sort fish chicken it'll cooked way like got maybe
sauce got maybe tomato sauce. Anything just make
little bit palatable interesting without blowing value meal.


last portion put starchy carbohydrates. again, part
people will say exclude entirely 'cause not healthy don't work
not beneficial long term. God sent. think
like people body craves carbohydrates. choose things like sweet
potatoes favorite rice pasta. Italian like pasta.
like will things, not excluding them, don't put
portions generally find. wife will go go
restaurant sometimes travel quite bit used least baseball too.
cheesecake factory everywhere went love cheesecake factory,
like way structure meals rice bottom, little bit chicken
top. mean, plateful rice wouldn't find make plate way.
going just devote portion plate starchy carbohydrate.
gives little bit responsibility terms portion control 'cause
foods, again, probably dopamine driven easily eaten. always ask
question, last time ate 10 chicken breasts meal? Like getting
sick maybe two three, eat whole hell lot
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates just satisfying think
triggers, said, want more, like happens, right? just keep
eating, even feeling full, want more. biggest danger
carbohydrate. can develop sort discipline around them, can
still enjoy them. can't develop discipline whatever reason, maybe
become something work around adopt different eating
style. said, never point not trying dogmatic
approach. always trying say, believer just like
everyone else's believer method, open idea something
works gets healthier weight sustainability, like good,
good me. Provided doesn't introduce issues. - Something one can
consistently, something picked years. can
consistently? me, also meant, when, can eat? can eat
consistently will also allow alert lunch can actually get work
done. eat, like train fasted morning don't long term fasting.
just happens fine water caffeine morning training
morning eat first meal afterwards. get carbohydrates night
glycogen restored. think carbohydrates wonderful. just don't eat excess.


me, feel like describe rational literally balanced
approach. obviously will variations people dealing obesity
diabetes. got friends pure carnivore thing, friends
vegan always impressive somebody can stick anything
consistently except sticking just poor behavior. 'Cause nothing
impressive that. Well, think helpful think there's,-
typical listener podcast, online content people see, battles
confusing. distracting. people really think, oh, right way
wrong way sounds like way one can eat consistently time
healthy. Certainly fewer processed sugary foods, think almost everybody agrees
there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees that, right? think calorie manipulation
method. even intermittent fasting, like said, like
be, people grazers. Like grazer real problem
portion control course day, can respond rule says, no,
eating here, can obey rule. Well, not going
able graze times might additional damage. sure
hormonal benefits people will talk approach.
longevity standpoint habit forming standpoint, fixing habit
breaking often eating throughout whenever feel like walk food,
good works. again, people can, will tell can probably eat whatever
want eat long eating within window. think
responsible people practitioners will say, no, still want avoid
processed sugar things like that. just mechanism eating not really
diet. like think people- hate like basic sounds
exact reason 23 hour day phenomenon like, said
impressed, impressive. hard control behaviors food
one hardest thing. One biggest temptations people. got
learn control long day day day, whatever
mechanism works impressive believer it. think
feel. just feel like people need able given reigns able find
works them. - Well, love eat one beauties weight training
feel like can eat plenty age not lean are, happy
at. always better. year actually getting better probably
eating cleaner. Probably 'cause also someone cook now.


like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning

general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,

younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever

workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30

little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside

researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf

think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs

watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

like... too. - like healthy food fortunate. don't
think packaged food home. even started making sauerkraut
home, don't make it. mean makes it. - wife actually turned tip
actually shared whole channel like, can go to,
Stew Leonard's around big grocery store chain around us catering
department. often used catering big parties big tubs grilled
chicken, like really good grilled chicken. Again, not boiled chicken big tubs
sweet potatoes. get bunch go get
sort arrange plates put plates like, okay
repetitive eating. think people probably okay repetitive eating
think. think actually break many different breakfast variations,
have? Three, two. - Two three maximum. - like, think people
variety dinner probably like even probably eat five different
types dinners course week month. Well, ability
identify things like, again, no plan going work eating stuff
don't like. not going work forever, nothing will, really enjoy
eating. long variations meal something really
enjoy limited versions them, reproducibility simple. will
take time fortunate enough case somebody can
prepare you, now even part equation. just makes
simple. think tally costs medical care spiked
poor nutrition offset might cost invest
faster strategy like catering trick whatever might be, best off figuring
way maybe reallocate money preparing
important long term health longevity. can figure nutrition
issues, everyone listening podcast can figure nutrition issues,
whole world will different. like one largest sources disease, pain
discomfort people really struggle nutrition. - Yeah, huge
problem. mean obesity, epidemic country. very, serious.
Also lot highly processed foods expensive healthier foods
really break down.

02:11:25 Training Men vs. Women, Training Kids & Adolescents



Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy

Even better sourced high quality foods right par less processed
foods sure. couple questions relates training. think
one thing lot people wonder maybe kind true
false method just get these... - 50/50 get right least. - Exactly.
Men women train differently. - science will say false. again, not
generalize, kind point touched earlier today. find casually
interested women training will migrate towards certain types fitness, like
kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. think,
again, whatever going engage regularly do.
Physiologically, no. think can get women feel comfortable
gym performing exercises same, receiving strength
training benefits working progressive overload like, hit holy grail.
think big bridge gapped still just
reality to- Listen, very, wife perfect example living
complicated busy life. two young boys twins attention focus
there. like, doesn't living like do. can get decent
workout happy, not necessarily working deadlift PR.
think help serve long term work increasing
PRs, different lifts building strength progressively. life right now
not necessarily cards time focus that.
discourage thing might find interesting, like boxing.
little, don't remember brand, like one punchable boxing standup things
enjoys it. Like anything get moving going preferable don't think
necessarily physiologically difference. - started weight training pretty
young. - Yeah. messed around brother 'cause older, four years
older. kind messing around weights probably 12 13 5 pound
dumbbell. - Yeah, hear young kids shouldn't work weights. don't
know going standard is. Now say, shuts long bone growth growth
plates sort thing. got two young boys adorable kids way. - [Jeff]
Thanks. - One things heartwarming see great shape,
clearly extremely bright, know craft, loved craft. work
Jesse, talk well. - [Jeff] great. - great.
camaraderie there, great teammates part business work
just makes life better. just honest. grateful great teammates


podcast lab, course, well. see boys dogs
whole picture, sure lot contours complexity don't know
shouldn't know about, beautiful picture. will weight train? seen
videos one hanging bar. - kids naturals,
telling that. - wonder get from. - don't even encourage it. not
going dad sitting saying, go somewhere. got two days.
not going natural interest gym. just sometimes
like daddy. come there. two us, wife will
one little bit longer leash let explore things 'cause
dummy times figured best mistakes made. -
injury, right. neuroscience call one trial learning. - go. guys
going masters one trial learning know, go grab bars
my, handles jamer 'cause lower level
swinging around pull-ups naturally uncoached nothing me. One
will walk deadlift bar stand naturally never saw it, stands
just goes, tries pull it. definitely inclination liking gym
will fully support that. course body weight will good quite while. - Yeah,
age think reasonable kids start exploring non body weight
training? - think around 13. think around 13. puberty, think okay start to.
'Cause much, even say people like later age just
starting out, learn body weight first, plenty resistance
learning command body space. never trained before,
going get stimulated lunging reverse lunging, even learning
appropriate reception around movement space. Pull-ups, chin ups.
Pull-ups chin ups challenging even people 20, 30 years
experience gym. lot stimulus body weight jumping
straight dumbbells barbells actually disservice. can learn
better command body space go back bigger lifts,
going easier time sort progressively loading building
foundation strength. not saying become master calisthenics
athlete can touch barbell, not even true. just saying
much capacity. Kids going anyway. really just, look
general play, jumping, lunging, climbing, pulling like,
do. don't know avoidance like structured training


younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys

might finally get locked say, really like off
running. - enjoy content. remiss didn't
briefly discuss Jesse. One great pleasures watching content
learning years took a, decided mentor somebody,
Jesse. poking fun back forth two
amusing. say inspired something early developing
podcast young intern helped research
buddy, interested science, go off college, also got really
fitness. watch videos guys. helping get
Instagram content early on. one thing just, pleasure
able pass along knowledge course learning him. always
way works. learn teaching learn students. great


see Jesse's progress, amazing. gotten meet person just now
grown, changed physically. think mentioned love fitness.
think one best ways consistent take responsibility
teaching others. one proficiency something. maybe just tell us little
bit going. Jesse need little
work, thriving? impressed progress. - Well a, mean,
physically, can obviously see changes, list things work immense
long continue improve. no actually, reality, Jesse, story
Jesse knew Jesse prior starting even Athlean-X. matter fact, think
funny thing first video ever posted channel video
shot don't know, 13 year old something. said, can just film
second. training members family. off went off
college, went film, realized much greener pastures Athlean-X instead
becoming next [indistinct] something decided come work me.
expectations beginning just edit videos just help various
aspects like day day don't think equipped really handle grow
business anymore. look virtue environment,
interest. think worked gym, might become interested working out.
though mine not commercial gym sitting right behind office window,
became interest wanting work little bit. wasn't even
intentional experiment put Jesse there. just thought likable person.
funny personality also the, every man. ways sure
maybe experience sometimes like guy comes naturally
people will say. Like, living. Like you- Like
element disconnect terms relatability
living. can't deny work professional athletes. like level
interest beyond. him, just kid wants train.
Maybe rolls bed 11:00 doesn't date Friday night,
guy everybody relate to. watching transform love
fact even interest level down. Like wasn't consistent
like, part interested maybe not interested three months
interested not. never pushed him. again, no
orchestrated experiment me. just like, want this, this.
also standpoint like lending help expertise him, like said,


son, not going force anybody, don't want anybody. don't think
ever going spark desire long term adoption. got
interested, started learn it, watched just videos
filming. films videos filming learning saying
becoming student field. say knowledge field
grown growth physique. put practice things
say, put practice things hears places winds
improving goes winds starting love like never thought
would. great see anybody grow whether physically
emotionally whether just career, great see somebody grow.
like tease him. Funny admission here, times jabs will throw
something might know ahead time going say him.
People will say mean him. can't believe abusive. Like,
dude, honestly, laugh over. good, good. course, like... -
tougher looks saying. - [Jeff] tougher looks,
believe me. - looks tough, got big beard. - looks manly
do. can't grow beard, don't, mean, believe me, totally alpha like
quickly becoming second star show, like definitely contributed
people enjoy presence sure. - Yeah, certainly do. think pointed
out, kind proxy template everybody. can relate
even though trained many years, struggle graduate school,
post, made happen one way another, less attention admittedly
waxing waning levels motivation although fortunate enjoy it. -
think nice realistic expectation set. 'Cause
showcasing journey actually looks like. journey
devotedly say last year half journey five years.
make gains starting started training 14, 15,
saying, hey, 20, going strength levels does, physique
does, knowledge gained. Like seems like blink eye now
looking back. 46 years old, like, holy cow. Like think took 20 years, 15, 20
years just even start get groove. period five years,
doesn't seem long whereas people will criticize journey like, oh, just
taking long like instant gratification people seek, luckily
minority. people like, amazing, think becomes


uplifting not relatable journey real people can appreciate
that. Like, will happen actually put consistent hard work
watch transform go back watch videos like look at. like
oftentimes throw back videos appeared smaller Jesse also shy
Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact camera now
got skits intros. like funny confidence
growth physique came confidence too, great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll
world living say. Well, behalf
listeners, really want thank you. First all, discussion today, learned
immense amount even though thought knew content well, still learned
immense amount, many things deploy stretch, stretch,
skipping rope. talked nutrition, talked heat cold training regimens.
love now given us backbone
logic consistent themes indeed consistency. logical backbone,
think will enable people really show table stay training
consistently time. said, gift fitness immense gift. can't
thank enough. know incredibly busy human kids dogs
marriage and... - pleasure. happy able make work 'cause really
watching stuff while. really love science it, like way
think. just, just really fortunate able it.

younger kids. Again, provided using body weight maybe less ballistic
movements something like that. Things are, certainly overloaded movements.
think encourage kids more. lot obesity kids rise
also incredibly disconcerting me. think hope doesn't come
advice say, well, wait older start something like.
way worse trade off engaging something smart now. - used get
kicked house kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - mom kick us out.
huge pack boys lived street get kicked outside. Like literal,
not allowed in, no television. video games, course
kicked house. go play.

02:18:05 Tool: Pre- Post-Training Nutrition

us skateboarding, soccer find trouble. post training
nutrition. age, years ago sort neurotic idea
ingest certain amount carbohydrates proteins within two hours 90
minutes training. confess get, train hard, talking resistance
training not running. resistance training, 60 90 minutes later, really
hungry. days just skip hunger passes
later eat more. might eat twice much later just way sometimes schedules
go. thoughts terms nutrition science, training related
effects post-training meal? something try get? something
think people pay attention to? - science actually probably
one changed lifetime, honestly, because, again,
age falling trap really focused like,
risking speeding tickets driving home gym make sure got anabolic
window. Like that, really did. thankfully sort debunked
body isn't just rushing certain periods time utilize nutrients
body, able partition use long, much greater duration.
now, saying, three four hours training, five hours training,
still see benefits replenishment. lot just think
consistency element just utilizing post workout window post workout
meal, even within two hours one hour just integrating habit saying,
listen, just activity now want replenish lost energy


used perform exercises did. just getting routine knowing
engine ultimately fed put it. concept replenishing fuel
lost still concept think again, different mechanism still important terms
fueling overall performance. pre-workout period time gives us chance
actually longer window nutrients obtained pre-workout,
not like gone hour trained, still available
body use. think important get one two right least make sure
consistently one two might risk going
periods no nutrition support efforts. Not will workouts
potentially suffer terms output, also not providing body
ability capitalize opportunity feed refuel recover. not
dogmatic specifically eat pre post workout. think
protein surrounding training, whether ahead time after. Protein
little bit hard digest people. pre-workout
finding workout slogging don't feel good suddenly
put meal. whole concept urgency time thankfully
removed can just learn eat little bit responsibly drive
responsibly not trying rush home gym risk killing people
way. think great think something just showcases
belief people long since proven not important.
tip cap towards research good way like, right,
think agree isn't necessarily true anymore. look
say, oh God, often. bit one hook line sinker realize,
okay, always make change. good thing nutrition
changes can happen next time go eat start see benefits
that. not big believer strict approach pre post-workout. mean,
even far pre-workout supplements, lot people don't take them. lot people
don't like them, don't take them, don't like, not necessarily even
used new nutritive side pre-workout. just used fuel
workout. - water form caffeine. - Yeah. mean, whatever,
again, think important. think important maintain high level output.
pre-work attrition requires stimulant order help pre-
work nutrition causing harder time train feeling full
stomachache something else, not achieving trying do.


ultimate goal still able perform highest level. whatever
nutrition required allow still that, probably important factor
it. - Great, love clear rational approach. Don't ingest anything right
workout near workout going make workout worse.
Yeah, simple yet don't hear think people will think, oh,
must pre-workout must post-workout. - No, again, even
benefits whatever's suggested going easily offset
fact can't perform output capable driving change.
pretty much negate fact not outweighing benefits whatever
nutritive approach took struggling workout. - me, best
pre-workout good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, music. - Yeah, go.
mean, simple formula. - works. post find get quite
hungry want eat quite bit and... - Well, natural response body's
going people want think fed. work
know, again, lot postings Instagram will happen 10 o'clock night, 10:30
night, 11 night, 'cause actually training taking
little breaks sets actually film post something. like, go inside
eat dinner. eating 11 o'clock night. not necessarily ideal, not
recommending tool anybody. think dispels one thing, never
believer Kenny carbs six. - makes no sense me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. -
Based new, signs metabolism seen makes no sense. think
long can, sort like napping. talked Matt Walker, one great sleep
researchers wrote sleep, et cetera, podcast sleep,
tremendous researcher, public communicator sleep said, naps fine
provided don't interrupt ability sleep well night. Simple. people can
sleep eight 9:00 PM go bed midnight not problem.
people take 30 minute nap lunch can't sleep night. thing
with- Caffeine's little different Matt argue architecture sleep can
disrupted, et cetera. can eat dinner late eat carbohydrates late,
actually need carbohydrates night order able sleep. Whenever done
low carbohydrate type regimen evening, hard time falling asleep. just
alert. eat carbohydrates evening restore glycogen also order
make sure can fall asleep. - actually can, obviously already late
night, time done eating, like can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes


finishing meal. think effect me,
never, not bothered feeling fullness. not unable sleep
feeling fullness. like fact feel least replenishing
lost hard training. like back dinner. don't need eat
smaller amounts. people can't much. will say hard leg workout,
don't appetite say, upper body workout. can really
disrupt whole feeling wellbeing. - want eat less train legs? -
[Jeff] do, yeah. - Oh, wow, opposite. - No, 'cause feel sick
stomach. - clearly training harder.

02:26:30 Intensity & Training Consistency

seen way train, train intensely. - Yeah. think important.
mean, think that... Again, trade off between, not going train long
period time going want train harder. again, actually feel like
contrary people might think age, better off training harder
shorter period time. always within realm safe training. mean, think
like think bring table. Like approach smarter
can train harder. Like not dumb things kid.
trade off harder trainer, think get results want able
really push back off again, meal feels like almost physiological
reward hard effort put gym knowing also replenishing setting
stage next day another successful day training maybe not
depending upon many times day week train. think it's, lot less,
hate say lot less scientific want make it. seems
coming back oftentimes like thing works really important thing
ultimately getting ass really thing
provides best benefit. - Absolutely, many things say
hallmarks Jeff Cavaliere, one certainly consistency. make
happen one way another. - Huge. mean, consistency really determinant.
know hardest part people are, people tend look
shortcut, 'cause consistency part becomes biggest challenge.
find, listen, find the, know trying
encourage like find nutrition approach, find


training approach, try find training split, try things
encourage want go gym. Like locked point
said actually look forward going workout. - love it. look forward
to, mean, it's- Actually morning, one teammates podcast got
workout halfway just turned said, never figure
feels good, feels good. just, really enjoy lets, love eat
lets eat right love way makes feel afterward. don't understand
concept not enjoying gym. Cardio's little different, always loathe first 10
20 minutes jog. mildly loathe middle third end, think
greatest thing ever, don't want time. feeling evaporates
next time it. - Yeah, course don't even remember either,
get on, again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - think people could, one gift
give everybody love fitness. bestowed
love fitness change entire world. think hear things like this,
like, hey, will work will work will work too. Rather
dogmatic one way approach, become discouraging people.
think becomes little bit uplifting like, well, never tried that. actually
never tried total body split never tried style eating. Like becomes
encouraging might want explore

02:29:53 AthleanX, Jesse Laico & Fitness Journeys
